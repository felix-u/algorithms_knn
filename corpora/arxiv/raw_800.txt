cs.AI:Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search tree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress toward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches.
cs.AI:Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.
cs.AI:We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.
cs.AI:As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.
cs.AI:To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information, this paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers with two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is going to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user interface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and constructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of the note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting archive. Macintosh utilities for binhex are available from mac.archive.umich.edu. QuickTime is available from ftp.apple.com in the dts/mac/sys.soft/quicktime.
cs.AI:Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages (or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted.
cs.AI:A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.
cs.AI:Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling. Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for decision-tree learning algorithms.
cs.AI:The ability to identify interesting and repetitive substructures is an essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe a new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery system, written in C. The program accepts as input databases represented in graph form, and will output discovered substructures with their corresponding value.
cs.AI:The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.
cs.AI:We report on a series of experiments in which all decision trees consistent with the training data are constructed. These experiments were run to gain an understanding of the properties of the set of consistent decision trees and the factors that affect the accuracy of individual trees. In particular, we investigated the relationship between the size of a decision tree consistent with some training data and the accuracy of the tree on test data. The experiments were performed on a massively parallel Maspar computer. The results of the experiments on several artificial and two real world problems indicate that, for many of the problems investigated, smaller consistent decision trees are on average less accurate than the average accuracy of slightly larger trees.
cs.AI:This paper analyzes the correctness of the subsumption algorithm used in CLASSIC, a description logic-based knowledge representation system that is being used in practical applications. In order to deal efficiently with individuals in CLASSIC descriptions, the developers have had to use an algorithm that is incomplete with respect to the standard, model-theoretic semantics for description logics. We provide a variant semantics for descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete, and which can be independently motivated. The soundness and completeness of the polynomial-time subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs, which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in CLASSIC, and are of independent interest.
cs.AI:In this paper we describe how to modify GSAT so that it can be applied to non-clausal formulas. The idea is to use a particular ``score'' function which gives the number of clauses of the CNF conversion of a formula which are false under a given truth assignment. Its value is computed in linear time, without constructing the CNF conversion itself. The proposed methodology applies to most of the variants of GSAT proposed so far.
cs.AI:Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods.
cs.AI:Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance.
cs.AI:This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees. This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.
cs.AI:This paper introduces a framework for Planning while Learning where an agent is given a goal to achieve in an environment whose behavior is only partially known to the agent. We discuss the tractability of various plan-design processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However, coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection) part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner.
cs.AI:The vast amounts of on-line text now available have led to renewed interest in information extraction (IE) systems that analyze unrestricted text, producing a structured representation of selected information from the text. This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction. Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically. Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring manual customization for each domain.
cs.AI:This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.
cs.AI:For many years, the intuitions underlying partial-order planning were largely taken for granted. Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest in the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we present a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order planning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.
cs.AI:Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k ``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems.
cs.AI:The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph.
cs.AI:Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda &gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.
cs.AI:This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for cost-sensitive classification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases for a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for cost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its advantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a way to improve the search.
cs.AI:Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.
cs.AI:Many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of structural properties of the constraint network; others take into account semantic properties of the constraints, generally assuming that all the constraints possess the given property. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not bijective constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore, not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs.
cs.AI:We study the process of multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of load balancing in a distributed system, without use of either central coordination or explicit communication. We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. Finally, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even harm system efficiency.
cs.AI:Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory.
cs.AI:We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logic programs in polynomial time from equivalence queries. In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an additional ``basecase'' oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive logic programs.
cs.AI:In a companion paper it was shown that the class of constant-depth determinate k-ary recursive clauses is efficiently learnable. In this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn: programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses; programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean DNF. Together with positive results from the companion paper, these negative results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive function-free clauses.
cs.AI:There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the "best" possible planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient planning strategies.
cs.AI:This paper presents a method for inducing logic programs from examples that learns a new class of concepts called first-order decision lists, defined as ordered lists of clauses each ending in a cut. The method, called FOIDL, is based on FOIL (Quinlan, 1990) but employs intensional background knowledge and avoids the need for explicit negative examples. It is particularly useful for problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the symbolic/connectionist debate. FOIDL is able to learn concise, accurate programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples than previous methods (both connectionist and symbolic).
cs.AI:ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.
cs.AI:Identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a significant and difficult problem in AI. In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra. The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the conventional methods used in many similar systems.
cs.AI:Learning and reasoning are both aspects of what is considered to be intelligence. Their studies within AI have been separated historically, learning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning falling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are in many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these interdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines inductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a propositional setting. Several examples that test the framework are presented, including classical induction, many important reasoning protocols and two simple expert systems.
cs.AI:This paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition probability matrices in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and how it makes very difficult the task of learning to represent long-term context for sequential data. This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm.
cs.AI:Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization, constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset.
cs.AI:Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function. Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership value.
cs.AI:This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.
cs.AI:OPUS is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables efficient admissible search through spaces for which the order of search operator application is not significant. The algorithm's search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to very large machine learning search spaces. The use of admissible search is of potential value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact learning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be precisely specified and manipulated. OPUS also has potential for application in other areas of artificial intelligence, notably, truth maintenance.
cs.AI:The main aim of this work is the development of a vision-based road detection system fast enough to cope with the difficult real-time constraints imposed by moving vehicle applications. The hardware platform, a special-purpose massively parallel system, has been chosen to minimize system production and operational costs. This paper presents a novel approach to expectation-driven low-level image segmentation, which can be mapped naturally onto mesh-connected massively parallel SIMD architectures capable of handling hierarchical data structures. The input image is assumed to contain a distorted version of a given template; a multiresolution stretching process is used to reshape the original template in accordance with the acquired image content, minimizing a potential function. The distorted template is the process output.
cs.AI:In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.
cs.AI:We present a definition of cause and effect in terms of decision-theoretic primitives and thereby provide a principled foundation for causal reasoning. Our definition departs from the traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with the set of decisions available. We argue that this approach provides added clarity to the notion of cause. Also in this paper, we examine the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs. We describe a special class of influence diagrams, those in canonical form, and show its relationship to Pearl's representation of cause and effect. Finally, we show how canonical form facilitates counterfactual reasoning.
cs.AI:Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it.
cs.AI:This article describes an application of three well-known statistical methods in the field of game-tree search: using a large number of classified Othello positions, feature weights for evaluation functions with a game-phase-independent meaning are estimated by means of logistic regression, Fisher's linear discriminant, and the quadratic discriminant function for normally distributed features. Thereafter, the playing strengths are compared by means of tournaments between the resulting versions of a world-class Othello program. In this application, logistic regression - which is used here for the first time in the context of game playing - leads to better results than the other approaches.
cs.AI:We describe a machine learning method for predicting the value of a real-valued function, given the values of multiple input variables. The method induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form (DNF) decision rules. A central objective of the method and representation is the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression performance.
cs.AI:Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems that are of practical size.
cs.AI:The paper describes an extension of well-founded semantics for logic programs with two types of negation. In this extension information about preferences between rules can be expressed in the logical language and derived dynamically. This is achieved by using a reserved predicate symbol and a naming technique. Conflicts among rules are resolved whenever possible on the basis of derived preference information. The well-founded conclusions of prioritized logic programs can be computed in polynomial time. A legal reasoning example illustrates the usefulness of the approach.
cs.AI:Traditional databases commonly support efficient query and update procedures that operate in time which is sublinear in the size of the database. Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology.
cs.AI:We introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that is capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP search problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained problems.
cs.AI:We develop a mean field theory for sigmoid belief networks based on ideas from statistical mechanics. Our mean field theory provides a tractable approximation to the true probability distribution in these networks; it also yields a lower bound on the likelihood of evidence. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on a benchmark problem in statistical pattern recognition---the classification of handwritten digits.
cs.AI:A reported weakness of C4.5 in domains with continuous attributes is addressed by modifying the formation and evaluation of tests on continuous attributes. An MDL-inspired penalty is applied to such tests, eliminating some of them from consideration and altering the relative desirability of all tests. Empirical trials show that the modifications lead to smaller decision trees with higher predictive accuracies. Results also confirm that a new version of C4.5 incorporating these changes is superior to recent approaches that use global discretization and that construct small trees with multi-interval splits.
cs.AI:For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the statistically `optimal' way to select training data. In this paper, we review how optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural networks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance.
cs.AI:Inductive theorem provers often diverge. This paper describes a simple critic, a computer program which monitors the construction of inductive proofs attempting to identify diverging proof attempts. Divergence is recognized by means of a ``difference matching'' procedure. The critic then proposes lemmas and generalizations which ``ripple'' these differences away so that the proof can go through without divergence. The critic enables the theorem prover Spike to prove many theorems completely automatically from the definitions alone.
cs.AI:Termination of logic programs with negated body atoms (here called general logic programs) is an important topic. One reason is that many computational mechanisms used to process negated atoms, like Clark's negation as failure and Chan's constructive negation, are based on termination conditions. This paper introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs w.r.t. the Prolog selection rule. The idea is to distinguish parts of the program depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection rule. To this end, the notions of low-, weakly up-, and up-acceptable program are introduced. We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of terminating general logic programs.
cs.AI:Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions.
cs.AI:This paper presents new experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor. A~systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning.
cs.AI:The main operations in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are generalization and specialization, which only make sense in a generality order. In ILP, the three most important generality orders are subsumption, implication and implication relative to background knowledge. The two languages used most often are languages of clauses and languages of only Horn clauses. This gives a total of six different ordered languages. In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of these six ordered sets. We survey results already obtained by others and also contribute some answers of our own. Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a computable least generalization under implication of every finite set of clauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among other, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a least generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if both the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are function-free. Thirdly, we give a complete discussion of existence and non-existence of greatest specializations in each of the six ordered languages.
cs.AI:This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.
cs.AI:Although most scheduling problems are NP-hard, domain specific techniques perform well in practice but are quite expensive to construct. In adaptive problem-solving solving, domain specific knowledge is acquired automatically for a general problem solver with a flexible control architecture. In this approach, a learning system explores a space of possible heuristic methods for one well-suited to the eccentricities of the given domain and problem distribution. In this article, we discuss an application of the approach to scheduling satellite communications. Using problem distributions based on actual mission requirements, our approach identifies strategies that not only decrease the amount of CPU time required to produce schedules, but also increase the percentage of problems that are solvable within computational resource limitations.
cs.AI:Speedup learning seeks to improve the computational efficiency of problem solving with experience. In this paper, we develop a formal framework for learning efficient problem solving from random problems and their solutions. We apply this framework to two different representations of learned knowledge, namely control rules and macro-operators, and prove theorems that identify sufficient conditions for learning in each representation. Our proofs are constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a unified fashion. We illustrate our framework with implementations in two domains: symbolic integration and Eight Puzzle. This work integrates many strands of experimental and theoretical work in machine learning, including empirical learning of control rules, macro-operator learning, Explanation-Based Learning (EBL), and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning.
cs.AI:A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures.
cs.AI:An important problem in geometric reasoning is to find the configuration of a collection of geometric bodies so as to satisfy a set of given constraints. Recently, it has been suggested that this problem can be solved efficiently by symbolically reasoning about geometry. This approach, called degrees of freedom analysis, employs a set of specialized routines called plan fragments that specify how to change the configuration of a set of bodies to satisfy a new constraint while preserving existing constraints. A potential drawback, which limits the scalability of this approach, is concerned with the difficulty of writing plan fragments. In this paper we address this limitation by showing how these plan fragments can be automatically synthesized using first principles about geometric bodies, actions, and topology.
cs.AI:Motivated by the control theoretic distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events, we distinguish between two types of agents within a multi-agent system: controllable agents, which are directly controlled by the system's designer, and uncontrollable agents, which are not under the designer's direct control. We refer to such systems as partially controlled multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in the other they are reinforcement learners. We suggest different techniques for controlling agents' behavior in each domain, assess their success, and examine their relationship.
cs.AI:Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines.
cs.AI:Finding the stable models of a knowledge base is a significant computational problem in artificial intelligence. This task is at the computational heart of truth maintenance systems, autoepistemic logic, and default logic. Unfortunately, it is NP-hard. In this paper we present a hierarchy of classes of knowledge bases, Omega_1,Omega_2,..., with the following properties: first, Omega_1 is the class of all stratified knowledge bases; second, if a knowledge base Pi is in Omega_k, then Pi has at most k stable models, and all of them may be found in time O(lnk), where l is the length of the knowledge base and n the number of atoms in Pi; third, for an arbitrary knowledge base Pi, we can find the minimum k such that Pi belongs to Omega_k in time polynomial in the size of Pi; and, last, where K is the class of all knowledge bases, it is the case that union{i=1 to infty} Omega_i = K, that is, every knowledge base belongs to some class in the hierarchy.
cs.AI:We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.
cs.AI:Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods.
cs.AI:This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation, that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain, which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict', the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes.
cs.AI:First-order learning involves finding a clause-form definition of a relation from examples of the relation and relevant background information. In this paper, a particular first-order learning system is modified to customize it for finding definitions of functional relations. This restriction leads to faster learning times and, in some cases, to definitions that have higher predictive accuracy. Other first-order learning systems might benefit from similar specialization.
cs.AI:This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem). This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP.
cs.AI:A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.
cs.AI:Efficiently entering information into a computer is key to enjoying the benefits of computing. This paper describes three intelligent user interfaces: handwriting recognition, adaptive menus, and predictive fillin. In the context of adding a personUs name and address to an electronic organizer, tests show handwriting recognition is slower than typing on an on-screen, soft keyboard, while adaptive menus and predictive fillin can be twice as fast. This paper also presents strategies for applying these three interfaces to other information collection domains.
cs.AI:Decomposable dependency models possess a number of interesting and useful properties. This paper presents new characterizations of decomposable models in terms of independence relationships, which are obtained by adding a single axiom to the well-known set characterizing dependency models that are isomorphic to undirected graphs. We also briefly discuss a potential application of our results to the problem of learning graphical models from data.
cs.AI:Instance-based learning techniques typically handle continuous and linear input values well, but often do not handle nominal input attributes appropriately. The Value Difference Metric (VDM) was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes, requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values. This paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions, called the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM), the Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), and the Windowed Value Difference Metric (WVDM). These new distance functions are designed to handle applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both. In experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve higher classification accuracy on average than three previous distance functions on those datasets that have both nominal and continuous attributes.
cs.AI:Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.
cs.AI:Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept) and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.
cs.AI:We argue that the analysis of agent/environment interactions should be extended to include the conventions and invariants maintained by agents throughout their activity. We refer to this thicker notion of environment as a lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity. As one specific example, we apply the tools to the analysis of the Toast system and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the environment.
cs.AI:We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching.
cs.AI:An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally be able to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computing power and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability to generalize. Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks.
cs.AI:Several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency of alternative flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link (POCL) planning. We review this literature, and present new experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some of the discrepancies in it. In particular, we describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.
cs.AI:We investigate the computational properties of the spatial algebra RCC-5 which is a restricted version of the RCC framework for spatial reasoning. The satisfiability problem for RCC-5 is known to be NP-complete but not much is known about its approximately four billion subclasses. We provide a complete classification of satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and NP-complete respectively. In the process, we identify all maximal tractable subalgebras which are four in total.
cs.AI:The easy-hard-easy pattern in the difficulty of combinatorial search problems as constraints are added has been explained as due to a competition between the decrease in number of solutions and increased pruning. We test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems, rather than changing numbers of solutions.
cs.AI:This paper combines two important directions of research in temporal resoning: that of finding maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra, and that of reasoning with metric temporal information. Eight new maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra are presented, some of them subsuming previously reported tractable algebras. The algebras allow for metric temporal constraints on interval starting or ending points, using the recent framework of Horn DLRs. Two of the algebras can express the notion of sequentiality between intervals, being the first such algebras admitting both qualitative and metric time.
cs.AI:Starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds, we extend it to a likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way, and examine the resulting logic. Lewis earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference order on worlds. Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning.
cs.AI:Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical results.
cs.AI:SEQUITUR is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical structure from a sequence of discrete symbols by replacing repeated phrases with a grammatical rule that generates the phrase, and continuing this process recursively. The result is a hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which offers insights into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that reduce the size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR breaks new ground by operating incrementally. Moreover, the method's simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation can process 50,000 symbols per second and has been applied to an extensive range of real world sequences.
cs.AI:Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure.
cs.AI:Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all previous exact algorithms.
cs.AI:The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area.
cs.AI:Local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems frequently encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to improve the value of the objective function; moves through these regions, called plateau moves, dominate the time spent in local search. We analyze and characterize plateaus for three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability problems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave similarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search algorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we discuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms.
cs.AI:The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.
cs.AI:Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz (1991, 1996) as a form of ``knowledge compilation,'' supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by Kavvadias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates.
cs.AI:An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is their nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics.
cs.AI:Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two categories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain independent planners.
cs.AI:This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.
cs.AI:In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms.
cs.AI:In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise.
cs.AI:This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions.
cs.AI:One of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up problem solvers is macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators. The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size.
cs.AI:We examine the computational complexity of testing and finding small plans in probabilistic planning domains with both flat and propositional representations. The complexity of plan evaluation and existence varies with the plan type sought; we examine totally ordered plans, acyclic plans, and looping plans, and partially ordered plans under three natural definitions of plan value. We show that problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: PL, P, NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE. In the process of proving that certain planning problems are complete for NP^PP, we introduce a new basic NP^PP-complete problem, E-MAJSAT, which generalizes the standard Boolean satisfiability problem to computations involving probabilistic quantities; our results suggest that the development of good heuristics for E-MAJSAT could be important for the creation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety of problems.
cs.AI:In this paper we describe SYNERGY, which is a highly parallelizable, linear planning system that is based on the genetic programming paradigm. Rather than reasoning about the world it is planning for, SYNERGY uses artificial selection, recombination and fitness measure to generate linear plans that solve conjunctive goals. We ran SYNERGY on several domains (e.g., the briefcase problem and a few variants of the robot navigation problem), and the experimental results show that our planner is capable of handling problem instances that are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the ones solved by UCPOP. In order to facilitate the search reduction and to enhance the expressive power of SYNERGY, we also propose two major extensions to our planning system: a formalism for using hierarchical planning operators, and a framework for planning in dynamic environments.
cs.AI:We show that several constraint propagation algorithms (also called (local) consistency, consistency enforcing, Waltz, filtering or narrowing algorithms) are instances of algorithms that deal with chaotic iteration. To this end we propose a simple abstract framework that allows us to classify and compare these algorithms and to establish in a uniform way their basic properties.
cs.AI:This paper examines the phenomenon of daydreaming: spontaneously recalling or imagining personal or vicarious experiences in the past or future. The following important roles of daydreaming in human cognition are postulated: plan preparation and rehearsal, learning from failures and successes, support for processes of creativity, emotion regulation, and motivation.   A computational theory of daydreaming and its implementation as the program DAYDREAMER are presented. DAYDREAMER consists of 1) a scenario generator based on relaxed planning, 2) a dynamic episodic memory of experiences used by the scenario generator, 3) a collection of personal goals and control goals which guide the scenario generator, 4) an emotion component in which daydreams initiate, and are initiated by, emotional states arising from goal outcomes, and 5) domain knowledge of interpersonal relations and common everyday occurrences.   The role of emotions and control goals in daydreaming is discussed. Four control goals commonly used in guiding daydreaming are presented: rationalization, failure/success reversal, revenge, and preparation. The role of episodic memory in daydreaming is considered, including how daydreamed information is incorporated into memory and later used. An initial version of DAYDREAMER which produces several daydreams (in English) is currently running.
cs.AI:Real world combinatorial optimization problems such as scheduling are typically too complex to solve with exact methods. Additionally, the problems often have to observe vaguely specified constraints of different importance, the available data may be uncertain, and compromises between antagonistic criteria may be necessary. We present a combination of approximate reasoning based constraints and iterative optimization based heuristics that help to model and solve such problems in a framework of C++ software libraries called StarFLIP++. While initially developed to schedule continuous caster units in steel plants, we present in this paper results from reusing the library components in a shift scheduling system for the workforce of an industrial production plant.
cs.AI:The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern, 1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including revision and update.
cs.AI:How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) "iconic representations," which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) "categorical representations," which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) "symbolic representations," grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., "An X is a Y that is Z").
cs.AI:In tree search problem the best-first search algorithm needs too much of space . To remove such drawbacks of these algorithms the IDA* was developed which is both space and time cost efficient. But again IDA* can give an optimal solution for real valued problems like Flow shop scheduling, Travelling Salesman and 0/1 Knapsack due to their real valued cost estimates. Thus further modifications are done on it and the Iterative Deepening Branch and Bound Search Algorithms is developed which meets the requirements. We have tried using this algorithm for the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem and have found that it is quite effective.
cs.AI:Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in their environment or ``state.'' Over the last few years, there have been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd Pick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \emph{probabilistic agent program} and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics, though more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide sound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \emph{positive} agent programs.
cs.AI:The assumptions needed to prove Cox's Theorem are discussed and examined. Various sets of assumptions under which a Cox-style theorem can be proved are provided, although all are rather strong and, arguably, not natural.
cs.AI:We revisit the issue of connections between two leading formalisms in nonmonotonic reasoning: autoepistemic logic and default logic. For each logic we develop a comprehensive semantic framework based on the notion of a belief pair. The set of all belief pairs together with the so called knowledge ordering forms a complete lattice. For each logic, we introduce several semantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs. Our results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic constructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as modal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic. Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate, the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result explains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two semantics. In the paper, we also discuss approximating skeptical reasoning with autoepistemic and default logics and establish constructive principles behind such approximations.
cs.AI:Randomized algorithms for deciding satisfiability were shown to be effective in solving problems with thousands of variables. However, these algorithms are not complete. That is, they provide no guarantee that a satisfying assignment, if one exists, will be found. Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there are two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time and, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a satisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue that without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for randomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use both notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate the dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as clause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We demonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of variables of the input formula for randomly generated 3-CNF formulas and for the formulas encoding 3- and 4-colorability of graphs.
cs.AI:Two different types of agency are discussed based on dynamically coherent and incoherent couplings with an environment respectively. I propose that until a private syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent agents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy. When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of description-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled. At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from dynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent computation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed. RNA editing is also mentioned as a process that may have been used to obtain a primordial biological code necessary open-ended evolution.
cs.AI:This paper presents a method of computing a revision of a function-free normal logic program. If an added rule is inconsistent with a program, that is, if it leads to a situation such that no stable model exists for a new program, then deletion and addition of rules are performed to avoid inconsistency. We specify a revision by translating a normal logic program into an abductive logic program with abducibles to represent deletion and addition of rules. To compute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down abductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule. We compute a minimally revised program, by choosing a minimal set of abducibles among all the sets of abducibles computed by a top-down proof procedure.
cs.AI:This is a system description for the OSCAR defeasible reasoner.
cs.AI:Diagnostic reasoning has been characterized logically as consistency-based reasoning or abductive reasoning. Previous analyses in the literature have shown, on the one hand, that choosing the (in general more restrictive) abductive definition may be appropriate or not, depending on the content of the knowledge base [Console&Torasso91], and, on the other hand, that, depending on the choice of the definition the same knowledge should be expressed in different form [Poole94].   Since in Model-Based Diagnosis a major problem is finding the right way of abstracting the behavior of the system to be modeled, this paper discusses the relation between modeling, and in particular abstraction in the model, and the notion of diagnosis.
cs.AI:ACLP is a system which combines abductive reasoning and constraint solving by integrating the frameworks of Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). It forms a general high-level knowledge representation environment for abductive problems in Artificial Intelligence and other areas. In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving facilitating its application to complex problems. The ACLP system is currently implemented on top of the CLP language of ECLiPSe as a meta-interpreter exploiting its underlying constraint solver for finite domains. It has been applied to the problems of planning and scheduling in order to test its computational effectiveness compared with the direct use of the (lower level) constraint solving framework of CLP on which it is built. These experiments provide evidence that the abductive framework of ACLP does not compromise significantly the computational efficiency of the solutions. Other experiments show the natural ability of ACLP to accommodate easily and in a robust way new or changing requirements of the original problem.
cs.AI:We present a method for relevance sensitive non-monotonic inference from belief sequences which incorporates insights pertaining to prioritized inference and relevance sensitive, inconsistency tolerant belief revision.   Our model uses a finite, logically open sequence of propositional formulas as a representation for beliefs and defines a notion of inference from maxiconsistent subsets of formulas guided by two orderings: a temporal sequencing and an ordering based on relevance relations between the conclusion and formulas in the sequence. The relevance relations are ternary (using context as a parameter) as opposed to standard binary axiomatizations. The inference operation thus defined easily handles iterated revision by maintaining a revision history, blocks the derivation of inconsistent answers from a possibly inconsistent sequence and maintains the distinction between explicit and implicit beliefs. In doing so, it provides a finitely presented formalism and a plausible model of reasoning for automated agents.
cs.AI:We propose a combination of probabilistic reasoning from conditional constraints with approaches to default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. In detail, we generalize the notions of Pearl's entailment in system Z, Lehmann's lexicographic entailment, and Geffner's conditional entailment to conditional constraints. We give some examples that show that the new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment have similar properties like their classical counterparts. Moreover, we show that the new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment are proper generalizations of both their classical counterparts and the classical notion of logical entailment for conditional constraints.
cs.AI:This paper describes a system, called PLP, for compiling ordered logic programs into standard logic programs under the answer set semantics. In an ordered logic program, rules are named by unique terms, and preferences among rules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Since the result of the translation is an extended logic program, existing logic programming systems can be used as underlying reasoning engine. In particular, PLP is conceived as a front-end to the logic programming systems dlv and smodels.
cs.AI:The SLDNFA-system results from the LP+ project at the K.U.Leuven, which investigates logics and proof procedures for these logics for declarative knowledge representation. Within this project inductive definition logic (ID-logic) is used as representation logic. Different solvers are being developed for this logic and one of these is SLDNFA. A prototype of the system is available and used for investigating how to solve efficiently problems represented in ID-logic.
cs.AI:We describe an approach for compiling preferences into logic programs under the answer set semantics. An ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Our approach allows both the specification of static orderings (as found in most previous work), in which preferences are external to a logic program, as well as orderings on sets of rules. In large part then, we are interested in describing a general methodology for uniformly incorporating preference information in a logic program. Since the result of our translation is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a compiler, available on the web, as a front-end for these programming systems.
cs.AI:This paper proposes two kinds of fuzzy abductive inference in the framework of fuzzy rule base. The abductive inference processes described here depend on the semantic of the rule. We distinguish two classes of interpretation of a fuzzy rule, certainty generation rules and possible generation rules. In this paper we present the architecture of abductive inference in the first class of interpretation. We give two kinds of problem that we can resolve by using the proposed models of inference.
cs.AI:The goal of the LP+ project at the K.U.Leuven is to design an expressive logic, suitable for declarative knowledge representation, and to develop intelligent systems based on Logic Programming technology for solving computational problems using the declarative specifications. The ID-logic is an integration of typed classical logic and a definition logic. Different abductive solvers for this language are being developed. This paper is a report of the integration of high order aggregates into ID-logic and the consequences on the solver SLDNFA.
cs.AI:We propose a new approach to belief revision that provides a way to change knowledge bases with a minimum of effort. We call this way of revising belief states optimal belief revision. Our revision method gives special attention to the fact that most belief revision processes are directed to a specific informational objective. This approach to belief change is founded on notions such as optimal context and accessibility. For the sentential model of belief states we provide both a formal description of contexts as sub-theories determined by three parameters and a method to construct contexts. Next, we introduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for selecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort involved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we characterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility ordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking of an arbitrary sentence in the language. Finally, we define the adjustment of the accessibility ranking of a revised base of a belief set.
cs.AI:High-level robot controllers in realistic domains typically deal with processes which operate concurrently, change the world continuously, and where the execution of actions is event-driven as in ``charge the batteries as soon as the voltage level is low''. While non-logic-based robot control languages are well suited to express such scenarios, they fare poorly when it comes to projecting, in a conspicuous way, how the world evolves when actions are executed. On the other hand, a logic-based control language like \congolog, based on the situation calculus, is well-suited for the latter. However, it has problems expressing event-driven behavior. In this paper, we show how these problems can be overcome by first extending the situation calculus to support continuous change and event-driven behavior and then presenting \ccgolog, a variant of \congolog which is based on the extended situation calculus. One benefit of \ccgolog is that it narrows the gap in expressiveness compared to non-logic-based control languages while preserving a semantically well-founded projection mechanism.
cs.AI:The Smodels system implements the stable model semantics for normal logic programs. It handles a subclass of programs which contain no function symbols and are domain-restricted but supports extensions including built-in functions as well as cardinality and weight constraints. On top of this core engine more involved systems can be built. As an example, we have implemented total and partial stable model computation for disjunctive logic programs. An interesting application method is based on answer set programming, i.e., encoding an application problem as a set of rules so that its solutions are captured by the stable models of the rules. Smodels has been applied to a number of areas including planning, model checking, reachability analysis, product configuration, dynamic constraint satisfaction, and feature interaction.
cs.AI:E-RES is a system that implements the Language E, a logic for reasoning about narratives of action occurrences and observations. E's semantics is model-theoretic, but this implementation is based on a sound and complete reformulation of E in terms of argumentation, and uses general computational techniques of argumentation frameworks. The system derives sceptical non-monotonic consequences of a given reformulated theory which exactly correspond to consequences entailed by E's model-theory. The computation relies on a complimentary ability of the system to derive credulous non-monotonic consequences together with a set of supporting assumptions which is sufficient for the (credulous) conclusion to hold. E-RES allows theories to contain general action laws, statements about action occurrences, observations and statements of ramifications (or universal laws). It is able to derive consequences both forward and backward in time. This paper gives a short overview of the theoretical basis of E-RES and illustrates its use on a variety of examples. Currently, E-RES is being extended so that the system can be used for planning.
cs.AI:In this paper, we outline the prototype of an automated inference tool, called QUIP, which provides a uniform implementation for several nonmonotonic reasoning formalisms. The theoretical basis of QUIP is derived from well-known results about the computational complexity of nonmonotonic logics and exploits a representation of the different reasoning tasks in terms of quantified boolean formulae.
cs.AI:Over the past decade a considerable amount of research has been done to expand logic programming languages to handle incomplete information. One such language is the language of epistemic specifications. As is usual with logic programming languages, the problem of answering queries is intractable in the general case. For extended disjunctive logic programs, an idea that has proven useful in simplifying the investigation of answer sets is the use of splitting sets. In this paper we will present an extended definition of splitting sets that will be applicable to epistemic specifications. Furthermore, an extension of the splitting set theorem will be presented. Also, a characterization of stratified epistemic specifications will be given in terms of splitting sets. This characterization leads us to an algorithmic method of computing world views of a subclass of epistemic logic programs.
cs.AI:The US Data Encryption Standard, DES for short, is put forward as an interesting benchmark problem for nonmonotonic reasoning systems because (i) it provides a set of test cases of industrial relevance which shares features of randomly generated problems and real-world problems, (ii) the representation of DES using normal logic programs with the stable model semantics is simple and easy to understand, and (iii) this subclass of logic programs can be seen as an interesting special case for many other formalizations of nonmonotonic reasoning. In this paper we present two encodings of DES as logic programs: a direct one out of the standard specifications and an optimized one extending the work of Massacci and Marraro. The computational properties of the encodings are studied by using them for DES key search with the Smodels system as the implementation of the stable model semantics. Results indicate that the encodings and Smodels are quite competitive: they outperform state-of-the-art SAT-checkers working with an optimized encoding of DES into SAT and are comparable with a SAT-checker that is customized and tuned for the optimized SAT encoding.
cs.AI:We generalize a theorem by Francois Fages that describes the relationship between the completion semantics and the answer set semantics for logic programs with negation as failure. The study of this relationship is important in connection with the emergence of answer set programming. Whenever the two semantics are equivalent, answer sets can be computed by a satisfiability solver, and the use of answer set solvers such as smodels and dlv is unnecessary. A logic programming representation of the blocks world due to Ilkka Niemelae is discussed as an example.
cs.AI:We introduced decomposable negation normal form (DNNF) recently as a tractable form of propositional theories, and provided a number of powerful logical operations that can be performed on it in polynomial time. We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories.
cs.AI:The paper reports on first preliminary results and insights gained in a project aiming at implementing the fluent calculus using methods and techniques based on binary decision diagrams. After reporting on an initial experiment showing promising results we discuss our findings concerning various techniques and heuristics used to speed up the reasoning process.
cs.AI:Planning is a natural domain of application for frameworks of reasoning about actions and change. In this paper we study how one such framework, the Language E, can form the basis for planning under (possibly) incomplete information. We define two types of plans: weak and safe plans, and propose a planner, called the E-Planner, which is often able to extend an initial weak plan into a safe plan even though the (explicit) information available is incomplete, e.g. for cases where the initial state is not completely known. The E-Planner is based upon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural proof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this proof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts argumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We provide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in particular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known.
cs.AI:In an earlier work, we have presented operations of belief change which only affect the relevant part of a belief base. In this paper, we propose the application of the same strategy to the problem of model-based diangosis. We first isolate the subset of the system description which is relevant for a given observation and then solve the diagnosis problem for this subset.
cs.AI:We present a general, consistency-based framework for belief change. Informally, in revising K by A, we begin with A and incorporate as much of K as consistently possible. Formally, a knowledge base K and sentence A are expressed, via renaming propositions in K, in separate languages. Using a maximization process, we assume the languages are the same insofar as consistently possible. Lastly, we express the resultant knowledge base in a single language. There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended by K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'' represents the revised state; alternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.   The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express other approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and the incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework differs from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect to iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for implementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results than general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite knowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those propositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A.
cs.AI:SATEN is an object-oriented web-based extraction and belief revision engine. It runs on any computer via a Java 1.1 enabled browser such as Netscape 4. SATEN performs belief revision based on the AGM approach. The extraction and belief revision reasoning engines operate on a user specified ranking of information. One of the features of SATEN is that it can be used to integrate mutually inconsistent commensuate rankings into a consistent ranking.
cs.AI:Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming paradigm. We describe here an ASP system, DATALOG with constraints or DC, based on non-monotonic logic. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax, use and implementation of DC and provide experimental results.
cs.AI:Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming paradigm well attuned to search problems in AI, constraint satisfaction and combinatorics. Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with an intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints. However, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive closure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large theories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such problems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as stable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently and, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their semantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this paper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an implementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the effectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and SMODELS implementation of stable logic programming. Our results show that DC is competitive with the other two approaches, in case of many search problems, often yielding much more efficient solutions.
cs.AI:We study here the well-known propagation rules for Boolean constraints. First we propose a simple notion of completeness for sets of such rules and establish a completeness result. Then we show an equivalence in an appropriate sense between Boolean constraint propagation and unit propagation, a form of resolution for propositional logic.   Subsequently we characterize one set of such rules by means of the notion of hyper-arc consistency introduced in (Mohr and Masini 1988). Also, we clarify the status of a similar, though different, set of rules introduced in (Simonis 1989a) and more fully in (Codognet and Diaz 1996).
cs.AI:A general notion of algebraic conditional plausibility measures is defined. Probability measures, ranking functions, possibility measures, and (under the appropriate definitions) sets of probability measures can all be viewed as defining algebraic conditional plausibility measures. It is shown that algebraic conditional plausibility measures can be represented using Bayesian networks.
cs.AI:In this paper we present a rule based formalism for filtering variables domains of constraints. This formalism is well adapted for solving dynamic CSP. We take diagnosis as an instance problem to illustrate the use of these rules. A diagnosis problem is seen like finding all the minimal sets of constraints to be relaxed in the constraint network that models the device to be diagnosed
cs.AI:Despite the effort of many researchers in the area of multi-agent systems (MAS) for designing and programming agents, a few years ago the research community began to take into account that common features among different MAS exists. Based on these common features, several tools have tackled the problem of agent development on specific application domains or specific types of agents. As a consequence, their scope is restricted to a subset of the huge application domain of MAS. In this paper we propose a generic infrastructure for programming agents whose name is Brainstorm/J. The infrastructure has been implemented as an object oriented framework. As a consequence, our approach supports a broader scope of MAS applications than previous efforts, being flexible and reusable.
cs.AI:In fuzzy propositional logic, to a proposition a partial truth in [0,1] is assigned. It is well known that under certain circumstances, fuzzy logic collapses to classical logic. In this paper, we will show that under dual conditions, fuzzy logic collapses to four-valued (relevance) logic, where propositions have truth-value true, false, unknown, or contradiction. As a consequence, fuzzy entailment may be considered as ``in between'' four-valued (relevance) entailment and classical entailment.
cs.AI:We propose a new definition of actual cause, using structural equations to model counterfactuals. We show that the definition yields a plausible and elegant account of causation that handles well examples which have caused problems for other definitions and resolves major difficulties in the traditional account.
cs.AI:Many logic programming based approaches can be used to describe and solve combinatorial search problems. On the one hand there is constraint logic programming which computes a solution as an answer substitution to a query containing the variables of the constraint satisfaction problem. On the other hand there are systems based on stable model semantics, abductive systems, and first order logic model generators which compute solutions as models of some theory. This paper compares these different approaches from the point of view of knowledge representation (how declarative are the programs) and from the point of view of performance (how good are they at solving typical problems).
cs.AI:In this paper, we introduce a new machine learning theory based on multi-channel parallel adaptation for rule discovery. This theory is distinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of neural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We show how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a parallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing in that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model converges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model adaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on gradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local optimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is developed to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the CFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we prove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a critical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule learning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be extracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the practical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition and hepatitis prognosis prediction.
cs.AI:We present an approach for modelling the structure and coarse content of legal documents with a view to providing automated support for the drafting of contracts and contract database retrieval. The approach is designed to be applicable where contract drafting is based on model-form contracts or on existing examples of a similar type. The main features of the approach are: (1) the representation addresses the structure and the interrelationships between the constituent parts of contracts, but not the text of the document itself; (2) the representation of documents is separated from the mechanisms that manipulate it; and (3) the drafting process is subject to a collection of explicitly stated constraints that govern the structure of the documents. We describe the representation of document instances and of 'generic documents', which are data structures used to drive the creation of new document instances, and we show extracts from a sample session to illustrate the features of a prototype system implemented in MacProlog.
cs.AI:One influential approach to assessing the "goodness" of arguments is offered by the Pragma-Dialectical school (p-d) (Eemeren & Grootendorst 1992). This can be compared with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson 1988), an approach that originates in discourse analysis. In p-d terms an argument is good if it avoids committing a fallacy, whereas in RST terms an argument is good if it is coherent. RST has been criticised (Snoeck Henkemans 1997) for providing only a partially functional account of argument, and similar criticisms have been raised in the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community-particularly by Moore & Pollack (1992)- with regards to its account of intentionality in text in general. Mann and Thompson themselves note that although RST can be successfully applied to a wide range of texts from diverse domains, it fails to characterise some types of text, most notably legal contracts. There is ongoing research in the Artificial Intelligence and Law community exploring the potential for providing electronic support to contract negotiators, focusing on long-term, complex engineering agreements (see for example Daskalopulu & Sergot 1997). This paper provides a brief introduction to RST and illustrates its shortcomings with respect to contractual text. An alternative approach for modelling argument structure is presented which not only caters for contractual text, but also overcomes the aforementioned limitations of RST.
cs.AI:Information Integration is a young and exciting field with enormous research and commercial significance in the new world of the Information Society. It stands at the crossroad of Databases and Artificial Intelligence requiring novel techniques that bring together different methods from these fields. Information from disparate heterogeneous sources often with no a-priori common schema needs to be synthesized in a flexible, transparent and intelligent way in order to respond to the demands of a query thus enabling a more informed decision by the user or application program. The field although relatively young has already found many practical applications particularly for integrating information over the World Wide Web. This paper gives a brief introduction of the field highlighting some of the main current and future research issues and application areas. It attempts to evaluate the current and potential role of Computational Logic in this and suggests some of the problems where logic-based techniques could be used.
cs.AI:Constraint propagation is a general algorithmic approach for pruning the search space of a CSP. In a uniform way, K. R. Apt has defined a computation as an iteration of reduction functions over a domain. He has also demonstrated the need for integrating static properties of reduction functions (commutativity and semi-commutativity) to design specialized algorithms such as AC3 and DAC. We introduce here a set of operators for modeling compositions of reduction functions. Two of the major goals are to tackle parallel computations, and dynamic behaviours (such as slow convergence).
cs.AI:We consider an approach to update nonmonotonic knowledge bases represented as extended logic programs under answer set semantics. New information is incorporated into the current knowledge base subject to a causal rejection principle enforcing that, in case of conflicts, more recent rules are preferred and older rules are overridden. Such a rejection principle is also exploited in other approaches to update logic programs, e.g., in dynamic logic programming by Alferes et al. We give a thorough analysis of properties of our approach, to get a better understanding of the causal rejection principle. We review postulates for update and revision operators from the area of theory change and nonmonotonic reasoning, and some new properties are considered as well. We then consider refinements of our semantics which incorporate a notion of minimality of change. As well, we investigate the relationship to other approaches, showing that our approach is semantically equivalent to inheritance programs by Buccafurri et al. and that it coincides with certain classes of dynamic logic programs, for which we provide characterizations in terms of graph conditions. Therefore, most of our results about properties of causal rejection principle apply to these approaches as well. Finally, we deal with computational complexity of our approach, and outline how the update semantics and its refinements can be implemented on top of existing logic programming engines.
cs.AI:We introduce a learning method called ``gradient-based reinforcement planning'' (GREP). Unlike traditional DP methods that improve their policy backwards in time, GREP is a gradient-based method that plans ahead and improves its policy before it actually acts in the environment. We derive formulas for the exact policy gradient that maximizes the expected future reward and confirm our ideas with numerical experiments.
cs.AI:Much work in computer science has adopted competitive analysis as a tool for decision making under uncertainty. In this work we extend competitive analysis to the context of multi-agent systems. Unlike classical competitive analysis where the behavior of an agent's environment is taken to be arbitrary, we consider the case where an agent's environment consists of other agents. These agents will usually obey some (minimal) rationality constraints. This leads to the definition of rational competitive analysis. We introduce the concept of rational competitive analysis, and initiate the study of competitive analysis for multi-agent systems. We also discuss the application of rational competitive analysis to the context of bidding games, as well as to the classical one-way trading problem.
cs.AI:This article aims at clarifying the language and practice of scientific experiment, mainly by hooking observability on calculability.
cs.AI:Many systems that exhibit nonmonotonic behavior have been described and studied already in the literature. The general notion of nonmonotonic reasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D. Gabbay, while the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in. Five such families are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams. The "preferential" models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic. The extension of our results to first order predicate calculi and the study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in this paper will be treated in another paper.
cs.AI:This paper presents a logical approach to nonmonotonic reasoning based on the notion of a nonmonotonic consequence relation. A conditional knowledge base, consisting of a set of conditional assertions of the type "if ... then ...", represents the explicit defeasible knowledge an agent has about the way the world generally behaves. We look for a plausible definition of the set of all conditional assertions entailed by a conditional knowledge base. In a previous paper, S. Kraus and the authors defined and studied "preferential" consequence relations. They noticed that not all preferential relations could be considered as reasonable inference procedures. This paper studies a more restricted class of consequence relations, "rational" relations. It is argued that any reasonable nonmonotonic inference procedure should define a rational relation. It is shown that the rational relations are exactly those that may be represented by a "ranked" preferential model, or by a (non-standard) probabilistic model. The rational closure of a conditional knowledge base is defined and shown to provide an attractive answer to the question of the title. Global properties of this closure operation are proved: it is a cumulative operation. It is also computationally tractable. This paper assumes the underlying language is propositional.
cs.AI:It is shown that Darwiche and Pearl's postulates imply an interesting property, not noticed by the authors.
cs.AI:A vast and interesting family of natural semantics for belief revision is defined. Suppose one is given a distance d between any two models. One may then define the revision of a theory K by a formula a as the theory defined by the set of all those models of a that are closest, by d, to the set of models of K. This family is characterized by a set of rationality postulates that extends the AGM postulates. The new postulates describe properties of iterated revisions.
cs.AI:We give a semantics to iterated update by a preference relation on possible developments. An iterated update is a sequence of formulas, giving (incomplete) information about successive states of the world. A development is a sequence of models, describing a possible trajectory through time. We assume a principle of inertia and prefer those developments, which are compatible with the information, and avoid unnecessary changes. The logical properties of the updates defined in this way are considered, and a representation result is proved.
cs.AI:A. Tarski proposed the study of infinitary consequence operations as the central topic of mathematical logic. He considered monotonicity to be a property of all such operations. In this paper, we weaken the monotonicity requirement and consider more general operations, inference operations. These operations describe the nonmonotonic logics both humans and machines seem to be using when infering defeasible information from incomplete knowledge. We single out a number of interesting families of inference operations. This study of infinitary inference operations is inspired by the results of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor on finitary nonmonotonic operations, but this paper is self-contained.
cs.AI:The Expansion property considered by researchers in Social Choice is shown to correspond to a logical property of nonmonotonic consequence relations that is the {\em pure}, i.e., not involving connectives, version of a previously known weak rationality condition. The assumption that the union of two definable sets of models is definable is needed for the soundness part of the result.
cs.AI:The lexicographic closure of any given finite set D of normal defaults is defined. A conditional assertion "if a then b" is in this lexicographic closure if, given the defaults D and the fact a, one would conclude b. The lexicographic closure is essentially a rational extension of D, and of its rational closure, defined in a previous paper. It provides a logic of normal defaults that is different from the one proposed by R. Reiter and that is rich enough not to require the consideration of non-normal defaults. A large number of examples are provided to show that the lexicographic closure corresponds to the basic intuitions behind Reiter's logic of defaults.
cs.AI:We provide a characterization of those nonmonotonic inference operations C for which C(X) may be described as the set of all logical consequences of X together with some set of additional assumptions S(X) that depends anti-monotonically on X (i.e., X is a subset of Y implies that S(Y) is a subset of S(X)). The operations represented are exactly characterized in terms of properties most of which have been studied in Freund-Lehmann(cs.AI/0202031). Similar characterizations of right-absorbing and cumulative operations are also provided. For cumulative operations, our results fit in closely with those of Freund. We then discuss extending finitary operations to infinitary operations in a canonical way and discuss co-compactness properties. Our results provide a satisfactory notion of pseudo-compactness, generalizing to deductive nonmonotonic operations the notion of compactness for monotonic operations. They also provide an alternative, more elegant and more general, proof of the existence of an infinitary deductive extension for any finitary deductive operation (Theorem 7.9 of Freund-Lehmann).
cs.AI:Stereotypical reasoning assumes that the situation at hand is one of a kind and that it enjoys the properties generally associated with that kind of situation. It is one of the most basic forms of nonmonotonic reasoning. A formal model for stereotypical reasoning is proposed and the logical properties of this form of reasoning are studied. Stereotypical reasoning is shown to be cumulative under weak assumptions.
cs.AI:We introduce a methodology and framework for expressing general preference information in logic programming under the answer set semantics. An ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form s < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler as a front-end for these programming systems.
cs.AI:Prioritized default reasoning has illustrated its rich expressiveness and flexibility in knowledge representation and reasoning. However, many important aspects of prioritized default reasoning have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we investigate two properties of prioritized logic programs in the context of answer set semantics. Specifically, we reveal a close relationship between mutual defeasibility and uniqueness of the answer set for a prioritized logic program. We then explore how the splitting technique for extended logic programs can be extended to prioritized logic programs. We prove splitting theorems that can be used to simplify the evaluation of a prioritized logic program under certain conditions.
cs.AI:The (extended) AGM postulates for belief revision seem to deal with the revision of a given theory K by an arbitrary formula, but not to constrain the revisions of two different theories by the same formula. A new postulate is proposed and compared with other similar postulates that have been proposed in the literature. The AGM revisions that satisfy this new postulate stand in one-to-one correspondence with the rational, consistency-preserving relations. This correspondence is described explicitly. Two viewpoints on iterative revisions are distinguished and discussed.
cs.AI:We study fixpoints of operators on lattices. To this end we introduce the notion of an approximation of an operator. We order approximations by means of a precision ordering. We show that each lattice operator O has a unique most precise or ultimate approximation. We demonstrate that fixpoints of this ultimate approximation provide useful insights into fixpoints of the operator O.   We apply our theory to logic programming and introduce the ultimate Kripke-Kleene, well-founded and stable semantics. We show that the ultimate Kripke-Kleene and well-founded semantics are more precise then their standard counterparts We argue that ultimate semantics for logic programming have attractive epistemological properties and that, while in general they are computationally more complex than the standard semantics, for many classes of theories, their complexity is no worse.
cs.AI:Representing defeasibility is an important issue in common sense reasoning. In reasoning about action and change, this issue becomes more difficult because domain and action related defeasible information may conflict with general inertia rules. Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also interfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a prioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning about action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\cal AT}^{0}, {\cal AT}^{1} and {\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in action domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and actions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a higher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower superscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\cal A} language but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where transition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By illustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a powerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and postdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action languages and characterize classes of action domains that present more desirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action languages.
cs.AI:An anticipatory system for guiding plot development in interactive narratives is described. The executable model is a finite automaton that provides the implemented system with a look-ahead. The identification of undesirable future states in the model is used to guide the player, in a transparent manner. In this way, too radical twists of the plot can be avoided. Since the player participates in the development of the plot, such guidance can have many forms, depending on the environment of the player, on the behavior of the other players, and on the means of player interaction. We present a design method for interactive narratives which produces designs suitable for the implementation of anticipatory mechanisms. Use of the method is illustrated by application to our interactive computer game Kaktus.
cs.AI:Open logic programs and open entailment have been recently proposed as an abstract framework for the verification of incomplete specifications based upon normal logic programs and the stable model semantics. There are obvious analogies between open predicates and abducible predicates. However, despite superficial similarities, there are features of open programs that have no immediate counterpart in the framework of abduction and viceversa. Similarly, open programs cannot be immediately simulated with answer set programming (ASP). In this paper we start a thorough investigation of the relationships between open inference, abduction and ASP. We shall prove that open programs generalize the other two frameworks. The generalized framework suggests interesting extensions of abduction under the generalized stable model semantics. In some cases, we will be able to reduce open inference to abduction and ASP, thereby estimating its computational complexity. At the same time, the aforementioned reduction opens the way to new applications of abduction and ASP.
cs.AI:In this paper we consider three different kinds of domain-dependent control knowledge (temporal, procedural and HTN-based) that are useful in planning. Our approach is declarative and relies on the language of logic programming with answer set semantics (AnsProlog*). AnsProlog* is designed to plan without control knowledge. We show how temporal, procedural and HTN-based control knowledge can be incorporated into AnsProlog* by the modular addition of a small number of domain-dependent rules, without the need to modify the planner. We formally prove the correctness of our planner, both in the absence and presence of the control knowledge. Finally, we perform some initial experimentation that demonstrates the potential reduction in planning time that can be achieved when procedural domain knowledge is used to solve planning problems with large plan length.
cs.AI:Dung's abstract framework for argumentation enables a study of the interactions between arguments based solely on an ``attack'' binary relation on the set of arguments. Various ways to solve conflicts between contradictory pieces of information have been proposed in the context of argumentation, nonmonotonic reasoning or logic programming, and can be captured by appropriate semantics within Dung's framework. A common feature of these semantics is that one can always maximize in some sense the set of acceptable arguments. We propose in this paper to extend Dung's framework in order to allow for the representation of what we call ``restricted'' arguments: these arguments should only be used if absolutely necessary, that is, in order to support other arguments that would otherwise be defeated. We modify Dung's preferred semantics accordingly: a set of arguments becomes acceptable only if it contains a minimum of restricted arguments, for a maximum of unrestricted arguments.
cs.AI:We address a general representation problem for belief change, and describe two interrelated representations for iterative non-prioritized change: a logical representation in terms of persistent epistemic states, and a constructive representation in terms of flocks of bases.
cs.AI:An extension of an abstract argumentation framework, called collective argumentation, is introduced in which the attack relation is defined directly among sets of arguments. The extension turns out to be suitable, in particular, for representing semantics of disjunctive logic programs. Two special kinds of collective argumentation are considered in which the opponents can share their arguments.
cs.AI:Logic programs with ordered disjunction (LPODs) combine ideas underlying Qualitative Choice Logic (Brewka et al. KR 2002) and answer set programming. Logic programming under answer set semantics is extended with a new connective called ordered disjunction. The new connective allows us to represent alternative, ranked options for problem solutions in the heads of rules: A \times B intuitively means: if possible A, but if A is not possible then at least B. The semantics of logic programs with ordered disjunction is based on a preference relation on answer sets. LPODs are useful for applications in design and configuration and can serve as a basis for qualitative decision making.
cs.AI:In this paper, we investigate the extent to which knowledge compilation can be used to improve inference from propositional weighted bases. We present a general notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any equivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive results are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified, showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time polynomial in the output size. Finally, we sketch how our results can be used in model-based diagnosis in order to compute the most probable diagnoses of a system.
cs.AI:This paper studies the problem of modeling complex domains of actions and change within high-level action description languages. We investigate two main issues of concern: (a) can we represent complex domains that capture together different problems such as ramifications, non-determinism and concurrency of actions, at a high-level, close to the given natural ontology of the problem domain and (b) what features of such a representation can affect, and how, its computational behaviour. The paper describes the main problems faced in this representation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological guidelines for representing complex domains. Although our work has been carried out within one particular high-level description language, we believe that the results, especially those that relate to the problems of representation, are independent of the specific modeling language.
cs.AI:This paper introduces the notion of value-based argumentation frameworks, an extension of the standard argumentation frameworks proposed by Dung, which are able toshow how rational decision is possible in cases where arguments derive their force from the social values their acceptance would promote.
cs.AI:We analyze the problem of defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic programs within a general framework based on alternating fixpoint theory. We start by showing that generalizations of existing answer set approaches to preference are too weak in the setting of well-founded semantics. We then specify some informal yet intuitive criteria and propose a semantical framework for preference handling that is more suitable for defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic programs. The suitability of the new approach is convinced by the fact that many attractive properties are satisfied by our semantics. In particular, our semantics is still correct with respect to various existing answer sets semantics while it successfully overcomes the weakness of their generalization to well-founded semantics. Finally, we indicate how an existing preferred well-founded semantics can be captured within our semantical framework.
cs.AI:In this paper we present a transformation of finite propositional default theories into so-called propositional argumentation systems. This transformation allows to characterize all notions of Reiter's default logic in the framework of argumentation systems. As a consequence, computing extensions, or determining wether a given formula belongs to one extension or all extensions can be answered without leaving the field of classical propositional logic. The transformation proposed is linear in the number of defaults.
cs.AI:In the present paper, the existence and multiplicity problems of extensions are addressed. The focus is on extension of the stable type. The main result of the paper is an elegant characterization of the existence and multiplicity of extensions in terms of the notion of dialectical justification, a close cousin of the notion of admissibility. The characterization is given in the context of the particular logic for dialectical argumentation DEFLOG. The results are of direct relevance for several well-established models of defeasible reasoning (like default logic, logic programming and argumentation frameworks), since elsewhere dialectical argumentation has been shown to have close formal connections with these models.
cs.AI:Recently, it has been shown that probabilistic entailment under coherence is weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment. Moreover, probabilistic entailment under coherence is a generalization of default entailment in System P. In this paper, we continue this line of research by presenting probabilistic generalizations of more sophisticated notions of classical default entailment that lie between model-theoretic probabilistic entailment and probabilistic entailment under coherence. That is, the new formalisms properly generalize their counterparts in classical default reasoning, they are weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment, and they are stronger than probabilistic entailment under coherence. The new formalisms are useful especially for handling probabilistic inconsistencies related to conditioning on zero events. They can also be applied for probabilistic belief revision. More generally, in the same spirit as a similar previous paper, this paper sheds light on exciting new formalisms for probabilistic reasoning beyond the well-known standard ones.
cs.AI:We seek to find normative criteria of adequacy for nonmonotonic logic similar to the criterion of validity for deductive logic. Rather than stipulating that the conclusion of an inference be true in all models in which the premises are true, we require that the conclusion of a nonmonotonic inference be true in ``almost all'' models of a certain sort in which the premises are true. This ``certain sort'' specification picks out the models that are relevant to the inference, taking into account factors such as specificity and vagueness, and previous inferences. The frequencies characterizing the relevant models reflect known frequencies in our actual world. The criteria of adequacy for a default inference can be extended by thresholding to criteria of adequacy for an extension. We show that this avoids the implausibilities that might otherwise result from the chaining of default inferences. The model proportions, when construed in terms of frequencies, provide a verifiable grounding of default rules, and can become the basis for generating default rules from statistics.
cs.AI:About ten years ago, various notions of preferential entailment have been introduced. The main reference is a paper by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor (KLM), one of the main competitor being a more general version defined by Makinson (MAK). These two versions have already been compared, but it is time to revisit these comparisons. Here are our three main results: (1) These two notions are equivalent, provided that we restrict our attention, as done in KLM, to the cases where the entailment respects logical equivalence (on the left and on the right). (2) A serious simplification of the description of the fundamental cases in which MAK is equivalent to KLM, including a natural passage in both ways. (3) The two previous results are given for preferential entailments more general than considered in some of the original texts, but they apply also to the original definitions and, for this particular case also, the models can be simplified.
cs.AI:This work analyses main features that should be present in knowledge representation. It suggests a model for representation and a way to implement this model in software. Representation takes care of both low-level sensor information and high-level concepts.
cs.AI:We propose new definitions of (causal) explanation, using structural equations to model counterfactuals. The definition is based on the notion of actual cause, as defined and motivated in a companion paper. Essentially, an explanation is a fact that is not known for certain but, if found to be true, would constitute an actual cause of the fact to be explained, regardless of the agent's initial uncertainty. We show that the definition handles well a number of problematic examples from the literature.
cs.AI:Recently, several approaches to updating knowledge bases modeled as extended logic programs have been introduced, ranging from basic methods to incorporate (sequences of) sets of rules into a logic program, to more elaborate methods which use an update policy for specifying how updates must be incorporated. In this paper, we introduce a framework for reasoning about evolving knowledge bases, which are represented as extended logic programs and maintained by an update policy. We first describe a formal model which captures various update approaches, and we define a logical language for expressing properties of evolving knowledge bases. We then investigate semantical and computational properties of our framework, where we focus on properties of knowledge states with respect to the canonical reasoning task of whether a given formula holds on a given evolving knowledge base. In particular, we present finitary characterizations of the evolution for certain classes of framework instances, which can be exploited for obtaining decidability results. In more detail, we characterize the complexity of reasoning for some meaningful classes of evolving knowledge bases, ranging from polynomial to double exponential space complexity.
cs.AI:In this thesis I present a virtual laboratory which implements five different models for controlling animats: a rule-based system, a behaviour-based system, a concept-based system, a neural network, and a Braitenberg architecture. Through different experiments, I compare the performance of the models and conclude that there is no "best" model, since different models are better for different things in different contexts.   The models I chose, although quite simple, represent different approaches for studying cognition. Using the results as an empirical philosophical aid,   I note that there is no "best" approach for studying cognition, since different approaches have all advantages and disadvantages, because they study different aspects of cognition from different contexts. This has implications for current debates on "proper" approaches for cognition: all approaches are a bit proper, but none will be "proper enough". I draw remarks on the notion of cognition abstracting from all the approaches used to study it, and propose a simple classification for different types of cognition.
cs.AI:This paper deals with the revision of partially ordered beliefs. It proposes a semantic representation of epistemic states by partial pre-orders on interpretations and a syntactic representation by partially ordered belief bases. Two revision operations, the revision stemming from the history of observations and the possibilistic revision, defined when the epistemic state is represented by a total pre-order, are generalized, at a semantic level, to the case of a partial pre-order on interpretations, and at a syntactic level, to the case of a partially ordered belief base. The equivalence between the two representations is shown for the two revision operations.
cs.AI:This is the first in a series of connected papers discussing the problem of a dynamically reconfigurable universal learning neurocomputer that could serve as a computational model for the whole human brain. The whole series is entitled "The Brain Zero Project. My Brain as a Dynamically Reconfigurable Universal Learning Neurocomputer." (For more information visit the website www.brain0.com.) This introductory paper is concerned with general methodology. Its main goal is to explain why it is critically important for both neural modeling and cognitive modeling to pay much attention to the basic requirements of the whole brain as a complex computing system. The author argues that it can be easier to develop an adequate computational model for the whole "unprogrammed" (untrained) human brain than to find adequate formal representations of some nontrivial parts of brain's performance. (In the same way as, for example, it is easier to describe the behavior of a complex analytical function than the behavior of its real and/or imaginary part.) The "curse of dimensionality" that plagues purely phenomenological ("brainless") cognitive theories is a natural penalty for an attempt to represent insufficiently large parts of brain's performance in a state space of insufficiently high dimensionality. A "partial" modeler encounters "Catch 22." An attempt to simplify a cognitive problem by artificially reducing its dimensionality makes the problem more difficult.
cs.AI:As a part of our effort for studying the evolution and development of cognition, we present results derived from synthetic experimentations in a virtual laboratory where animats develop koncepts adaptively and ground their meaning through action. We introduce the term "koncept" to avoid confusions and ambiguity derived from the wide use of the word "concept". We present the models which our animats use for abstracting koncepts from perceptions, plastically adapt koncepts, and associate koncepts with actions. On a more philosophical vein, we suggest that knowledge is a property of a cognitive system, not an element, and therefore observer-dependent.
cs.AI:This paper presents a model for dynamic adjustment of the motivation degree, using a reinforcement learning approach, in an action selection mechanism previously developed by the authors. The learning takes place in the modification of a parameter of the model of combination of internal and external stimuli. Experiments that show the claimed properties are presented, using a VR simulation developed for such purposes. The importance of adaptation by learning in action selection is also discussed.
cs.AI:This article analyses the properties of the Internal Behaviour network, an action selection mechanism previously proposed by the authors, with the aid of a simulation developed for such ends. A brief review of the Internal Behaviour network is followed by the explanation of the implementation of the simulation. Then, experiments are presented and discussed analysing the properties of the action selection in the proposed model.
cs.AI:This paper proposes a model for combination of external and internal stimuli for the action selection in an autonomous agent, based in an action selection mechanism previously proposed by the authors. This combination model includes additive and multiplicative elements, which allows to incorporate new properties, which enhance the action selection. A given parameter a, which is part of the proposed model, allows to regulate the degree of dependence of the observed external behaviour from the internal states of the entity.
cs.AI:Reinforcement learning (RL) involves sequential decision making in uncertain environments. The aim of the decision-making agent is to maximize the benefit of acting in its environment over an extended period of time. Finding an optimal policy in RL may be very slow. To speed up learning, one often used solution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton's Dyna algorithm, or various other methods using macro-actions.   Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of the world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement learning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple model, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model makes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an optimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal. In turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables fast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations.
cs.AI:Optimization of decision problems in stochastic environments is usually concerned with maximizing the probability of achieving the goal and minimizing the expected episode length. For interacting agents in time-critical applications, learning of the possibility of scheduling of subtasks (events) or the full task is an additional relevant issue. Besides, there exist highly stochastic problems where the actual trajectories show great variety from episode to episode, but completing the task takes almost the same amount of time. The identification of sub-problems of this nature may promote e.g., planning, scheduling and segmenting Markov decision processes. In this work, formulae for the average duration as well as the standard deviation of the duration of events are derived. The emerging Bellman-type equation is a simple extension of Sobel's work (1982). Methods of dynamic programming as well as methods of reinforcement learning can be applied for our extension. Computer demonstration on a toy problem serve to highlight the principle.
cs.AI:Much work has been done on extending the well-founded semantics to general disjunctive logic programs and various approaches have been proposed. However, these semantics are different from each other and no consensus is reached about which semantics is the most intended. In this paper we look at disjunctive well-founded reasoning from different angles. We show that there is an intuitive form of the well-founded reasoning in disjunctive logic programming which can be characterized by slightly modifying some exisitng approaches to defining disjunctive well-founded semantics, including program transformations, argumentation, unfounded sets (and resolution-like procedure). We also provide a bottom-up procedure for this semantics. The significance of our work is not only in clarifying the relationship among different approaches, but also shed some light on what is an intended well-founded semantics for disjunctive logic programs.
cs.AI:We provide a semantic framework for preference handling in answer set programming. To this end, we introduce preference preserving consequence operators. The resulting fixpoint characterizations provide us with a uniform semantic framework for characterizing preference handling in existing approaches. Although our approach is extensible to other semantics by means of an alternating fixpoint theory, we focus here on the elaboration of preferences under answer set semantics. Alternatively, we show how these approaches can be characterized by the concept of order preservation. These uniform semantic characterizations provide us with new insights about interrelationships and moreover about ways of implementation.
cs.AI:The work reported here introduces Defeasible Logic Programming (DeLP), a formalism that combines results of Logic Programming and Defeasible Argumentation. DeLP provides the possibility of representing information in the form of weak rules in a declarative manner, and a defeasible argumentation inference mechanism for warranting the entailed conclusions.   In DeLP an argumentation formalism will be used for deciding between contradictory goals. Queries will be supported by arguments that could be defeated by other arguments. A query q will succeed when there is an argument A for q that is warranted, ie, the argument A that supports q is found undefeated by a warrant procedure that implements a dialectical analysis.   The defeasible argumentation basis of DeLP allows to build applications that deal with incomplete and contradictory information in dynamic domains. Thus, the resulting approach is suitable for representing agent's knowledge and for providing an argumentation based reasoning mechanism to agents.
cs.AI:Cooperative constraint solving is an area of constraint programming that studies the interaction between constraint solvers with the aim of discovering the interaction patterns that amplify the positive qualities of individual solvers. Automatisation and formalisation of such studies is an important issue of cooperative constraint solving.   In this paper we present a constraint-based analysis of composite solvers that integrates reasoning about the individual solvers and the processed data. The idea is to approximate this reasoning by resolution of set constraints on the finite sets representing the predicates that express all the necessary properties. We illustrate application of our analysis to two important cooperation patterns: deterministic choice and loop.
cs.AI:There is a growing interest in using Kalman-filter models for brain modelling. In turn, it is of considerable importance to represent Kalman-filter in connectionist forms with local Hebbian learning rules. To our best knowledge, Kalman-filter has not been given such local representation. It seems that the main obstacle is the dynamic adaptation of the Kalman-gain. Here, a connectionist representation is presented, which is derived by means of the recursive prediction error method. We show that this method gives rise to attractive local learning rules and can adapt the Kalman-gain.
cs.AI:We discuss philosophical issues concerning the notion of cognition basing ourselves in experimental results in cognitive sciences, especially in computer simulations of cognitive systems. There have been debates on the "proper" approach for studying cognition, but we have realized that all approaches can be in theory equivalent. Different approaches model different properties of cognitive systems from different perspectives, so we can only learn from all of them. We also integrate ideas from several perspectives for enhancing the notion of cognition, such that it can contain other definitions of cognition as special cases. This allows us to propose a simple classification of different types of cognition.
cs.AI:The paper studies an implementation methodology for partial and disjunctive stable models where partiality and disjunctions are unfolded from a logic program so that an implementation of stable models for normal (disjunction-free) programs can be used as the core inference engine. The unfolding is done in two separate steps. Firstly, it is shown that partial stable models can be captured by total stable models using a simple linear and modular program transformation. Hence, reasoning tasks concerning partial stable models can be solved using an implementation of total stable models. Disjunctive partial stable models have been lacking implementations which now become available as the translation handles also the disjunctive case. Secondly, it is shown how total stable models of disjunctive programs can be determined by computing stable models for normal programs. Hence, an implementation of stable models of normal programs can be used as a core engine for implementing disjunctive programs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by constructing a system for computing stable models of disjunctive programs using the smodels system as the core engine. The performance of the resulting system is compared to that of dlv which is a state-of-the-art special purpose system for disjunctive programs.
cs.AI:When tracking a large number of targets, it is often computationally expensive to represent the full joint distribution over target states. In cases where the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a separate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem. Another approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track only the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis density (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the expected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is kept, the model-data association problem is avoided.   The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD filter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of multiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show that the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving near-real-time performance.
cs.AI:Search in cyclic AND/OR graphs was traditionally known to be an unsolved problem. In the recent past several important studies have been reported in this domain. In this paper, we have taken a fresh look at the problem. First, a new and comprehensive theoretical framework for cyclic AND/OR graphs has been presented, which was found missing in the recent literature. Based on this framework, two best-first search algorithms, S1 and S2, have been developed. S1 does uninformed search and is a simple modification of the Bottom-up algorithm by Martelli and Montanari. S2 performs a heuristically guided search and replicates the modification in Bottom-up's successors, namely HS and AO*. Both S1 and S2 solve the problem of searching AND/OR graphs in presence of cycles. We then present a detailed analysis for the correctness and complexity results of S1 and S2, using the proposed framework. We have observed through experiments that S1 and S2 output correct results in all cases.
cs.AI:Thomas M. Strat has developed a decision-theoretic apparatus for Dempster-Shafer theory (Decision analysis using belief functions, Intern. J. Approx. Reason. 4(5/6), 391-417, 1990). In this apparatus, expected utility intervals are constructed for different choices. The choice with the highest expected utility is preferable to others. However, to find the preferred choice when the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of another, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals. This is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the ambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out as favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we might sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among the decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected utility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of each choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest expected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of rho under which an alternative is preferred. We must here take into account not only the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational choices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus, an assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the value of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary. It is sufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to discern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is justifiable.
cs.AI:Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer in 1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. This is a fundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian networks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating strategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this paper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete observations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with incomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and we use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In general, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior probabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions. This is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the incompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of classification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads to a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for classification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for a class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the more general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much harder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations, when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified.
cs.AI:As examples such as the Monty Hall puzzle show, applying conditioning to update a probability distribution on a ``naive space'', which does not take into account the protocol used, can often lead to counterintuitive results. Here we examine why. A criterion known as CAR (``coarsening at random'') in the statistical literature characterizes when ``naive'' conditioning in a naive space works. We show that the CAR condition holds rather infrequently, and we provide a procedural characterization of it, by giving a randomized algorithm that generates all and only distributions for which CAR holds. This substantially extends previous characterizations of CAR. We also consider more generalized notions of update such as Jeffrey conditioning and minimizing relative entropy (MRE). We give a generalization of the CAR condition that characterizes when Jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers, and show that there exist some very simple settings in which MRE essentially never gives the right results. This generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained in the literature on CAR and MRE.
cs.AI:Configuring consists in simulating the realization of a complex product from a catalog of component parts, using known relations between types, and picking values for object attributes. This highly combinatorial problem in the field of constraint programming has been addressed with a variety of approaches since the foundation system R1(McDermott82). An inherent difficulty in solving configuration problems is the existence of many isomorphisms among interpretations. We describe a formalism independent approach to improve the detection of isomorphisms by configurators, which does not require to adapt the problem model. To achieve this, we exploit the properties of a characteristic subset of configuration problems, called the structural sub-problem, which canonical solutions can be produced or tested at a limited cost. In this paper we present an algorithm for testing the canonicity of configurations, that can be added as a symmetry breaking constraint to any configurator. The cost and efficiency of this canonicity test are given.
cs.AI:This article introduces the idea that probabilistic reasoning (PR) may be understood as "information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search" (ICMAUS). In this context, multiple alignment has a meaning which is similar to but distinct from its meaning in bio-informatics, while unification means a simple merging of matching patterns, a meaning which is related to but simpler than the meaning of that term in logic.   A software model, SP61, has been developed for the discovery and formation of 'good' multiple alignments, evaluated in terms of information compression. The model is described in outline.   Using examples from the SP61 model, this article describes in outline how the ICMAUS framework can model various kinds of PR including: PR in best-match pattern recognition and information retrieval; one-step 'deductive' and 'abductive' PR; inheritance of attributes in a class hierarchy; chains of reasoning (probabilistic decision networks and decision trees, and PR with 'rules'); geometric analogy problems; nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values; modelling the function of a Bayesian network.
cs.AI:This article presents an overview of the idea that "information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search" (ICMAUS) may serve as a unifying principle in computing (including mathematics and logic) and in such aspects of human cognition as the analysis and production of natural language, fuzzy pattern recognition and best-match information retrieval, concept hierarchies with inheritance of attributes, probabilistic reasoning, and unsupervised inductive learning. The ICMAUS concepts are described together with an outline of the SP61 software model in which the ICMAUS concepts are currently realised. A range of examples is presented, illustrated with output from the SP61 model.
cs.AI:We propose a calculus integrating two calculi well-known in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR): Frank's projection-based cardinal direction calculus, and a coarser version of Freksa's relative orientation calculus. An original constraint propagation procedure is presented, which implements the interaction between the two integrated calculi. The importance of taking into account the interaction is shown with a real example providing an inconsistent knowledge base, whose inconsistency (a) cannot be detected by reasoning separately about each of the two components of the knowledge, just because, taken separately, each is consistent, but (b) is detected by the proposed algorithm, thanks to the interaction knowledge propagated from each of the two compnents to the other.
cs.AI:We define a ternary Relation Algebra (RA) of relative position relations on two-dimensional directed lines (d-lines for short). A d-line has two degrees of freedom (DFs): a rotational DF (RDF), and a translational DF (TDF). The representation of the RDF of a d-line will be handled by an RA of 2D orientations, CYC_t, known in the literature. A second algebra, TA_t, which will handle the TDF of a d-line, will be defined. The two algebras, CYC_t and TA_t, will constitute, respectively, the translational and the rotational components of the RA, PA_t, of relative position relations on d-lines: the PA_t atoms will consist of those pairs <t,r> of a TA_t atom and a CYC_t atom that are compatible. We present in detail the RA PA_t, with its converse table, its rotation table and its composition tables. We show that a (polynomial) constraint propagation algorithm, known in the literature, is complete for a subset of PA_t relations including almost all of the atomic relations. We will discuss the application scope of the RA, which includes incidence geometry, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), shape representation, localisation in (multi-)robot navigation, and the representation of motion prepositions in NLP (Natural Language Processing). We then compare the RA to existing ones, such as an algebra for reasoning about rectangles parallel to the axes of an (orthogonal) coordinate system, a ``spatial Odyssey'' of Allen's interval algebra, and an algebra for reasoning about 2D segments.
cs.AI:An intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions. Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should be based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations, physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about individuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of random worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many other non-deductive reasoning systems.
cs.AI:This paper describes an approach to the representation and processing of ontologies in the Semantic Web, based on the ICMAUS theory of computation and AI. This approach has strengths that complement those of languages based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) such as RDF Schema and DAML+OIL. The main benefits of the ICMAUS approach are simplicity and comprehensibility in the representation of ontologies, an ability to cope with errors and uncertainties in knowledge, and a versatile reasoning system with capabilities in the kinds of probabilistic reasoning that seem to be required in the Semantic Web.
cs.AI:Interactions are patterns between several attributes in data that cannot be inferred from any subset of these attributes. While mutual information is a well-established approach to evaluating the interactions between two attributes, we surveyed its generalizations as to quantify interactions between several attributes. We have chosen McGill's interaction information, which has been independently rediscovered a number of times under various names in various disciplines, because of its many intuitively appealing properties. We apply interaction information to visually present the most important interactions of the data. Visualization of interactions has provided insight into the structure of data on a number of domains, identifying redundant attributes and opportunities for constructing new features, discovering unexpected regularities in data, and have helped during construction of predictive models; we illustrate the methods on numerous examples. A machine learning method that disregards interactions may get caught in two traps: myopia is caused by learning algorithms assuming independence in spite of interactions, whereas fragmentation arises from assuming an interaction in spite of independence.
cs.AI:In this paper we develop an evidential force aggregation method intended for classification of evidential intelligence into recognized force structures. We assume that the intelligence has already been partitioned into clusters and use the classification method individually in each cluster. The classification is based on a measure of fitness between template and fused intelligence that makes it possible to handle intelligence reports with multiple nonspecific and uncertain propositions. With this measure we can aggregate on a level-by-level basis, starting from general intelligence to achieve a complete force structure with recognized units on all hierarchical levels.
cs.AI:Article discusses the application of Kullback-Leibler divergence to the recognition of speech signals and suggests three algorithms implementing this divergence criterion: correlation algorithm, spectral algorithm and filter algorithm. Discussion covers an approach to the problem of speech variability and is illustrated with the results of experimental modeling of speech signals. The article gives a number of recommendations on the choice of appropriate model parameters and provides a comparison to some other methods of speech recognition.
cs.AI:Richard Cox [1] set the axiomatic foundations of probable inference and the algebra of propositions. He showed that consistency within these axioms requires certain rules for updating belief. In this paper we use the analogy between probability and utility introduced in [2] to propose an axiomatic foundation for utility inference and the algebra of preferences. We show that consistency within these axioms requires certain rules for updating preference. We discuss a class of utility functions that stems from the axioms of utility inference and show that this class is the basic building block for any general multiattribute utility function. We use this class of utility functions together with the algebra of preferences to construct utility functions represented by logical operations on the attributes.
cs.AI:Recent literature in the last Maximum Entropy workshop introduced an analogy between cumulative probability distributions and normalized utility functions. Based on this analogy, a utility density function can de defined as the derivative of a normalized utility function. A utility density function is non-negative and integrates to unity. These two properties form the basis of a correspondence between utility and probability. A natural application of this analogy is a maximum entropy principle to assign maximum entropy utility values. Maximum entropy utility interprets many of the common utility functions based on the preference information needed for their assignment, and helps assign utility values based on partial preference information. This paper reviews maximum entropy utility and introduces further results that stem from the duality between probability and utility.
cs.AI:Abduction, first proposed in the setting of classical logics, has been studied with growing interest in the logic programming area during the last years.   In this paper we study abduction with penalization in the logic programming framework. This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously analyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant problems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal model for abduction with penalization over logic programs, which extends the abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge representation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive framework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from different domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning; their encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We thoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in the context of abduction with penalization from logic programs. Finally, we implement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the DLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from abduction problems with penalties into logic programs with weak constraints. We prove that this approach is sound and complete.
cs.AI:We study local-search satisfiability solvers for propositional logic extended with cardinality atoms, that is, expressions that provide explicit ways to model constraints on cardinalities of sets. Adding cardinality atoms to the language of propositional logic facilitates modeling search problems and often results in concise encodings. We propose two ``native'' local-search solvers for theories in the extended language. We also describe techniques to reduce the problem to standard propositional satisfiability and allow us to use off-the-shelf SAT solvers. We study these methods experimentally. Our general finding is that native solvers designed specifically for the extended language perform better than indirect methods relying on SAT solvers.
cs.AI:We describe WSAT(cc), a local-search solver for computing models of theories in the language of propositional logic extended by cardinality atoms. WSAT(cc) is a processing back-end for the logic PS+, a recently proposed formalism for answer-set programming.
cs.AI:This paper presents duality between probability distributions and utility functions.
cs.AI:Disjunctive Logic Programming (\DLP) is an advanced formalism for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). \DLP is very expressive in a precise mathematical sense: it allows to express every property of finite structures that is decidable in the complexity class $\SigmaP{2}$ ($\NP^{\NP}$). Importantly, the \DLP encodings are often simple and natural.   In this paper, we single out some limitations of \DLP for KRR, which cannot naturally express problems where the size of the disjunction is not known ``a priori'' (like N-Coloring), but it is part of the input. To overcome these limitations, we further enhance the knowledge modelling abilities of \DLP, by extending this language by {\em Parametric Connectives (OR and AND)}. These connectives allow us to represent compactly the disjunction/conjunction of a set of atoms having a given property. We formally define the semantics of the new language, named $DLP^{\bigvee,\bigwedge}$ and we show the usefulness of the new constructs on relevant knowledge-based problems. We address implementation issues and discuss related works.
cs.AI:The research field of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) aims to find abstractions, languages, methodologies and toolkits for modeling, verifying, validating and prototyping complex applications conceptualized as Multiagent Systems (MASs). A very lively research sub-field studies how formal methods can be used for AOSE. This paper presents a detailed survey of six logic-based executable agent specification languages that have been chosen for their potential to be integrated in our ARPEGGIO project, an open framework for specifying and prototyping a MAS. The six languages are ConGoLog, Agent-0, the IMPACT agent programming language, DyLog, Concurrent METATEM and Ehhf. For each executable language, the logic foundations are described and an example of use is shown. A comparison of the six languages and a survey of similar approaches complete the paper, together with considerations of the advantages of using logic-based languages in MAS modeling and prototyping.
cs.AI:We propose a generalization of expected utility that we call generalized EU (GEU), where a decision maker's beliefs are represented by plausibility measures, and the decision maker's tastes are represented by general (i.e.,not necessarily real-valued) utility functions. We show that every agent, ``rational'' or not, can be modeled as a GEU maximizer. We then show that we can customize GEU by selectively imposing just the constraints we want. In particular, we show how each of Savage's postulates corresponds to constraints on GEU.
cs.AI:Many different rules for decision making have been introduced in the literature. We show that a notion of generalized expected utility proposed in Part I of this paper is a universal decision rule, in the sense that it can represent essentially all other decision rules.
cs.AI:This paper describes a novel approach to grammar induction that has been developed within a framework designed to integrate learning with other aspects of computing, AI, mathematics and logic. This framework, called "information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search" (ICMAUS), is founded on principles of Minimum Length Encoding pioneered by Solomonoff and others. Most of the paper describes SP70, a computer model of the ICMAUS framework that incorporates processes for unsupervised learning of grammars. An example is presented to show how the model can infer a plausible grammar from appropriate input. Limitations of the current model and how they may be overcome are briefly discussed.
cs.AI:We consider the integration of existing cone-shaped and projection-based calculi of cardinal direction relations, well-known in QSR. The more general, integrating language we consider is based on convex constraints of the qualitative form $r(x,y)$, $r$ being a cone-shaped or projection-based cardinal direction atomic relation, or of the quantitative form $(\alpha ,\beta)(x,y)$, with $\alpha ,\beta\in [0,2\pi)$ and $(\beta -\alpha)\in [0,\pi ]$: the meaning of the quantitative constraint, in particular, is that point $x$ belongs to the (convex) cone-shaped area rooted at $y$, and bounded by angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The general form of a constraint is a disjunction of the form $[r_1\vee...\vee r_{n_1}\vee (\alpha_1,\beta_1)\vee...\vee (\alpha _{n_2},\beta_{n_2})](x,y)$, with $r_i(x,y)$, $i=1... n_1$, and $(\alpha _i,\beta_i)(x,y)$, $i=1... n_2$, being convex constraints as described above: the meaning of such a general constraint is that, for some $i=1... n_1$, $r_i(x,y)$ holds, or, for some $i=1... n_2$, $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$ holds. A conjunction of such general constraints is a $\tcsp$-like CSP, which we will refer to as an $\scsp$ (Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem). An effective solution search algorithm for an $\scsp$ will be described, which uses (1) constraint propagation, based on a composition operation to be defined, as the filtering method during the search, and (2) the Simplex algorithm, guaranteeing completeness, at the leaves of the search tree. The approach is particularly suited for large-scale high-level vision, such as, e.g., satellite-like surveillance of a geographic area.
cs.AI:Object oriented constraint programs (OOCPs) emerge as a leading evolution of constraint programming and artificial intelligence, first applied to a range of industrial applications called configuration problems. The rich variety of technical approaches to solving configuration problems (CLP(FD), CC(FD), DCSP, Terminological systems, constraint programs with set variables ...) is a source of difficulty. No universally accepted formal language exists for communicating about OOCPs, which makes the comparison of systems difficult. We present here a Z based specification of OOCPs which avoids the falltrap of hidden object semantics. The object system is part of the specification, and captures all of the most advanced notions from the object oriented modeling standard UML. The paper illustrates these issues and the conciseness and precision of Z by the specification of a working OOCP that solves an historical AI problem : parsing a context free grammar. Being written in Z, an OOCP specification also supports formal proofs. The whole builds the foundation of an adaptative and evolving framework for communicating about constrained object models and programs.
cs.AI:In this paper we suggest an architecture for a software agent which operates a physical device and is capable of making observations and of testing and repairing the device's components. We present simplified definitions of the notions of symptom, candidate diagnosis, and diagnosis which are based on the theory of action language ${\cal AL}$. The definitions allow one to give a simple account of the agent's behavior in which many of the agent's tasks are reduced to computing stable models of logic programs.
cs.AI:We compare two recent extensions of the answer set (stable model) semantics of logic programs. One of them, due to Lifschitz, Tang and Turner, allows the bodies and heads of rules to contain nested expressions. The other, due to Niemela and Simons, uses weight constraints. We show that there is a simple, modular translation from the language of weight constraints into the language of nested expressions that preserves the program's answer sets. Nested expressions can be eliminated from the result of this translation in favor of additional atoms. The translation makes it possible to compute answer sets for some programs with weight constraints using satisfiability solvers, and to prove the strong equivalence of programs with weight constraints using the logic of here-and there.
cs.AI:(We apologize for pidgin LaTeX) Schlipf \cite{sch91} proved that Stable Logic Programming (SLP) solves all $\mathit{NP}$ decision problems. We extend Schlipf's result to prove that SLP solves all search problems in the class $\mathit{NP}$. Moreover, we do this in a uniform way as defined in \cite{mt99}. Specifically, we show that there is a single $\mathrm{DATALOG}^{\neg}$ program $P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ such that given any Turing machine $M$, any polynomial $p$ with non-negative integer coefficients and any input $\sigma$ of size $n$ over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, there is an extensional database $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma}$ such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the stable models of $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma} \cup P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ and the accepting computations of the machine $M$ that reach the final state in at most $p(n)$ steps. Moreover, $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma}$ can be computed in polynomial time from $p$, $\sigma$ and the description of $M$ and the decoding of such accepting computations from its corresponding stable model of $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma} \cup P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ can be computed in linear time. A similar statement holds for Default Logic with respect to $\Sigma_2^\mathrm{P}$-search problems\footnote{The proof of this result involves additional technical complications and will be a subject of another publication.}.
cs.AI:This book develops the conjecture that all kinds of information processing in computers and in brains may usefully be understood as "information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search". This "SP theory", which has been under development since 1987, provides a unified view of such things as the workings of a universal Turing machine, the nature of 'knowledge', the interpretation and production of natural language, pattern recognition and best-match information retrieval, several kinds of probabilistic reasoning, planning and problem solving, unsupervised learning, and a range of concepts in mathematics and logic. The theory also provides a basis for the design of an 'SP' computer with several potential advantages compared with traditional digital computers.
cs.AI:In rule-based systems, goal-oriented computations correspond naturally to the possible ways that an observation may be explained. In some applications, we need to compute explanations for a series of observations with the same domain. The question whether previously computed answers can be recycled arises. A yes answer could result in substantial savings of repeated computations. For systems based on classic logic, the answer is YES. For nonmonotonic systems however, one tends to believe that the answer should be NO, since recycling is a form of adding information. In this paper, we show that computed answers can always be recycled, in a nontrivial way, for the class of rewrite procedures that we proposed earlier for logic programs with negation. We present some experimental results on an encoding of the logistics domain.
cs.AI:Recent advances in programming languages study and design have established a standard way of grounding computational systems representation in category theory. These formal results led to a better understanding of issues of control and side-effects in functional and imperative languages. This framework can be successfully applied to the investigation of the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference and cognitive systems. In this paper, we delineate a categorical formalisation of memory as a control structure driving performance in inference systems. Abstracting away control mechanisms from three widely used representations of memory in cognitive systems (scripts, production rules and clusters) we explain how categorical triples capture the interaction between learning and problem-solving.
cs.AI:The field of machine learning (ML) is concerned with the question of how to construct algorithms that automatically improve with experience. In recent years many successful ML applications have been developed, such as datamining programs, information-filtering systems, etc. Although ML algorithms allow the detection and extraction of interesting patterns of data for several kinds of problems, most of these algorithms are based on quantitative reasoning, as they rely on training data in order to infer so-called target functions.   In the last years defeasible argumentation has proven to be a sound setting to formalize common-sense qualitative reasoning. This approach can be combined with other inference techniques, such as those provided by machine learning theory.   In this paper we outline different alternatives for combining defeasible argumentation and machine learning techniques. We suggest how different aspects of a generic argument-based framework can be integrated with other ML-based approaches.
cs.AI:Stable model semantics has become a very popular approach for the management of negation in logic programming. This approach relies mainly on the closed world assumption to complete the available knowledge and its formulation has its basis in the so-called Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation.   The primary goal of this work is to present an alternative and epistemic-based characterization of stable model semantics, to the Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation. In particular, we show that stable model semantics can be defined entirely as an extension of the Kripke-Kleene semantics. Indeed, we show that the closed world assumption can be seen as an additional source of `falsehood' to be added cumulatively to the Kripke-Kleene semantics. Our approach is purely algebraic and can abstract from the particular formalism of choice as it is based on monotone operators (under the knowledge order) over bilattices only.
cs.AI:We address the problem of the development of representations and their relationship to the environment. We study a software agent which develops in a network a representation of its simple environment which captures and integrates the relationships between agent and environment through a closure mechanism. The inclusion of a variable behavior modifier allows better representation development. This can be confirmed with an internal description of the closure mechanism, and with an external description of the properties of the representation network.
cs.AI:This document describes syntax, semantics and implementation guidelines in order to enrich the DLV system with the possibility to make external C function calls. This feature is realized by the introduction of parametric external predicates, whose extension is not specified through a logic program but implicitly computed through external code.
cs.AI:This document describes the functions as they are treated in the DLV system. We give first the language, then specify the main implementation issues.
cs.AI:We introduce Ak, an extension of the action description language A (Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993) to handle actions which affect knowledge. We use sensing actions to increase an agent's knowledge of the world and non-deterministic actions to remove knowledge. We include complex plans involving conditionals and loops in our query language for hypothetical reasoning. We also present a translation of Ak domain descriptions into epistemic logic programs.
cs.AI:In this paper, we examine the performance of four fuzzy rule generation methods on Wisconsin breast cancer data. The first method generates fuzzy if then rules using the mean and the standard deviation of attribute values. The second approach generates fuzzy if then rules using the histogram of attributes values. The third procedure generates fuzzy if then rules with certainty of each attribute into homogeneous fuzzy sets. In the fourth approach, only overlapping areas are partitioned. The first two approaches generate a single fuzzy if then rule for each class by specifying the membership function of each antecedent fuzzy set using the information about attribute values of training patterns. The other two approaches are based on fuzzy grids with homogeneous fuzzy partitions of each attribute. The performance of each approach is evaluated on breast cancer data sets. Simulation results show that the Modified grid approach has a high classification rate of 99.73 %.
cs.AI:The integration of different learning and adaptation techniques to overcome individual limitations and to achieve synergetic effects through the hybridization or fusion of these techniques has, in recent years, contributed to a large number of new intelligent system designs. Computational intelligence is an innovative framework for constructing intelligent hybrid architectures involving Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), Probabilistic Reasoning (PR) and derivative free optimization techniques such as Evolutionary Computation (EC). Most of these hybridization approaches, however, follow an ad hoc design methodology, justified by success in certain application domains. Due to the lack of a common framework it often remains difficult to compare the various hybrid systems conceptually and to evaluate their performance comparatively. This chapter introduces the different generic architectures for integrating intelligent systems. The designing aspects and perspectives of different hybrid archirectures like NN-FIS, EC-FIS, EC-NN, FIS-PR and NN-FIS-EC systems are presented. Some conclusions are also provided towards the end.
cs.AI:Neuro-fuzzy systems have attracted growing interest of researchers in various scientific and engineering areas due to the increasing need of intelligent systems. This paper evaluates the use of two popular soft computing techniques and conventional statistical approach based on Box--Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict electricity demand in the State of Victoria, Australia. The soft computing methods considered are an evolving fuzzy neural network (EFuNN) and an artificial neural network (ANN) trained using scaled conjugate gradient algorithm (CGA) and backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The forecast accuracy is compared with the forecasts used by Victorian Power Exchange (VPX) and the actual energy demand. To evaluate, we considered load demand patterns for 10 consecutive months taken every 30 min for training the different prediction models. Test results show that the neuro-fuzzy system performed better than neural networks, ARIMA model and the VPX forecasts.
cs.AI:Fusion of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) have attracted the growing interest of researchers in various scientific and engineering areas due to the growing need of adaptive intelligent systems to solve the real world problems. ANN learns from scratch by adjusting the interconnections between layers. FIS is a popular computing framework based on the concept of fuzzy set theory, fuzzy if-then rules, and fuzzy reasoning. The advantages of a combination of ANN and FIS are obvious. There are several approaches to integrate ANN and FIS and very often it depends on the application. We broadly classify the integration of ANN and FIS into three categories namely concurrent model, cooperative model and fully fused model. This paper starts with a discussion of the features of each model and generalize the advantages and deficiencies of each model. We further focus the review on the different types of fused neuro-fuzzy systems and citing the advantages and disadvantages of each model.
cs.AI:Long-term rainfall prediction is a challenging task especially in the modern world where we are facing the major environmental problem of global warming. In general, climate and rainfall are highly non-linear phenomena in nature exhibiting what is known as the butterfly effect. While some regions of the world are noticing a systematic decrease in annual rainfall, others notice increases in flooding and severe storms. The global nature of this phenomenon is very complicated and requires sophisticated computer modeling and simulation to predict accurately. In this paper, we report a performance analysis for Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)and artificial neural networks for one month ahead prediction of rainfall. To evaluate the prediction efficiency, we made use of 87 years of rainfall data in Kerala state, the southern part of the Indian peninsula situated at latitude -longitude pairs (8o29'N - 76o57' E). We used an artificial neural network trained using the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm. The neural network and MARS were trained with 40 years of rainfall data. For performance evaluation, network predicted outputs were compared with the actual rainfall data. Simulation results reveal that MARS is a good forecasting tool and performed better than the considered neural network.
cs.AI:Classification of texture pattern is one of the most important problems in pattern recognition. In this paper, we present a classification method based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of texture image. As DCT works on gray level image, the color scheme of each image is transformed into gray levels. For classifying the images using DCT we used two popular soft computing techniques namely neurocomputing and neuro-fuzzy computing. We used a feedforward neural network trained using the backpropagation learning and an evolving fuzzy neural network to classify the textures. The soft computing models were trained using 80% of the texture data and remaining was used for testing and validation purposes. A performance comparison was made among the soft computing models for the texture classification problem. We also analyzed the effects of prolonged training of neural networks. It is observed that the proposed neuro-fuzzy model performed better than neural network.
cs.AI:Sorting by reversals is an important problem in inferring the evolutionary relationship between two genomes. The problem of sorting unsigned permutation has been proven to be NP-hard. The best guaranteed error bounded is the 3/2- approximation algorithm. However, the problem of sorting signed permutation can be solved easily. Fast algorithms have been developed both for finding the sorting sequence and finding the reversal distance of signed permutation. In this paper, we present a way to view the problem of sorting unsigned permutation as signed permutation. And the problem can then be seen as searching an optimal signed permutation in all n2 corresponding signed permutations. We use genetic algorithm to conduct the search. Our experimental result shows that the proposed method outperform the 3/2-approximation algorithm.
cs.AI:Past few years have witnessed a growing recognition of intelligent techniques for the construction of efficient and reliable intrusion detection systems. Due to increasing incidents of cyber attacks, building effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential for protecting information systems security, and yet it remains an elusive goal and a great challenge. In this paper, we report a performance analysis between Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), neural networks and support vector machines. The MARS procedure builds flexible regression models by fitting separate splines to distinct intervals of the predictor variables. A brief comparison of different neural network learning algorithms is also given.
cs.AI:The aim of our research was to apply well-known data mining techniques (such as linear neural networks, multi-layered perceptrons, probabilistic neural networks, classification and regression trees, support vector machines and finally a hybrid decision tree neural network approach) to the problem of predicting the quality of service in call centers; based on the performance data actually collected in a call center of a large insurance company. Our aim was two-fold. First, to compare the performance of models built using the above-mentioned techniques and, second, to analyze the characteristics of the input sensitivity in order to better understand the relationship between the perform-ance evaluation process and the actual performance and in this way help improve the performance of call centers. In this paper we summarize our findings.
cs.AI:The use of intelligent systems for stock market predictions has been widely established. In this paper, we investigate how the seemingly chaotic behavior of stock markets could be well represented using several connectionist paradigms and soft computing techniques. To demonstrate the different techniques, we considered Nasdaq-100 index of Nasdaq Stock MarketS and the S&P CNX NIFTY stock index. We analyzed 7 year's Nasdaq 100 main index values and 4 year's NIFTY index values. This paper investigates the development of a reliable and efficient technique to model the seemingly chaotic behavior of stock markets. We considered an artificial neural network trained using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Takagi-Sugeno neuro-fuzzy model and a Difference Boosting Neural Network (DBNN). This paper briefly explains how the different connectionist paradigms could be formulated using different learning methods and then investigates whether they can provide the required level of performance, which are sufficiently good and robust so as to provide a reliable forecast model for stock market indices. Experiment results reveal that all the connectionist paradigms considered could represent the stock indices behavior very accurately.
cs.AI:The purpose of this paper is to point to the usefulness of applying a linear mathematical formulation of fuzzy multiple criteria objective decision methods in organising business activities. In this respect fuzzy parameters of linear programming are modelled by preference-based membership functions. This paper begins with an introduction and some related research followed by some fundamentals of fuzzy set theory and technical concepts of fuzzy multiple objective decision models. Further a real case study of a manufacturing plant and the implementation of the proposed technique is presented. Empirical results clearly show the superiority of the fuzzy technique in optimising individual objective functions when compared to non-fuzzy approach. Furthermore, for the problem considered, the optimal solution helps to infer that by incorporating fuzziness in a linear programming model either in constraints, or both in objective functions and constraints, provides a similar (or even better) level of satisfaction for obtained results compared to non-fuzzy linear programming.
cs.AI:In this paper, we present MLEANN (Meta-Learning Evolutionary Artificial Neural Network), an automatic computational framework for the adaptive optimization of artificial neural networks wherein the neural network architecture, activation function, connection weights; learning algorithm and its parameters are adapted according to the problem. We explored the performance of MLEANN and conventionally designed artificial neural networks for function approximation problems. To evaluate the comparative performance, we used three different well-known chaotic time series. We also present the state of the art popular neural network learning algorithms and some experimentation results related to convergence speed and generalization performance. We explored the performance of backpropagation algorithm; conjugate gradient algorithm, quasi-Newton algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for the three chaotic time series. Performances of the different learning algorithms were evaluated when the activation functions and architecture were changed. We further present the theoretical background, algorithm, design strategy and further demonstrate how effective and inevitable is the proposed MLEANN framework to design a neural network, which is smaller, faster and with a better generalization performance.
cs.AI:The phylogenetic tree construction is to infer the evolutionary relationship between species from the experimental data. However, the experimental data are often imperfect and conflicting each others. Therefore, it is important to extract the motif from the imperfect data. The largest compatible subset problem is that, given a set of experimental data, we want to discard the minimum such that the remaining is compatible. The largest compatible subset problem can be viewed as the vertex cover problem in the graph theory that has been proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Evolutionary Computing (EC) method for this problem. The proposed method combines the EC approach and the algorithmic approach for special structured graphs. As a result, the complexity of the problem is dramatically reduced. Experiments were performed on randomly generated graphs with different edge densities. The vertex covers produced by the proposed method were then compared to the vertex covers produced by a 2-approximation algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed method consistently outperformed a classical 2- approximation algorithm. Furthermore, a significant improvement was found when the graph density was small.
cs.AI:Decision-making is a process of choosing among alternative courses of action for solving complicated problems where multi-criteria objectives are involved. The past few years have witnessed a growing recognition of Soft Computing technologies that underlie the conception, design and utilization of intelligent systems. Several works have been done where engineers and scientists have applied intelligent techniques and heuristics to obtain optimal decisions from imprecise information. In this paper, we present a concurrent fuzzy-neural network approach combining unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to develop the Tactical Air Combat Decision Support System (TACDSS). Experiment results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique.
cs.AI:In a universe with a single currency, there would be no foreign exchange market, no foreign exchange rates, and no foreign exchange. Over the past twenty-five years, the way the market has performed those tasks has changed enormously. The need for intelligent monitoring systems has become a necessity to keep track of the complex forex market. The vast currency market is a foreign concept to the average individual. However, once it is broken down into simple terms, the average individual can begin to understand the foreign exchange market and use it as a financial instrument for future investing. In this paper, we attempt to compare the performance of hybrid soft computing and hard computing techniques to predict the average monthly forex rates one month ahead. The soft computing models considered are a neural network trained by the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm and a neuro-fuzzy model implementing a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system. We also considered Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and a hybrid CART-MARS technique. We considered the exchange rates of Australian dollar with respect to US dollar, Singapore dollar, New Zealand dollar, Japanese yen and United Kingdom pounds. The models were trained using 70% of the data and remaining was used for testing and validation purposes. It is observed that the proposed hybrid models could predict the forex rates more accurately than all the techniques when applied individually. Empirical results also reveal that the hybrid hard computing approach also improved some of our previous work using a neuro-fuzzy approach.
cs.AI:The rapid e-commerce growth has made both business community and customers face a new situation. Due to intense competition on one hand and the customer's option to choose from several alternatives business community has realized the necessity of intelligent marketing strategies and relationship management. Web usage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data obtained from the interactions of the users with the Web. Web usage mining has become very critical for effective Web site management, creating adaptive Web sites, business and support services, personalization, network traffic flow analysis and so on. In this paper, we present the important concepts of Web usage mining and its various practical applications. We further present a novel approach 'intelligent-miner' (i-Miner) to optimize the concurrent architecture of a fuzzy clustering algorithm (to discover web data clusters) and a fuzzy inference system to analyze the Web site visitor trends. A hybrid evolutionary fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimally segregate similar user interests. The clustered data is then used to analyze the trends using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system learned using a combination of evolutionary algorithm and neural network learning. Proposed approach is compared with self-organizing maps (to discover patterns) and several function approximation techniques like neural networks, linear genetic programming and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system (to analyze the clusters). The results are graphically illustrated and the practical significance is discussed in detail. Empirical results clearly show that the proposed Web usage-mining framework is efficient.
cs.AI:Normally a decision support system is build to solve problem where multi-criteria decisions are involved. The knowledge base is the vital part of the decision support containing the information or data that is used in decision-making process. This is the field where engineers and scientists have applied several intelligent techniques and heuristics to obtain optimal decisions from imprecise information. In this paper, we present a hybrid neuro-genetic learning approach for the adaptation a Mamdani fuzzy inference system for the Tactical Air Combat Decision Support System (TACDSS). Some simulation results demonstrating the difference of the learning techniques and are also provided.
cs.AI:Several adaptation techniques have been investigated to optimize fuzzy inference systems. Neural network learning algorithms have been used to determine the parameters of fuzzy inference system. Such models are often called as integrated neuro-fuzzy models. In an integrated neuro-fuzzy model there is no guarantee that the neural network learning algorithm converges and the tuning of fuzzy inference system will be successful. Success of evolutionary search procedures for optimization of fuzzy inference system is well proven and established in many application areas. In this paper, we will explore how the optimization of fuzzy inference systems could be further improved using a meta-heuristic approach combining neural network learning and evolutionary computation. The proposed technique could be considered as a methodology to integrate neural networks, fuzzy inference systems and evolutionary search procedures. We present the theoretical frameworks and some experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique.
cs.AI:Evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANNs) refer to a special class of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in which evolution is another fundamental form of adaptation in addition to learning. Evolutionary algorithms are used to adapt the connection weights, network architecture and learning algorithms according to the problem environment. Even though evolutionary algorithms are well known as efficient global search algorithms, very often they miss the best local solutions in the complex solution space. In this paper, we propose a hybrid meta-heuristic learning approach combining evolutionary learning and local search methods (using 1st and 2nd order error information) to improve the learning and faster convergence obtained using a direct evolutionary approach. The proposed technique is tested on three different chaotic time series and the test results are compared with some popular neuro-fuzzy systems and a recently developed cutting angle method of global optimization. Empirical results reveal that the proposed technique is efficient in spite of the computational complexity.
cs.AI:The academic literature suggests that the extent of exporting by multinational corporation subsidiaries (MCS) depends on their product manufactured, resources, tax protection, customers and markets, involvement strategy, financial independence and suppliers' relationship with a multinational corporation (MNC). The aim of this paper is to model the complex export pattern behaviour using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system in order to determine the actual volume of MCS export output (sales exported). The proposed fuzzy inference system is optimised by using neural network learning and evolutionary computation. Empirical results clearly show that the proposed approach could model the export behaviour reasonable well compared to a direct neural network approach.
cs.AI:The costs of fatalities and injuries due to traffic accident have a great impact on society. This paper presents our research to model the severity of injury resulting from traffic accidents using artificial neural networks and decision trees. We have applied them to an actual data set obtained from the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) General Estimates System (GES). Experiment results reveal that in all the cases the decision tree outperforms the neural network. Our research analysis also shows that the three most important factors in fatal injury are: driver's seat belt usage, light condition of the roadway, and driver's alcohol usage.
cs.AI:This paper presents a comparative study of six soft computing models namely multilayer perceptron networks, Elman recurrent neural network, radial basis function network, Hopfield model, fuzzy inference system and hybrid fuzzy neural network for the hourly electricity demand forecast of Czech Republic. The soft computing models were trained and tested using the actual hourly load data for seven years. A comparison of the proposed techniques is presented for predicting 2 day ahead demands for electricity. Simulation results indicate that hybrid fuzzy neural network and radial basis function networks are the best candidates for the analysis and forecasting of electricity demand.
cs.AI:Decision-making is a process of choosing among alternative courses of action for solving complicated problems where multi-criteria objectives are involved. The past few years have witnessed a growing recognition of Soft Computing (SC) technologies that underlie the conception, design and utilization of intelligent systems. In this paper, we present different SC paradigms involving an artificial neural network trained using the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, two different fuzzy inference methods optimised using neural network learning/evolutionary algorithms and regression trees for developing intelligent decision support systems. We demonstrate the efficiency of the different algorithms by developing a decision support system for a Tactical Air Combat Environment (TACE). Some empirical comparisons between the different algorithms are also provided.
cs.AI:In this paper, we present a state-based regression function for planning domains where an agent does not have complete information and may have sensing actions. We consider binary domains and employ the 0-approximation [Son & Baral 2001] to define the regression function. In binary domains, the use of 0-approximation means using 3-valued states. Although planning using this approach is incomplete with respect to the full semantics, we adopt it to have a lower complexity. We prove the soundness and completeness of our regression formulation with respect to the definition of progression. More specifically, we show that (i) a plan obtained through regression for a planning problem is indeed a progression solution of that planning problem, and that (ii) for each plan found through progression, using regression one obtains that plan or an equivalent one. We then develop a conditional planner that utilizes our regression function. We prove the soundness and completeness of our planning algorithm and present experimental results with respect to several well known planning problems in the literature.
cs.AI:Defeasible logic is a rule-based nonmonotonic logic, with both strict and defeasible rules, and a priority relation on rules. We show that inference in the propositional form of the logic can be performed in linear time. This contrasts markedly with most other propositional nonmonotonic logics, in which inference is intractable.
cs.AI:Defeasible argumentation has experienced a considerable growth in AI in the last decade. Theoretical results have been combined with development of practical applications in AI & Law, Case-Based Reasoning and various knowledge-based systems. However, the dialectical process associated with inference is computationally expensive. This paper focuses on speeding up this inference process by pruning the involved search space. Our approach is twofold. On one hand, we identify distinguished literals for computing defeat. On the other hand, we restrict ourselves to a subset of all possible conflicting arguments by introducing dialectical constraints.
cs.AI:Main purposes of the paper are followings: 1) To show examples of the calculations in domain of QFT via ``derivative rules'' of an expert system; 2) To consider advantages and disadvantage that technology of the calculations; 3) To reflect about how one would develop new physical theories, what knowledge would be useful in their investigations and how this problem can be connected with designing an expert system.
cs.AI:We will try to tackle both the theoretical and practical aspects of a very important problem in chess programming as stated in the title of this article - the issue of draw detection by move repetition. The standard approach that has so far been employed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional matrices in original and compressed format as well as on the implementation of the so-called bitboard format.   The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors. Axon, in its current incarnation, plays chess at master strength (ca. 2400-2450 Elo, based on both Axon vs computer programs and Axon vs human masters in over 3000 games altogether).
cs.AI:Learning to respond to voice-text input involves the subject's ability in understanding the phonetic and text based contents and his/her ability to communicate based on his/her experience. The neuro-cognitive facility of the subject has to support two important domains in order to make the learning process complete. In many cases, though the understanding is complete, the response is partial. This is one valid reason why we need to support the information from the subject with scalable techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for abstraction of the contents from the output. This paper explores the feasibility of using NLP modules interlaced with Neural Networks to perform the required task in autogenic training related to medical applications.
cs.AI:Generalized evolutionary algorithm based on Tsallis canonical distribution is proposed. The algorithm uses Tsallis generalized canonical distribution to weigh the configurations for `selection' instead of Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. Our simulation results show that for an appropriate choice of non-extensive index that is offered by Tsallis statistics, evolutionary algorithms based on this generalization outperform algorithms based on Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution.
cs.AI:In this paper we present and evaluate a search strategy called Decomposition Based Search (DBS) which is based on two steps: subproblem generation and subproblem solution. The generation of subproblems is done through value ranking and domain splitting. Subdomains are explored so as to generate, according to the heuristic chosen, promising subproblems first.   We show that two well known search strategies, Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS) and Iterative Broadening (IB), can be seen as special cases of DBS. First we present a tuning of DBS that visits the same search nodes as IB, but avoids restarts. Then we compare both theoretically and computationally DBS and LDS using the same heuristic. We prove that DBS has a higher probability of being successful than LDS on a comparable number of nodes, under realistic assumptions. Experiments on a constraint satisfaction problem and an optimization problem show that DBS is indeed very effective if compared to LDS.
cs.AI:Solution techniques for Constraint Satisfaction and Optimisation Problems often make use of backtrack search methods, exploiting variable and value ordering heuristics. In this paper, we propose and analyse a very simple method to apply in case the value ordering heuristic produces ties: postponing the branching decision. To this end, we group together values in a tie, branch on this sub-domain, and defer the decision among them to lower levels of the search tree. We show theoretically and experimentally that this simple modification can dramatically improve the efficiency of the search strategy. Although in practise similar methods may have been applied already, to our knowledge, no empirical or theoretical study has been proposed in the literature to identify when and to what extent this strategy should be used.
cs.AI:In this paper, we propose an effective search procedure that interleaves two steps: subproblem generation and subproblem solution. We mainly focus on the first part. It consists of a variable domain value ranking based on reduced costs. Exploiting the ranking, we generate, in a Limited Discrepancy Search tree, the most promising subproblems first. An interesting result is that reduced costs provide a very precise ranking that allows to almost always find the optimal solution in the first generated subproblem, even if its dimension is significantly smaller than that of the original problem. Concerning the proof of optimality, we exploit a way to increase the lower bound for subproblems at higher discrepancies. We show experimental results on the TSP and its time constrained variant to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but the technique could be generalized for other problems.
cs.AI:One proposes a first alternative rule of combination to WAO (Weighted Average Operator) proposed recently by Josang, Daniel and Vannoorenberghe, called Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule (denoted PCR1). PCR1 and WAO are particular cases of WO (the Weighted Operator) because the conflicting mass is redistributed with respect to some weighting factors. In this first PCR rule, the proportionalization is done for each non-empty set with respect to the non-zero sum of its corresponding mass matrix - instead of its mass column average as in WAO, but the results are the same as Ph. Smets has pointed out. Also, we extend WAO (which herein gives no solution) for the degenerate case when all column sums of all non-empty sets are zero, and then the conflicting mass is transferred to the non-empty disjunctive form of all non-empty sets together; but if this disjunctive form happens to be empty, then one considers an open world (i.e. the frame of discernment might contain new hypotheses) and thus all conflicting mass is transferred to the empty set. In addition to WAO, we propose a general formula for PCR1 (WAO for non-degenerate cases).
cs.AI:In this paper one proposes a simple algorithm of combining the fusion rules, those rules which first use the conjunctive rule and then the transfer of conflicting mass to the non-empty sets, in such a way that they gain the property of associativity and fulfill the Markovian requirement for dynamic fusion. Also, a new rule, SDL-improved, is presented.
cs.AI:FLUX is a programming method for the design of agents that reason logically about their actions and sensor information in the presence of incomplete knowledge. The core of FLUX is a system of Constraint Handling Rules, which enables agents to maintain an internal model of their environment by which they control their own behavior. The general action representation formalism of the fluent calculus provides the formal semantics for the constraint solver. FLUX exhibits excellent computational behavior due to both a carefully restricted expressiveness and the inference paradigm of progression.
cs.AI:Boltzmann selection is an important selection mechanism in evolutionary algorithms as it has theoretical properties which help in theoretical analysis. However, Boltzmann selection is not used in practice because a good annealing schedule for the `inverse temperature' parameter is lacking. In this paper we propose a Cauchy annealing schedule for Boltzmann selection scheme based on a hypothesis that selection-strength should increase as evolutionary process goes on and distance between two selection strengths should decrease for the process to converge. To formalize these aspects, we develop formalism for selection mechanisms using fitness distributions and give an appropriate measure for selection-strength. In this paper, we prove an important result, by which we derive an annealing schedule called Cauchy annealing schedule. We demonstrate the novelty of proposed annealing schedule using simulations in the framework of genetic algorithms.
cs.AI:In this paper we propose five versions of a Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule (PCR) for information fusion together with several examples. From PCR1 to PCR2, PCR3, PCR4, PCR5 one increases the complexity of the rules and also the exactitude of the redistribution of conflicting masses. PCR1 restricted from the hyper-power set to the power set and without degenerate cases gives the same result as the Weighted Average Operator (WAO) proposed recently by J{\o}sang, Daniel and Vannoorenberghe but does not satisfy the neutrality property of vacuous belief assignment. That's why improved PCR rules are proposed in this paper. PCR4 is an improvement of minC and Dempster's rules. The PCR rules redistribute the conflicting mass, after the conjunctive rule has been applied, proportionally with some functions depending on the masses assigned to their corresponding columns in the mass matrix. There are infinitely many ways these functions (weighting factors) can be chosen depending on the complexity one wants to deal with in specific applications and fusion systems. Any fusion combination rule is at some degree ad-hoc.
cs.AI:This paper presents in detail the generalized pignistic transformation (GPT) succinctly developed in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) framework as a tool for decision process. The GPT allows to provide a subjective probability measure from any generalized basic belief assignment given by any corpus of evidence. We mainly focus our presentation on the 3D case and provide the complete result obtained by the GPT and its validation drawn from the probability theory.
cs.AI:Since no fusion theory neither rule fully satisfy all needed applications, the author proposes a Unification of Fusion Theories and a combination of fusion rules in solving problems/applications. For each particular application, one selects the most appropriate model, rule(s), and algorithm of implementation. We are working in the unification of the fusion theories and rules, which looks like a cooking recipe, better we'd say like a logical chart for a computer programmer, but we don't see another method to comprise/unify all things. The unification scenario presented herein, which is now in an incipient form, should periodically be updated incorporating new discoveries from the fusion and engineering research.
cs.AI:Normal forms for logic programs under stable/answer set semantics are introduced. We argue that these forms can simplify the study of program properties, mainly consistency. The first normal form, called the {\em kernel} of the program, is useful for studying existence and number of answer sets. A kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics, which are those that directly affect the existence of answer sets. The body of rules is composed of negative literals only. Thus, the kernel form tends to be significantly more compact than other formulations. Also, it is possible to check consistency of kernel programs in terms of colorings of the Extended Dependency Graph program representation which we previously developed. The second normal form is called {\em 3-kernel.} A 3-kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics. Rules in 3-kernel programs have at most two conditions, and each rule either belongs to a cycle, or defines a connection between cycles. 3-kernel programs may have positive conditions. The 3-kernel normal form is very useful for the static analysis of program consistency, i.e., the syntactic characterization of existence of answer sets. This result can be obtained thanks to a novel graph-like representation of programs, called Cycle Graph which presented in the companion article \cite{Cos04b}.
cs.AI:This paper may look like a glossary of the fusion rules and we also introduce new ones presenting their formulas and examples: Conjunctive, Disjunctive, Exclusive Disjunctive, Mixed Conjunctive-Disjunctive rules, Conditional rule, Dempster's, Yager's, Smets' TBM rule, Dubois-Prade's, Dezert-Smarandache classical and hybrid rules, Murphy's average rule, Inagaki-Lefevre-Colot-Vannoorenberghe Unified Combination rules [and, as particular cases: Iganaki's parameterized rule, Weighting Average Operator, minC (M. Daniel), and newly Proportional Conflict Redistribution rules (Smarandache-Dezert) among which PCR5 is the most exact way of redistribution of the conflicting mass to non-empty sets following the path of the conjunctive rule], Zhang's Center Combination rule, Convolutive x-Averaging, Consensus Operator (Josang), Cautious Rule (Smets), ?-junctions rules (Smets), etc. and three new T-norm & T-conorm rules adjusted from fuzzy and neutrosophic sets to information fusion (Tchamova-Smarandache). Introducing the degree of union and degree of inclusion with respect to the cardinal of sets not with the fuzzy set point of view, besides that of intersection, many fusion rules can be improved. There are corner cases where each rule might have difficulties working or may not get an expected result.
cs.AI:There are many examples in the literature that suggest that indistinguishability is intransitive, despite the fact that the indistinguishability relation is typically taken to be an equivalence relation (and thus transitive). It is shown that if the uncertainty perception and the question of when an agent reports that two things are indistinguishable are both carefully modeled, the problems disappear, and indistinguishability can indeed be taken to be an equivalence relation. Moreover, this model also suggests a logic of vagueness that seems to solve many of the problems related to vagueness discussed in the philosophical literature. In particular, it is shown here how the logic can handle the sorites paradox.
cs.AI:A careful analysis of conditioning in the Sleeping Beauty problem is done, using the formal model for reasoning about knowledge and probability developed by Halpern and Tuttle. While the Sleeping Beauty problem has been viewed as revealing problems with conditioning in the presence of imperfect recall, the analysis done here reveals that the problems are not so much due to imperfect recall as to asynchrony. The implications of this analysis for van Fraassen's Reflection Principle and Savage's Sure-Thing Principle are considered.
cs.AI:The paper is an attempt to generalize a methodology, which is similar to the bounded-input bounded-output method currently widely used for the system stability studies. The presented earlier methodology allows decomposition of input space into bounded subspaces and defining for each subspace its bounding surface. It also defines a corresponding predefined control, which maps any point of a bounded input into a desired bounded output subspace. This methodology was improved by providing a mechanism for the fast defining a bounded surface. This paper presents enhanced bounded-input bounded-predefined-control bounded-output approach, which provides adaptability feature to the control and allows transferring of a controlled system along a suboptimal trajectory.
cs.AI:The number of probability distributions required to populate a conditional probability table (CPT) in a Bayesian network, grows exponentially with the number of parent-nodes associated with that table. If the table is to be populated through knowledge elicited from a domain expert then the sheer magnitude of the task forms a considerable cognitive barrier. In this paper we devise an algorithm to populate the CPT while easing the extent of knowledge acquisition. The input to the algorithm consists of a set of weights that quantify the relative strengths of the influences of the parent-nodes on the child-node, and a set of probability distributions the number of which grows only linearly with the number of associated parent-nodes. These are elicited from the domain expert. The set of probabilities are obtained by taking into consideration the heuristics that experts use while arriving at probabilistic estimations. The algorithm is used to populate the CPT by computing appropriate weighted sums of the elicited distributions. We invoke the methods of information geometry to demonstrate how these weighted sums capture the expert's judgemental strategy.
cs.AI:Consider the problem of tracking a set of moving targets. Apart from the tracking result, it is often important to know where the tracking fails, either to steer sensors to that part of the state-space, or to inform a human operator about the status and quality of the obtained information. An intuitive quality measure is the correlation between two tracking results based on uncorrelated observations. In the case of Bayesian trackers such a correlation measure could be the Kullback-Leibler difference.   We focus on a scenario with a large number of military units moving in some terrain. The units are observed by several types of sensors and "meta-sensors" with force aggregation capabilities. The sensors register units of different size. Two separate multi-target probability hypothesis density (PHD) particle filters are used to track some type of units (e.g., companies) and their sub-units (e.g., platoons), respectively, based on observations of units of those sizes. Each observation is used in one filter only.   Although the state-space may well be the same in both filters, the posterior PHD distributions are not directly comparable -- one unit might correspond to three or four spatially distributed sub-units. Therefore, we introduce a mapping function between distributions for different unit size, based on doctrine knowledge of unit configuration.   The mapped distributions can now be compared -- locally or globally -- using some measure, which gives the correlation between two PHD distributions in a bounded volume of the state-space. To locate areas where the tracking fails, a discretized quality map of the state-space can be generated by applying the measure locally to different parts of the space.
cs.AI:We describe the recently introduced extremal optimization algorithm and apply it to target detection and association problems arising in pre-processing for multi-target tracking.   Here we consider the problem of pre-processing for multiple target tracking when the number of sensor reports received is very large and arrives in large bursts. In this case, it is sometimes necessary to pre-process reports before sending them to tracking modules in the fusion system. The pre-processing step associates reports to known tracks (or initializes new tracks for reports on objects that have not been seen before). It could also be used as a pre-process step before clustering, e.g., in order to test how many clusters to use.   The pre-processing is done by solving an approximate version of the original problem. In this approximation, not all pair-wise conflicts are calculated. The approximation relies on knowing how many such pair-wise conflicts that are necessary to compute. To determine this, results on phase-transitions occurring when coloring (or clustering) large random instances of a particular graph ensemble are used.
cs.AI:The management and combination of uncertain, imprecise, fuzzy and even paradoxical or high conflicting sources of information has always been, and still remains today, of primal importance for the development of reliable modern information systems involving artificial reasoning. In this chapter, we present a survey of our recent theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning, known as Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) in the literature, developed for dealing with imprecise, uncertain and paradoxical sources of information. We focus our presentation here rather on the foundations of DSmT, and on the two important new rules of combination, than on browsing specific applications of DSmT available in literature. Several simple examples are given throughout the presentation to show the efficiency and the generality of this new approach. The last part of this chapter concerns the presentation of the neutrosophic logic, the neutro-fuzzy inference and its connection with DSmT. Fuzzy logic and neutrosophic logic are useful tools in decision making after fusioning the information using the DSm hybrid rule of combination of masses.
cs.AI:In this paper, we propose a new method based on Hidden Markov Models to interpret temporal sequences of sensor data from mobile robots to automatically detect features. Hidden Markov Models have been used for a long time in pattern recognition, especially in speech recognition. Their main advantages over other methods (such as neural networks) are their ability to model noisy temporal signals of variable length. We show in this paper that this approach is well suited for interpretation of temporal sequences of mobile-robot sensor data. We present two distinct experiments and results: the first one in an indoor environment where a mobile robot learns to detect features like open doors or T-intersections, the second one in an outdoor environment where a different mobile robot has to identify situations like climbing a hill or crossing a rock.
cs.AI:In this paper, we present a rich semantic network based on a differential analysis. We then detail implemented measures that take into account common and differential features between words. In a last section, we describe some industrial applications.
cs.AI:Answer set programming (ASP) with disjunction offers a powerful tool for declaratively representing and solving hard problems. Many NP-complete problems can be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise and intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical "guess and check" nature of NP problems: The property is encoded in a way such that polynomial size certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. However, the problem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) is beyond NP, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. While these problems also have a clear "guess and check" structure, finding an encoding in a DLP reflecting this structure may sometimes be a non-obvious task, in particular if the "check" itself is a coNP-complete problem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and check programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check program. In this paper, we present general transformations of head-cycle free (extended) disjunctive logic programs into stratified and positive (extended) disjunctive logic programs based on meta-interpretation techniques. The answer sets of the original and the transformed program are in simple correspondence, and, moreover, inconsistency of the original program is indicated by a designated answer set of the transformed program. Our transformations facilitate the integration of separate "guess" and "check" programs, which are often easy to obtain, automatically into a single disjunctive logic program. Our results complement recent results on meta-interpretation in ASP, and extend methods and techniques for a declarative "guess and check" problem solving paradigm through ASP.
cs.AI:This paper presents an approach to enhance search engines with information about word senses available in WordNet. The approach exploits information about the conceptual relations within the lexical-semantic net. In the wrapper for search engines presented, WordNet information is used to specify user's request or to classify the results of a publicly available web search engine, like google, yahoo, etc.
cs.AI:This paper reports about experiments with GermaNet as a resource within domain specific document analysis. The main question to be answered is: How is the coverage of GermaNet in a specific domain? We report about results of a field test of GermaNet for analyses of autopsy protocols and present a sketch about the integration of GermaNet inside XDOC. Our remarks will contribute to a GermaNet user's wish list.
cs.AI:The aim of the project presented in this paper is to design a system for an NLG architecture, which supports the documentation process of eBusiness models. A major task is to enrich the formal description of an eBusiness model with additional information needed in an NLG task.
cs.AI:Lexical semantic resources, like WordNet, are often used in real applications of natural language document processing. For example, we integrated GermaNet in our document suite XDOC of processing of German forensic autopsy protocols. In addition to the hypernymy and synonymy relation, we want to adapt GermaNet's verb frames for our analysis. In this paper we outline an approach for the domain related enrichment of GermaNet verb frames by corpus based syntactic and co-occurred data analyses of real documents.
cs.AI:Real applications of natural language document processing are very often confronted with domain specific lexical gaps during the analysis of documents of a new domain. This paper describes an approach for the derivation of domain specific concepts for the extension of an existing ontology. As resources we need an initial ontology and a partially processed corpus of a domain. We exploit the specific characteristic of the sublanguage in the corpus. Our approach is based on syntactical structures (noun phrases) and compound analyses to extract information required for the extension of GermaNet's lexical resources.
cs.AI:We suggest to employ techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Representation (KR) to transform existing documents into documents amenable for the Semantic Web. Semantic Web documents have at least part of their semantics and pragmatics marked up explicitly in both a machine processable as well as human readable manner. XML and its related standards (XSLT, RDF, Topic Maps etc.) are the unifying platform for the tools and methodologies developed for different application scenarios.
cs.AI:This text introduces the twin deadlocks of strong artificial life. Conceptualization of life is a deadlock both because of the existence of a continuum between the inert and the living, and because we only know one instance of life. Computationalism is a second deadlock since it remains a matter of faith. Nevertheless, artificial life realizations quickly progress and recent constructions embed an always growing set of the intuitive properties of life. This growing gap between theory and realizations should sooner or later crystallize in some kind of paradigm shift and then give clues to break the twin deadlocks.
cs.AI:In this chapter we describe new neural-network techniques developed for visual mining clinical electroencephalograms (EEGs), the weak electrical potentials invoked by brain activity. These techniques exploit fruitful ideas of Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). Section 2 briefly describes the standard neural-network techniques which are able to learn well-suited classification modes from data presented by relevant features. Section 3 introduces an evolving cascade neural network technique which adds new input nodes as well as new neurons to the network while the training error decreases. This algorithm is applied to recognize artifacts in the clinical EEGs. Section 4 presents the GMDH-type polynomial networks learnt from data. We applied this technique to distinguish the EEGs recorded from an Alzheimer and a healthy patient as well as recognize EEG artifacts. Section 5 describes the new neural-network technique developed to induce multi-class concepts from data. We used this technique for inducing a 16-class concept from the large-scale clinical EEG data. Finally we discuss perspectives of applying the neural-network techniques to clinical EEGs.
cs.AI:Bayesian averaging over classification models allows the uncertainty of classification outcomes to be evaluated, which is of crucial importance for making reliable decisions in applications such as financial in which risks have to be estimated. The uncertainty of classification is determined by a trade-off between the amount of data available for training, the diversity of a classifier ensemble and the required performance. The interpretability of classification models can also give useful information for experts responsible for making reliable classifications. For this reason Decision Trees (DTs) seem to be attractive classification models. The required diversity of the DT ensemble can be achieved by using the Bayesian model averaging all possible DTs. In practice, the Bayesian approach can be implemented on the base of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of random sampling from the posterior distribution. For sampling large DTs, the MCMC method is extended by Reversible Jump technique which allows inducing DTs under given priors. For the case when the prior information on the DT size is unavailable, the sweeping technique defining the prior implicitly reveals a better performance. Within this Chapter we explore the classification uncertainty of the Bayesian MCMC techniques on some datasets from the StatLog Repository and real financial data. The classification uncertainty is compared within an Uncertainty Envelope technique dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability. This technique provides realistic estimates of the classification uncertainty which can be easily interpreted in statistical terms with the aim of risk evaluation.
cs.AI:Multiple Classifier Systems (MCSs) allow evaluation of the uncertainty of classification outcomes that is of crucial importance for safety critical applications. The uncertainty of classification is determined by a trade-off between the amount of data available for training, the classifier diversity and the required performance. The interpretability of MCSs can also give useful information for experts responsible for making reliable classifications. For this reason Decision Trees (DTs) seem to be attractive classification models for experts. The required diversity of MCSs exploiting such classification models can be achieved by using two techniques, the Bayesian model averaging and the randomised DT ensemble. Both techniques have revealed promising results when applied to real-world problems. In this paper we experimentally compare the classification uncertainty of the Bayesian model averaging with a restarting strategy and the randomised DT ensemble on a synthetic dataset and some domain problems commonly used in the machine learning community. To make the Bayesian DT averaging feasible, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. The classification uncertainty is evaluated within an Uncertainty Envelope technique dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability. Exploring a full posterior distribution, this technique produces realistic estimates which can be easily interpreted in statistical terms. In our experiments we found out that the Bayesian DTs are superior to the randomised DT ensembles within the Uncertainty Envelope technique.
cs.AI:Artificial intelligence (AI) research has evolved over the last few decades and knowledge acquisition research is at the core of AI research. PKAW-04 is one of three international knowledge acquisition workshops held in the Pacific-Rim, Canada and Europe over the last two decades. PKAW-04 has a strong emphasis on incremental knowledge acquisition, machine learning, neural nets and active mining.   The proceedings contain 19 papers that were selected by the program committee among 24 submitted papers. All papers were peer reviewed by at least two reviewers. The papers in these proceedings cover the methods and tools as well as the applications related to develop expert systems or knowledge based systems.
cs.AI:In the frame of designing a knowledge discovery system, we have developed stochastic models based on high-order hidden Markov models. These models are capable to map sequences of data into a Markov chain in which the transitions between the states depend on the \texttt{n} previous states according to the order of the model. We study the process of achieving information extraction fromspatial and temporal data by means of an unsupervised classification. We use therefore a French national database related to the land use of a region, named Teruti, which describes the land use both in the spatial and temporal domain. Land-use categories (wheat, corn, forest, ...) are logged every year on each site regularly spaced in the region. They constitute a temporal sequence of images in which we look for spatial and temporal dependencies. The temporal segmentation of the data is done by means of a second-order Hidden Markov Model (\hmmd) that appears to have very good capabilities to locate stationary segments, as shown in our previous work in speech recognition. Thespatial classification is performed by defining a fractal scanning ofthe images with the help of a Hilbert-Peano curve that introduces atotal order on the sites, preserving the relation ofneighborhood between the sites. We show that the \hmmd performs aclassification that is meaningful for the agronomists.Spatial and temporal classification may be achieved simultaneously by means of a 2 levels \hmmd that measures the \aposteriori probability to map a temporal sequence of images onto a set of hidden classes.
cs.AI:Our ongoing work aims at defining an ontology-centered approach for building expertise models for the CommonKADS methodology. This approach (which we have named "OntoKADS") is founded on a core problem-solving ontology which distinguishes between two conceptualization levels: at an object level, a set of concepts enable us to define classes of problem-solving situations, and at a meta level, a set of meta-concepts represent modeling primitives. In this article, our presentation of OntoKADS will focus on the core ontology and, in particular, on roles - the primitive situated at the interface between domain knowledge and reasoning, and whose ontological status is still much debated. We first propose a coherent, global, ontological framework which enables us to account for this primitive. We then show how this novel characterization of the primitive allows definition of new rules for the construction of expertise models.
cs.AI:Automatic or assisted workflow composition is a field of intense research for applications to the world wide web or to business process modeling. Workflow composition is traditionally addressed in various ways, generally via theorem proving techniques. Recent research observed that building a composite workflow bears strong relationships with finite model search, and that some workflow languages can be defined as constrained object metamodels . This lead to consider the viability of applying configuration techniques to this problem, which was proven feasible. Constrained based configuration expects a constrained object model as input. The purpose of this document is to formally specify the constrained object model involved in ongoing experiments and research using the Z specification language.
cs.AI:To the reduct problems of decision system, the paper proposes the notion of dynamic core according to the dynamic reduct model. It describes various formal definitions of dynamic core, and discusses some properties about dynamic core. All of these show that dynamic core possesses the essential characters of the feature core.
cs.AI:Correlated time series are time series that, by virtue of the underlying process to which they refer, are expected to influence each other strongly. We introduce a novel approach to handle such time series, one that models their interaction as a two-dimensional cellular automaton and therefore allows them to be treated as a single entity. We apply our approach to the problems of filling gaps and predicting values in rainfall time series. Computational results show that the new approach compares favorably to Kalman smoothing and filtering.
cs.AI:ATNoSFERES is a Pittsburgh style Learning Classifier System (LCS) in which the rules are represented as edges of an Augmented Transition Network. Genotypes are strings of tokens of a stack-based language, whose execution builds the labeled graph. The original ATNoSFERES, using a bitstring to represent the language tokens, has been favorably compared in previous work to several Michigan style LCSs architectures in the context of Non Markov problems. Several modifications of ATNoSFERES are proposed here: the most important one conceptually being a representational change: each token is now represented by an integer, hence the genotype is a string of integers; several other modifications of the underlying grammar language are also proposed. The resulting ATNoSFERES-II is validated on several standard animat Non Markov problems, on which it outperforms all previously published results in the LCS literature. The reasons for these improvement are carefully analyzed, and some assumptions are proposed on the underlying mechanisms in order to explain these good results.
cs.AI:We present a declarative language, PP, for the high-level specification of preferences between possible solutions (or trajectories) of a planning problem. This novel language allows users to elegantly express non-trivial, multi-dimensional preferences and priorities over such preferences. The semantics of PP allows the identification of most preferred trajectories for a given goal. We also provide an answer set programming implementation of planning problems with PP preferences.
cs.AI:Clustering is a widely used technique in data mining applications for discovering patterns in underlying data. Most traditional clustering algorithms are limited to handling datasets that contain either numeric or categorical attributes. However, datasets with mixed types of attributes are common in real life data mining applications. In this paper, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer technique to solve this problem. First, the original mixed dataset is divided into two sub-datasets: the pure categorical dataset and the pure numeric dataset. Next, existing well established clustering algorithms designed for different types of datasets are employed to produce corresponding clusters. Last, the clustering results on the categorical and numeric dataset are combined as a categorical dataset, on which the categorical data clustering algorithm is used to get the final clusters. Our contribution in this paper is to provide an algorithm framework for the mixed attributes clustering problem, in which existing clustering algorithms can be easily integrated, the capabilities of different kinds of clustering algorithms and characteristics of different types of datasets could be fully exploited. Comparisons with other clustering algorithms on real life datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach.
cs.AI:Clustering categorical data is an integral part of data mining and has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we present k-histogram, a new efficient algorithm for clustering categorical data. The k-histogram algorithm extends the k-means algorithm to categorical domain by replacing the means of clusters with histograms, and dynamically updates histograms in the clustering process. Experimental results on real datasets show that k-histogram algorithm can produce better clustering results than k-modes algorithm, the one related with our work most closely.
cs.AI:This report describes a new version of the OntoSpec methodology for ontology building. Defined by the LaRIA Knowledge Engineering Team (University of Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, France), OntoSpec aims at helping builders to model ontological knowledge (upstream of formal representation). The methodology relies on a set of rigorously-defined modelling primitives and principles. Its application leads to the elaboration of a semi-informal ontology, which is independent of knowledge representation languages. We recently enriched the OntoSpec methodology by endowing it with a new resource, the DOLCE top-level ontology defined at the LOA (IST-CNR, Trento, Italy). The goal of this integration is to provide modellers with additional help in structuring application ontologies, while maintaining independence vis-\`{a}-vis formal representation languages. In this report, we first provide an overview of the OntoSpec methodology's general principles and then describe the DOLCE re-engineering process. A complete version of DOLCE-OS (i.e. a specification of DOLCE in the semi-informal OntoSpec language) is presented in an appendix.
cs.AI:In this paper we present a new approach for marker less human motion capture from conventional camera feeds. The aim of our study is to recover 3D positions of key points of the body that can serve for gait analysis. Our approach is based on foreground segmentation, an articulated body model and particle filters. In order to be generic and simple no restrictive dynamic modelling was used. A new modified particle filtering algorithm was introduced. It is used efficiently to search the model configuration space. This new algorithm which we call Interval Particle Filtering reorganizes the configurations search space in an optimal deterministic way and proved to be efficient in tracking natural human movement. Results for human motion capture from a single camera are presented and compared to results obtained from a marker based system. The system proved to be able to track motion successfully even in partial occlusions.
cs.AI:The aim of our study is to detect balance disorders and a tendency towards the falls in the elderly, knowing gait parameters. In this paper we present a new tool for gait analysis based on markerless human motion capture, from camera feeds. The system introduced here, recovers the 3D positions of several key points of the human body while walking. Foreground segmentation, an articulated body model and particle filtering are basic elements of our approach. No dynamic model is used thus this system can be described as generic and simple to implement. A modified particle filtering algorithm, which we call Interval Particle Filtering, is used to reorganise and search through the model's configurations search space in a deterministic optimal way. This algorithm was able to perform human movement tracking with success. Results from the treatment of a single cam feeds are shown and compared to results obtained using a marker based human motion capture system.
cs.AI:An agent often has a number of hypotheses, and must choose among them based on observations, or outcomes of experiments. Each of these observations can be viewed as providing evidence for or against various hypotheses. All the attempts to formalize this intuition up to now have assumed that associated with each hypothesis h there is a likelihood function \mu_h, which is a probability measure that intuitively describes how likely each observation is, conditional on h being the correct hypothesis. We consider an extension of this framework where there is uncertainty as to which of a number of likelihood functions is appropriate, and discuss how one formal approach to defining evidence, which views evidence as a function from priors to posteriors, can be generalized to accommodate this uncertainty.
cs.AI:Being able to analyze and interpret signal coming from electroencephalogram (EEG) recording can be of high interest for many applications including medical diagnosis and Brain-Computer Interfaces. Indeed, human experts are today able to extract from this signal many hints related to physiological as well as cognitive states of the recorded subject and it would be very interesting to perform such task automatically but today no completely automatic system exists. In previous studies, we have compared human expertise and automatic processing tools, including artificial neural networks (ANN), to better understand the competences of each and determine which are the difficult aspects to integrate in a fully automatic system. In this paper, we bring more elements to that study in reporting the main results of a practical experiment which was carried out in an hospital for sleep pathology study. An EEG recording was studied and labeled by a human expert and an ANN. We describe here the characteristics of the experiment, both human and neuronal procedure of analysis, compare their performances and point out the main limitations which arise from this study.
cs.AI:Train timetabling is a difficult and very tightly constrained combinatorial problem that deals with the construction of train schedules. We focus on the particular problem of local reconstruction of the schedule following a small perturbation, seeking minimisation of the total accumulated delay by adapting times of departure and arrival for each train and allocation of resources (tracks, routing nodes, etc.). We describe a permutation-based evolutionary algorithm that relies on a semi-greedy heuristic to gradually reconstruct the schedule by inserting trains one after the other following the permutation. This algorithm can be hybridised with ILOG commercial MIP programming tool CPLEX in a coarse-grained manner: the evolutionary part is used to quickly obtain a good but suboptimal solution and this intermediate solution is refined using CPLEX. Experimental results are presented on a large real-world case involving more than one million variables and 2 million constraints. Results are surprisingly good as the evolutionary algorithm, alone or hybridised, produces excellent solutions much faster than CPLEX alone.
cs.AI:Evolutionary computing (EC) is an exciting development in Computer Science. It amounts to building, applying and studying algorithms based on the Darwinian principles of natural selection. In this paper we briefly introduce the main concepts behind evolutionary computing. We present the main components all evolutionary algorithms (EA), sketch the differences between different types of EAs and survey application areas ranging from optimization, modeling and simulation to entertainment.
cs.AI:This article is taken out.
cs.AI:A fuzzy controller is usually designed by formulating the knowledge of a human expert into a set of linguistic variables and fuzzy rules. Among the most successful methods to automate the fuzzy controllers development process are evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we propose the Recurrent Fuzzy Voronoi (RFV) model, a representation for recurrent fuzzy systems. It is an extension of the FV model proposed by Kavka and Schoenauer that extends the application domain to include temporal problems. The FV model is a representation for fuzzy controllers based on Voronoi diagrams that can represent fuzzy systems with synergistic rules, fulfilling the $\epsilon$-completeness property and providing a simple way to introduce a priory knowledge. In the proposed representation, the temporal relations are embedded by including internal units that provide feedback by connecting outputs to inputs. These internal units act as memory elements. In the RFV model, the semantic of the internal units can be specified together with the a priori rules. The geometric interpretation of the rules allows the use of geometric variational operators during the evolution. The representation and the algorithms are validated in two problems in the area of system identification and evolutionary robotics.
cs.AI:When solving numerical constraints such as nonlinear equations and inequalities, solvers often exploit pruning techniques, which remove redundant value combinations from the domains of variables, at pruning steps. To find the complete solution set, most of these solvers alternate the pruning steps with branching steps, which split each problem into subproblems. This forms the so-called branch-and-prune framework, well known among the approaches for solving numerical constraints. The basic branch-and-prune search strategy that uses domain bisections in place of the branching steps is called the bisection search. In general, the bisection search works well in case (i) the solutions are isolated, but it can be improved further in case (ii) there are continuums of solutions (this often occurs when inequalities are involved). In this paper, we propose a new branch-and-prune search strategy along with several variants, which not only allow yielding better branching decisions in the latter case, but also work as well as the bisection search does in the former case. These new search algorithms enable us to employ various pruning techniques in the construction of inner and outer approximations of the solution set. Our experiments show that these algorithms speed up the solving process often by one order of magnitude or more when solving problems with continuums of solutions, while keeping the same performance as the bisection search when the solutions are isolated.
cs.AI:IS success is a complex concept, and its evaluation is complicated, unstructured and not readily quantifiable. Numerous scientific publications address the issue of success in the IS field as well as in other fields. But, little efforts have been done for processing indeterminacy and uncertainty in success research. This paper shows a formal method for mapping success using Neutrosophic Success Map. This is an emerging tool for processing indeterminacy and uncertainty in success research. EIS success have been analyzed using this tool.
cs.AI:In this paper, a mathematical schema theory is developed. This theory has three roots: brain theory schemas, grid automata, and block-shemas. In Section 2 of this paper, elements of the theory of grid automata necessary for the mathematical schema theory are presented. In Section 3, elements of brain theory necessary for the mathematical schema theory are presented. In Section 4, other types of schemas are considered. In Section 5, the mathematical schema theory is developed. The achieved level of schema representation allows one to model by mathematical tools virtually any type of schemas considered before, including schemas in neurophisiology, psychology, computer science, Internet technology, databases, logic, and mathematics.
cs.AI:Data-based classification is fundamental to most branches of science. While recent years have brought enormous progress in various areas of statistical computing and clustering, some general challenges in clustering remain: model selection, robustness, and scalability to large datasets. We consider the important problem of deciding on the optimal number of clusters, given an arbitrary definition of space and clusteriness. We show how to construct a cluster information criterion that allows objective model selection. Differing from other approaches, our truecluster method does not require specific assumptions about underlying distributions, dissimilarity definitions or cluster models. Truecluster puts arbitrary clustering algorithms into a generic unified (sampling-based) statistical framework. It is scalable to big datasets and provides robust cluster assignments and case-wise diagnostics. Truecluster will make clustering more objective, allows for automation, and will save time and costs. Free R software is available.
cs.AI:An original approach, termed Divide-and-Evolve is proposed to hybridize Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with Operational Research (OR) methods in the domain of Temporal Planning Problems (TPPs). Whereas standard Memetic Algorithms use local search methods to improve the evolutionary solutions, and thus fail when the local method stops working on the complete problem, the Divide-and-Evolve approach splits the problem at hand into several, hopefully easier, sub-problems, and can thus solve globally problems that are intractable when directly fed into deterministic OR algorithms. But the most prominent advantage of the Divide-and-Evolve approach is that it immediately opens up an avenue for multi-objective optimization, even though the OR method that is used is single-objective. Proof of concept approach on the standard (single-objective) Zeno transportation benchmark is given, and a small original multi-objective benchmark is proposed in the same Zeno framework to assess the multi-objective capabilities of the proposed methodology, a breakthrough in Temporal Planning.
cs.AI:This article considers evidence from physical and biological sciences to show machines are deficient compared to biological systems at incorporating intelligence. Machines fall short on two counts: firstly, unlike brains, machines do not self-organize in a recursive manner; secondly, machines are based on classical logic, whereas Nature's intelligence may depend on quantum mechanics.
cs.AI:Constraint Programming (CP) has proved an effective paradigm to model and solve difficult combinatorial satisfaction and optimisation problems from disparate domains. Many such problems arising from the commercial world are permeated by data uncertainty. Existing CP approaches that accommodate uncertainty are less suited to uncertainty arising due to incomplete and erroneous data, because they do not build reliable models and solutions guaranteed to address the user's genuine problem as she perceives it. Other fields such as reliable computation offer combinations of models and associated methods to handle these types of uncertain data, but lack an expressive framework characterising the resolution methodology independently of the model.   We present a unifying framework that extends the CP formalism in both model and solutions, to tackle ill-defined combinatorial problems with incomplete or erroneous data. The certainty closure framework brings together modelling and solving methodologies from different fields into the CP paradigm to provide reliable and efficient approches for uncertain constraint problems. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework on a case study in network diagnosis. We define resolution forms that give generic templates, and their associated operational semantics, to derive practical solution methods for reliable solutions.
cs.AI:The application of Genetic Programming to the discovery of empirical laws is often impaired by the huge size of the search space, and consequently by the computer resources needed. In many cases, the extreme demand for memory and CPU is due to the massive growth of non-coding segments, the introns. The paper presents a new program evolution framework which combines distribution-based evolution in the PBIL spirit, with grammar-based genetic programming; the information is stored as a probability distribution on the gra mmar rules, rather than in a population. Experiments on a real-world like problem show that this approach gives a practical solution to the problem of intron growth.
cs.AI:This paper deals with the problem of classifying signals. The new method for building so called local classifiers and local features is presented. The method is a combination of the lifting scheme and the support vector machines. Its main aim is to produce effective and yet comprehensible classifiers that would help in understanding processes hidden behind classified signals. To illustrate the method we present the results obtained on an artificial and a real dataset.
cs.AI:Open answer set programming (OASP) is an extension of answer set programming where one may ground a program with an arbitrary superset of the program's constants. We define a fixed point logic (FPL) extension of Clark's completion such that open answer sets correspond to models of FPL formulas and identify a syntactic subclass of programs, called (loosely) guarded programs. Whereas reasoning with general programs in OASP is undecidable, the FPL translation of (loosely) guarded programs falls in the decidable (loosely) guarded fixed point logic (mu(L)GF). Moreover, we reduce normal closed ASP to loosely guarded OASP, enabling for the first time, a characterization of an answer set semantics by muLGF formulas. We further extend the open answer set semantics for programs with generalized literals. Such generalized programs (gPs) have interesting properties, e.g., the ability to express infinity axioms. We restrict the syntax of gPs such that both rules and generalized literals are guarded. Via a translation to guarded fixed point logic, we deduce 2-exptime-completeness of satisfiability checking in such guarded gPs (GgPs). Bound GgPs are restricted GgPs with exptime-complete satisfiability checking, but still sufficiently expressive to optimally simulate computation tree logic (CTL). We translate Datalog lite programs to GgPs, establishing equivalence of GgPs under an open answer set semantics, alternation-free muGF, and Datalog lite.
cs.AI:Consistency check has been the only criterion for theory evaluation in logic-based approaches to reasoning about actions. This work goes beyond that and contributes to the metatheory of actions by investigating what other properties a good domain description in reasoning about actions should have. We state some metatheoretical postulates concerning this sore spot. When all postulates are satisfied together we have a modular action theory. Besides being easier to understand and more elaboration tolerant in McCarthy's sense, modular theories have interesting properties. We point out the problems that arise when the postulates about modularity are violated and propose algorithmic checks that can help the designer of an action theory to overcome them.
cs.AI:The estimation of linear causal models (also known as structural equation models) from data is a well-known problem which has received much attention in the past. Most previous work has, however, made an explicit or implicit assumption of gaussianity, limiting the identifiability of the models. We have recently shown (Shimizu et al, 2005; Hoyer et al, 2006) that for non-gaussian distributions the full causal model can be estimated in the no hidden variables case. In this contribution, we discuss the estimation of the model when confounding latent variables are present. Although in this case uniqueness is no longer guaranteed, there is at most a finite set of models which can fit the data. We develop an algorithm for estimating this set, and describe numerical simulations which confirm the theoretical arguments and demonstrate the practical viability of the approach. Full Matlab code is provided for all simulations.
cs.AI:Shock physics experiments are often complicated and expensive. As a result, researchers are unable to conduct as many experiments as they would like - leading to sparse data sets. In this paper, Support Vector Machines for regression are applied to velocimetry data sets for shock damaged and melted tin metal. Some success at interpolating between data sets is achieved. Implications for future work are discussed.
cs.AI:In this paper, we study clustering with respect to the k-modes objective function, a natural formulation of clustering for categorical data. One of the main contributions of this paper is to establish the connection between k-modes and k-median, i.e., the optimum of k-median is at most twice the optimum of k-modes for the same categorical data clustering problem. Based on this observation, we derive a deterministic algorithm that achieves an approximation factor of 2. Furthermore, we prove that the distance measure in k-modes defines a metric. Hence, we are able to extend existing approximation algorithms for metric k-median to k-modes. Empirical results verify the superiority of our method.
cs.AI:A model of an organism as an autonomous intelligent system has been proposed. This model was used to analyze learning of an organism in various environmental conditions. Processes of learning were divided into two types: strong and weak processes taking place in the absence and the presence of aprioristic information about an object respectively. Weak learning is synonymous to adaptation when aprioristic programs already available in a system (an organism) are started. It was shown that strong learning is impossible for both an organism and any autonomous intelligent system. It was shown also that the knowledge base of an organism cannot be updated. Therefore, all behavior programs of an organism are congenital. A model of a conditioned reflex as a series of consecutive measurements of environmental parameters has been advanced. Repeated measurements are necessary in this case to reduce the error during decision making.
cs.AI:This paper presents two new promising rules of combination for the fusion of uncertain and potentially highly conflicting sources of evidences in the framework of the theory of belief functions in order to palliate the well-know limitations of Dempster's rule and to work beyond the limits of applicability of the Dempster-Shafer theory. We present both a new class of adaptive combination rules (ACR) and a new efficient Proportional Conflict Redistribution (PCR) rule allowing to deal with highly conflicting sources for static and dynamic fusion applications.
cs.AI:Fuzzy automata, whose input alphabet is a set of numbers or symbols, are a formal model of computing with values. Motivated by Zadeh's paradigm of computing with words rather than numbers, Ying proposed a kind of fuzzy automata, whose input alphabet consists of all fuzzy subsets of a set of symbols, as a formal model of computing with all words. In this paper, we introduce a somewhat general formal model of computing with (some special) words. The new features of the model are that the input alphabet only comprises some (not necessarily all) fuzzy subsets of a set of symbols and the fuzzy transition function can be specified arbitrarily. By employing the methodology of fuzzy control, we establish a retraction principle from computing with words to computing with values for handling crisp inputs and a generalized extension principle from computing with words to computing with all words for handling fuzzy inputs. These principles show that computing with values and computing with all words can be respectively implemented by computing with words. Some algebraic properties of retractions and generalized extensions are addressed as well.
cs.AI:Through the Internet and the World-Wide Web, a vast number of information sources has become available, which offer information on various subjects by different providers, often in heterogeneous formats. This calls for tools and methods for building an advanced information-processing infrastructure. One issue in this area is the selection of suitable information sources in query answering. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this problem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources (prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user query. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of the information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a formal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as well). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a query description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection programs, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured nature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must carefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and furthermore combine it with possible user preferences. A prototype implementation of our approach has been realized exploiting the DLV KR system and its plp front-end for prioritized ELPs. We describe a representative example involving specific movie databases, and report about experimental results.
cs.AI:It is well known that perspective alignment plays a major role in the planning and interpretation of spatial language. In order to understand the role of perspective alignment and the cognitive processes involved, we have made precise complete cognitive models of situated embodied agents that self-organise a communication system for dialoging about the position and movement of real world objects in their immediate surroundings. We show in a series of robotic experiments which cognitive mechanisms are necessary and sufficient to achieve successful spatial language and why and how perspective alignment can take place, either implicitly or based on explicit marking.
cs.AI:We extend the 0-approximation of sensing actions and incomplete information in [Son and Baral 2000] to action theories with static causal laws and prove its soundness with respect to the possible world semantics. We also show that the conditional planning problem with respect to this approximation is NP-complete. We then present an answer set programming based conditional planner, called ASCP, that is capable of generating both conformant plans and conditional plans in the presence of sensing actions, incomplete information about the initial state, and static causal laws. We prove the correctness of our implementation and argue that our planner is sound and complete with respect to the proposed approximation. Finally, we present experimental results comparing ASCP to other planners.
cs.AI:Computing and storing probabilities is a hard problem as soon as one has to deal with complex distributions over multiple random variables. The problem of efficient representation of probability distributions is central in term of computational efficiency in the field of probabilistic reasoning. The main problem arises when dealing with joint probability distributions over a set of random variables: they are always represented using huge probability arrays. In this paper, a new method based on binary-tree representation is introduced in order to store efficiently very large joint distributions. Our approach approximates any multidimensional joint distributions using an adaptive discretization of the space. We make the assumption that the lower is the probability mass of a particular region of feature space, the larger is the discretization step. This assumption leads to a very optimized representation in term of time and memory. The other advantages of our approach are the ability to refine dynamically the distribution every time it is needed leading to a more accurate representation of the probability distribution and to an anytime representation of the distribution.
cs.AI:In order to more effectively cope with the real-world problems of vagueness, {\it fuzzy discrete event systems} (FDESs) were proposed recently, and the supervisory control theory of FDESs was developed. In view of the importance of failure diagnosis, in this paper, we present an approach of the failure diagnosis in the framework of FDESs. More specifically: (1) We formalize the definition of diagnosability for FDESs, in which the observable set and failure set of events are {\it fuzzy}, that is, each event has certain degree to be observable and unobservable, and, also, each event may possess different possibility of failure occurring. (2) Through the construction of observability-based diagnosers of FDESs, we investigate its some basic properties. In particular, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosability of FDESs. (3) Some examples serving to illuminate the applications of the diagnosability of FDESs are described. To conclude, some related issues are raised for further consideration.
cs.AI:Classification of ordinal data is one of the most important tasks of relation learning. In this thesis a novel framework for ordered classes is proposed. The technique reduces the problem of classifying ordered classes to the standard two-class problem. The introduced method is then mapped into support vector machines and neural networks. Compared with a well-known approach using pairwise objects as training samples, the new algorithm has a reduced complexity and training time. A second novel model, the unimodal model, is also introduced and a parametric version is mapped into neural networks. Several case studies are presented to assert the validity of the proposed models.
cs.AI:Imagination is the critical point in developing of realistic artificial intelligence (AI) systems. One way to approach imagination would be simulation of its properties and operations. We developed two models: AI-Brain Network Hierarchy of Languages and Semantical Holographic Calculus as well as simulation system ScriptWriter that emulate the process of imagination through an automatic animation of English texts. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the model and to present ScriptWriter system http://nvo.sdsc.edu/NVO/JCSG/get_SRB_mime_file2.cgi//home/tamara.sdsc/test/demo.zip?F=/home/tamara.sdsc/test/demo.zip&M=application/x-gtar for simulation of the imagination.
cs.AI:In Dempster-Shafer belief theory, general beliefs are expressed as belief mass distribution functions over frames of discernment. In Subjective Logic beliefs are expressed as belief mass distribution functions over binary frames of discernment. Belief representations in Subjective Logic, which are called opinions, also contain a base rate parameter which express the a priori belief in the absence of evidence. Philosophically, beliefs are quantitative representations of evidence as perceived by humans or by other intelligent agents. The basic operators of classical probability calculus, such as addition and multiplication, can be applied to opinions, thereby making belief calculus practical. Through the equivalence between opinions and Beta probability density functions, this also provides a calculus for Beta probability density functions. This article explains the basic elements of belief calculus.
cs.AI:The problem of combining beliefs in the Dempster-Shafer belief theory has attracted considerable attention over the last two decades. The classical Dempster's Rule has often been criticised, and many alternative rules for belief combination have been proposed in the literature. The consensus operator for combining beliefs has nice properties and produces more intuitive results than Dempster's rule, but has the limitation that it can only be applied to belief distribution functions on binary state spaces. In this paper we present a generalisation of the consensus operator that can be applied to Dirichlet belief functions on state spaces of arbitrary size. This rule, called the cumulative rule of belief combination, can be derived from classical statistical theory, and corresponds well with human intuition.
cs.AI:Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently become a real formal science: the new millennium brought the first mathematically sound, asymptotically optimal, universal problem solvers, providing a new, rigorous foundation for the previously largely heuristic field of General AI and embedded agents. At the same time there has been rapid progress in practical methods for learning true sequence-processing programs, as opposed to traditional methods limited to stationary pattern association. Here we will briefly review some of the new results, and speculate about future developments, pointing out that the time intervals between the most notable events in over 40,000 years or 2^9 lifetimes of human history have sped up exponentially, apparently converging to zero within the next few decades. Or is this impression just a by-product of the way humans allocate memory space to past events?
cs.AI:In this paper we propose a new family of Belief Conditioning Rules (BCRs) for belief revision. These rules are not directly related with the fusion of several sources of evidence but with the revision of a belief assignment available at a given time according to the new truth (i.e. conditioning constraint) one has about the space of solutions of the problem.
cs.AI:In this note we introduce the notion of islands for restricting local search. We show how we can construct islands for CNF SAT problems, and how much search space can be eliminated by restricting search to the island.
cs.AI:Knowing the norms of a domain is crucial, but there exist no repository of norms. We propose a method to extract them from texts: texts generally do not describe a norm, but rather how a state-of-affairs differs from it. Answers concerning the cause of the state-of-affairs described often reveal the implicit norm. We apply this idea to the domain of driving, and validate it by designing algorithms that identify, in a text, the "basic" norms to which it refers implicitly.
cs.AI:Norms are essential to extend inference: inferences based on norms are far richer than those based on logical implications. In the recent decades, much effort has been devoted to reason on a domain, once its norms are represented. How to extract and express those norms has received far less attention. Extraction is difficult: as the readers are supposed to know them, the norms of a domain are seldom made explicit. For one thing, extracting norms requires a language to represent them, and this is the topic of this paper. We apply this language to represent norms in the domain of driving, and show that it is adequate to reason on the causes of accidents, as described by car-crash reports.
cs.AI:In this paper we consider and analyze the behavior of two combinational rules for temporal (sequential) attribute data fusion for target type estimation. Our comparative analysis is based on Dempster's fusion rule proposed in Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) and on the Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule no. 5 (PCR5) recently proposed in Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT). We show through very simple scenario and Monte-Carlo simulation, how PCR5 allows a very efficient Target Type Tracking and reduces drastically the latency delay for correct Target Type decision with respect to Demspter's rule. For cases presenting some short Target Type switches, Demspter's rule is proved to be unable to detect the switches and thus to track correctly the Target Type changes. The approach proposed here is totally new, efficient and promising to be incorporated in real-time Generalized Data Association - Multi Target Tracking systems (GDA-MTT) and provides an important result on the behavior of PCR5 with respect to Dempster's rule. The MatLab source code is provided in
cs.AI:This paper introduces the notion of qualitative belief assignment to model beliefs of human experts expressed in natural language (with linguistic labels). We show how qualitative beliefs can be efficiently combined using an extension of Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) of plausible and paradoxical quantitative reasoning to qualitative reasoning. We propose a new arithmetic on linguistic labels which allows a direct extension of classical DSm fusion rule or DSm Hybrid rules. An approximate qualitative PCR5 rule is also proposed jointly with a Qualitative Average Operator. We also show how crisp or interval mappings can be used to deal indirectly with linguistic labels. A very simple example is provided to illustrate our qualitative fusion rules.
cs.AI:The management and combination of uncertain, imprecise, fuzzy and even paradoxical or high conflicting sources of information has always been, and still remains today, of primal importance for the development of reliable modern information systems involving artificial reasoning. In this introduction, we present a survey of our recent theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning, known as Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) in the literature, developed for dealing with imprecise, uncertain and paradoxical sources of information. We focus our presentation here rather on the foundations of DSmT, and on the two important new rules of combination, than on browsing specific applications of DSmT available in literature. Several simple examples are given throughout the presentation to show the efficiency and the generality of this new approach.
cs.AI:We study an alternative to the prevailing approach to modelling qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) problems as constraint satisfaction problems. In the standard approach, a relation between objects is a constraint whereas in the alternative approach it is a variable. The relation-variable approach greatly simplifies integration and implementation of QSR. To substantiate this point, we discuss several QSR algorithms from the literature which in the relation-variable approach reduce to the customary constraint propagation algorithm enforcing generalised arc-consistency.
cs.AI:I explore the use of sets of probability measures as a representation of uncertainty.
cs.AI:We present a state-based regression function for planning domains where an agent does not have complete information and may have sensing actions. We consider binary domains and employ a three-valued characterization of domains with sensing actions to define the regression function. We prove the soundness and completeness of our regression formulation with respect to the definition of progression. More specifically, we show that (i) a plan obtained through regression for a planning problem is indeed a progression solution of that planning problem, and that (ii) for each plan found through progression, using regression one obtains that plan or an equivalent one.
cs.AI:A modification of OWL-S regarding parameter description is proposed. It is strictly based on Description Logic. In addition to class description of parameters it also allows the modelling of relations between parameters and the precise description of the size of data to be supplied to a service. In particular, it solves two major issues identified within current proposals for a Semantic Web Service annotation standard.
cs.AI:The paper describes the ALVIS annotation format designed for the indexing of large collections of documents in topic-specific search engines. This paper is exemplified on the biological domain and on MedLine abstracts, as developing a specialized search engine for biologists is one of the ALVIS case studies. The ALVIS principle for linguistic annotations is based on existing works and standard propositions. We made the choice of stand-off annotations rather than inserted mark-up. Annotations are encoded as XML elements which form the linguistic subsection of the document record.
cs.AI:The aim of this paper is to provide a sound framework for addressing a difficult problem: the automatic construction of an autonomous agent's modular architecture. We combine results from two apparently uncorrelated domains: Autonomous planning through Markov Decision Processes and a General Data Clustering Approach using a kernel-like method. Our fundamental idea is that the former is a good framework for addressing autonomy whereas the latter allows to tackle self-organizing problems.
cs.AI:In this paper we elaborate on a specific application in the context of hybrid description logic programs (hybrid DLPs), namely description logic Semantic Web type systems (DL-types) which are used for term typing of LP rules based on a polymorphic, order-sorted, hybrid DL-typed unification as procedural semantics of hybrid DLPs. Using Semantic Web ontologies as type systems facilitates interchange of domain-independent rules over domain boundaries via dynamically typing and mapping of explicitly defined type ontologies.
cs.AI:In this paper we describe an architecture of a system that answer the question : Why did the accident happen? from the textual description of an accident. We present briefly the different parts of the architecture and then we describe with more detail the semantic part of the system i.e. the part in which the norm-based reasoning is performed on the explicit knowlege extracted from the text.
cs.AI:We develop a system which must be able to perform the same inferences that a human reader of an accident report can do and more particularly to determine the apparent causes of the accident. We describe the general framework in which we are situated, linguistic and semantic levels of the analysis and the inference rules used by the system.
cs.AI:The k-modes algorithm has become a popular technique in solving categorical data clustering problems in different application domains. However, the algorithm requires random selection of initial points for the clusters. Different initial points often lead to considerable distinct clustering results. In this paper we present an experimental study on applying a farthest-point heuristic based initialization method to k-modes clustering to improve its performance. Experiments show that new initialization method leads to better clustering accuracy than random selection initialization method for k-modes clustering.
cs.AI:The opening book is an important component of a chess engine, and thus computer chess programmers have been developing automated methods to improve the quality of their books. For chess, which has a very rich opening theory, large databases of high-quality games can be used as the basis of an opening book, from which statistics relating to move choices from given positions can be collected. In order to find out whether the opening books used by modern chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are ``comparable'' to those used by chess players in human versus human competitions, we carried out analysis on 26 test positions using statistics from two opening books one compiled from humans' games and the other from machines' games. Our analysis using several nonparametric measures, shows that, overall, there is a strong association between humans' and machines' choices of opening moves when using a book to guide their choices.
cs.AI:We present a new local approximation algorithm for computing Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) and log-partition function for arbitrary exponential family distribution represented by a finite-valued pair-wise Markov random field (MRF), say $G$. Our algorithm is based on decomposition of $G$ into {\em appropriately} chosen small components; then computing estimates locally in each of these components and then producing a {\em good} global solution. We show that if the underlying graph $G$ either excludes some finite-sized graph as its minor (e.g. Planar graph) or has low doubling dimension (e.g. any graph with {\em geometry}), then our algorithm will produce solution for both questions within {\em arbitrary accuracy}. We present a message-passing implementation of our algorithm for MAP computation using self-avoiding walk of graph. In order to evaluate the computational cost of this implementation, we derive novel tight bounds on the size of self-avoiding walk tree for arbitrary graph.   As a consequence of our algorithmic result, we show that the normalized log-partition function (also known as free-energy) for a class of {\em regular} MRFs will converge to a limit, that is computable to an arbitrary accuracy.
cs.AI:Creation procedure of associative patterns ensemble in terms of formal logic with using neural net-work (NN) model is formulated. It is shown that the associative patterns set is created by means of unique procedure of NN work which having individual parameters of entrance stimulus transformation. It is ascer-tained that the quantity of the selected associative patterns possesses is a constant.
cs.AI:In case-based reasoning, the adaptation step depends in general on domain-dependent knowledge, which motivates studies on adaptation knowledge acquisition (AKA). CABAMAKA is an AKA system based on principles of knowledge discovery from databases. This system explores the variations within the case base to elicit adaptation knowledge. It has been successfully tested in an application of case-based decision support to breast cancer treatment.
cs.AI:Recently, the diagnosability of {\it stochastic discrete event systems} (SDESs) was investigated in the literature, and, the failure diagnosis considered was {\it centralized}. In this paper, we propose an approach to {\it decentralized} failure diagnosis of SDESs, where the stochastic system uses multiple local diagnosers to detect failures and each local diagnoser possesses its own information. In a way, the centralized failure diagnosis of SDESs can be viewed as a special case of the decentralized failure diagnosis presented in this paper with only one projection. The main contributions are as follows: (1) We formalize the notion of codiagnosability for stochastic automata, which means that a failure can be detected by at least one local stochastic diagnoser within a finite delay. (2) We construct a codiagnoser from a given stochastic automaton with multiple projections, and the codiagnoser associated with the local diagnosers is used to test codiagnosability condition of SDESs. (3) We deal with a number of basic properties of the codiagnoser. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition for the codiagnosability of SDESs is presented. (4) We give a computing method in detail to check whether codiagnosability is violated. And (5) some examples are described to illustrate the applications of the codiagnosability and its computing method.
cs.AI:The management and combination of uncertain, imprecise, fuzzy and even paradoxical or high conflicting sources of information has always been and still remains of primal importance for the development of reliable information fusion systems. In this short survey paper, we present the theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning, known as DSmT (Dezert-Smarandache Theory) in literature, developed for dealing with imprecise, uncertain and potentially highly conflicting sources of information. DSmT is a new paradigm shift for information fusion and recent publications have shown the interest and the potential ability of DSmT to solve fusion problems where Dempster's rule used in Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides counter-intuitive results or fails to provide useful result at all. This paper is focused on the foundations of DSmT and on its main rules of combination (classic, hybrid and Proportional Conflict Redistribution rules). Shafer's model on which is based DST appears as a particular and specific case of DSm hybrid model which can be easily handled by DSmT as well. Several simple but illustrative examples are given throughout this paper to show the interest and the generality of this new theory.
cs.AI:Reaction RuleML is a general, practical, compact and user-friendly XML-serialized language for the family of reaction rules. In this white paper we give a review of the history of event / action /state processing and reaction rule approaches and systems in different domains, define basic concepts and give a classification of the event, action, state processing and reasoning space as well as a discussion of relevant / related work
cs.AI:A fuzzy logic based classification engine has been developed for classifying mass spectra obtained with an imaging internal source Fourier transform mass spectrometer (I^2LD-FTMS). Traditionally, an operator uses the relative abundance of ions with specific mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios to categorize spectra. An operator does this by comparing the spectrum of m/z versus abundance of an unknown sample against a library of spectra from known samples. Automated positioning and acquisition allow I^2LD-FTMS to acquire data from very large grids, this would require classification of up to 3600 spectrum per hour to keep pace with the acquisition. The tedious job of classifying numerous spectra generated in an I^2LD-FTMS imaging application can be replaced by a fuzzy rule base if the cues an operator uses can be encapsulated. We present the translation of linguistic rules to a fuzzy classifier for mineral phases in basalt. This paper also describes a method for gathering statistics on ions, which are not currently used in the rule base, but which may be candidates for making the rule base more accurate and complete or to form new rule bases based on data obtained from known samples. A spatial method for classifying spectra with low membership values, based on neighboring sample classifications, is also presented.
cs.AI:Description Logics (DLs) are appropriate, widely used, logics for managing structured knowledge. They allow reasoning about individuals and concepts, i.e. set of individuals with common properties. Typically, DLs are limited to dealing with crisp, well defined concepts. That is, concepts for which the problem whether an individual is an instance of it is yes/no question. More often than not, the concepts encountered in the real world do not have a precisely defined criteria of membership: we may say that an individual is an instance of a concept only to a certain degree, depending on the individual's properties. The DLs that deal with such fuzzy concepts are called fuzzy DLs. In order to deal with fuzzy, incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent concepts, we need to extend the fuzzy DLs, combining the neutrosophic logic with a classical DL. In particular, concepts become neutrosophic (here neutrosophic means fuzzy, incomplete, indeterminate, and inconsistent), thus reasoning about neutrosophic concepts is supported. We'll define its syntax, its semantics, and describe its properties.
cs.AI:Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are well-established Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. They rely on the fact that i) linear learning can be formalized as a well-posed optimization problem; ii) non-linear learning can be brought into linear learning thanks to the kernel trick and the mapping of the initial search space onto a high dimensional feature space. The kernel is designed by the ML expert and it governs the efficiency of the SVM approach. In this paper, a new approach for the automatic design of kernels by Genetic Programming, called the Evolutionary Kernel Machine (EKM), is presented. EKM combines a well-founded fitness function inspired from the margin criterion, and a co-evolution framework ensuring the computational scalability of the approach. Empirical validation on standard ML benchmark demonstrates that EKM is competitive using state-of-the-art SVMs with tuned hyper-parameters.
cs.AI:Functional brain imaging is a source of spatio-temporal data mining problems. A new framework hybridizing multi-objective and multi-modal optimization is proposed to formalize these data mining problems, and addressed through Evolutionary Computation (EC). The merits of EC for spatio-temporal data mining are demonstrated as the approach facilitates the modelling of the experts' requirements, and flexibly accommodates their changing goals.
cs.AI:The paper suggests the use of Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) as the supporting data structure for a generic global constraint. We give an algorithm for maintaining generalized arc consistency (GAC) on this constraint that amortizes the cost of the GAC computation over a root-to-terminal path in the search tree. The technique used is an extension of the GAC algorithm for the regular language constraint on finite length input. Our approach adds support for skipped variables, maintains the reduced property of the MDD dynamically and provides domain entailment detection. Finally we also show how to adapt the approach to constraint types that are closely related to MDDs, such as AOMDDs and Case DAGs.
cs.AI:Did natural consciousness and intelligent systems arise out of a path that was co-evolutionary to evolution? Can we explain human self-consciousness as having risen out of such an evolutionary path? If so how could it have been?   In this first part of a two-part paper (titled IXI), we take a learning system perspective to the problem of consciousness and intelligent systems, an approach that may look unseasonable in this age of fMRI's and high tech neuroscience.   We posit conscious intelligent systems in natural environments and wonder how natural factors influence their design paths. Such a perspective allows us to explain seamlessly a variety of natural factors, factors ranging from the rise and presence of the human mind, man's sense of I, his self-consciousness and his looping thought processes to factors like reproduction, incubation, extinction, sleep, the richness of natural behavior, etc. It even allows us to speculate on a possible human evolution scenario and other natural phenomena.
cs.AI:This is the second part of a paper on Conscious Intelligent Systems. We use the understanding gained in the first part (Conscious Intelligent Systems Part 1: IXI (arxiv id cs.AI/0612056)) to look at understanding. We see how the presence of mind affects understanding and intelligent systems; we see that the presence of mind necessitates language. The rise of language in turn has important effects on understanding. We discuss the humanoid question and how the question of self-consciousness (and by association mind/thought/language) would affect humanoids too.
cs.AI:A product configurator which is complete, backtrack free and able to compute the valid domains at any state of the configuration can be constructed by building a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD). Despite the fact that the size of the BDD is exponential in the number of variables in the worst case, BDDs have proved to work very well in practice. Current BDD-based techniques can only handle interactive configuration with small finite domains. In this paper we extend the approach to handle string variables constrained by regular expressions. The user is allowed to change the strings by adding letters at the end of the string. We show how to make a data structure that can perform fast valid domain computations given some assignment on the set of string variables.   We first show how to do this by using one large DFA. Since this approach is too space consuming to be of practical use, we construct a data structure that simulates the large DFA and in most practical cases are much more space efficient. As an example a configuration problem on $n$ string variables with only one solution in which each string variable is assigned to a value of length of $k$ the former structure will use $\Omega(k^n)$ space whereas the latter only need $O(kn)$. We also show how this framework easily can be combined with the recent BDD techniques to allow both boolean, integer and string variables in the configuration problem.
cs.AI:Recently, M. Chertkov and V.Y. Chernyak derived an exact expression for the partition sum (normalization constant) corresponding to a graphical model, which is an expansion around the Belief Propagation solution. By adding correction terms to the BP free energy, one for each "generalized loop" in the factor graph, the exact partition sum is obtained. However, the usually enormous number of generalized loops generally prohibits summation over all correction terms. In this article we introduce Truncated Loop Series BP (TLSBP), a particular way of truncating the loop series of M. Chertkov and V.Y. Chernyak by considering generalized loops as compositions of simple loops. We analyze the performance of TLSBP in different scenarios, including the Ising model, regular random graphs and on Promedas, a large probabilistic medical diagnostic system. We show that TLSBP often improves upon the accuracy of the BP solution, at the expense of increased computation time. We also show that the performance of TLSBP strongly depends on the degree of interaction between the variables. For weak interactions, truncating the series leads to significant improvements, whereas for strong interactions it can be ineffective, even if a high number of terms is considered.
cs.AI:In this paper, the traditional k-modes clustering algorithm is extended by weighting attribute value matches in dissimilarity computation. The use of attribute value weighting technique makes it possible to generate clusters with stronger intra-similarities, and therefore achieve better clustering performance. Experimental results on real life datasets show that these value weighting based k-modes algorithms are superior to the standard k-modes algorithm with respect to clustering accuracy.
cs.AI:In Verification and in (optimal) AI Planning, a successful method is to formulate the application as boolean satisfiability (SAT), and solve it with state-of-the-art DPLL-based procedures. There is a lack of understanding of why this works so well. Focussing on the Planning context, we identify a form of problem structure concerned with the symmetrical or asymmetrical nature of the cost of achieving the individual planning goals. We quantify this sort of structure with a simple numeric parameter called AsymRatio, ranging between 0 and 1. We run experiments in 10 benchmark domains from the International Planning Competitions since 2000; we show that AsymRatio is a good indicator of SAT solver performance in 8 of these domains. We then examine carefully crafted synthetic planning domains that allow control of the amount of structure, and that are clean enough for a rigorous analysis of the combinatorial search space. The domains are parameterized by size, and by the amount of structure. The CNFs we examine are unsatisfiable, encoding one planning step less than the length of the optimal plan. We prove upper and lower bounds on the size of the best possible DPLL refutations, under different settings of the amount of structure, as a function of size. We also identify the best possible sets of branching variables (backdoors). With minimum AsymRatio, we prove exponential lower bounds, and identify minimal backdoors of size linear in the number of variables. With maximum AsymRatio, we identify logarithmic DPLL refutations (and backdoors), showing a doubly exponential gap between the two structural extreme cases. The reasons for this behavior -- the proof arguments -- illuminate the prototypical patterns of structure causing the empirical behavior observed in the competition benchmarks.
cs.AI:This short paper introduces two new fusion rules for combining quantitative basic belief assignments. These rules although very simple have not been proposed in literature so far and could serve as useful alternatives because of their low computation cost with respect to the recent advanced Proportional Conflict Redistribution rules developed in the DSmT framework.
cs.AI:Constraint Programming (CP) has been successfully applied to both constraint satisfaction and constraint optimization problems. A wide variety of specialized global constraints provide critical assistance in achieving a good model that can take advantage of the structure of the problem in the search for a solution. However, a key outstanding issue is the representation of 'ad-hoc' constraints that do not have an inherent combinatorial nature, and hence are not modeled well using narrowly specialized global constraints. We attempt to address this issue by considering a hybrid of search and compilation. Specifically we suggest the use of Reduced Ordered Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (ROMDDs) as the supporting data structure for a generic global constraint. We give an algorithm for maintaining generalized arc consistency (GAC) on this constraint that amortizes the cost of the GAC computation over a root-to-leaf path in the search tree without requiring asymptotically more space than used for the MDD. Furthermore we present an approach for incrementally maintaining the reduced property of the MDD during the search, and show how this can be used for providing domain entailment detection. Finally we discuss how to apply our approach to other similar data structures such as AOMDDs and Case DAGs. The technique used can be seen as an extension of the GAC algorithm for the regular language constraint on finite length input.
cs.AI:For academics and practitioners concerned with computers, business and mathematics, one central issue is supporting decision makers. In this paper, we propose a generalization of Decision Matrix Method (DMM), using Neutrosophic logic. It emerges as an alternative to the existing logics and it represents a mathematical model of uncertainty and indeterminacy. This paper proposes the Neutrosophic Decision Matrix Method as a more realistic tool for decision making. In addition, a de-neutrosophication process is included.
cs.AI:This paper constructs a tree structure for the music rhythm using the L-system. It models the structure as an automata and derives its complexity. It also solves the complexity for the L-system. This complexity can resolve the similarity between trees. This complexity serves as a measure of psychological complexity for rhythms. It resolves the music complexity of various compositions including the Mozart effect K488.   Keyword: music perception, psychological complexity, rhythm, L-system, automata, temporal associative memory, inverse problem, rewriting rule, bracketed string, tree similarity
cs.AI:Using qualitative reasoning with geographic information, contrarily, for instance, with robotics, looks not only fastidious (i.e.: encoding knowledge Propositional Logics PL), but appears to be computational complex, and not tractable at all, most of the time. However, knowledge fusion or revision, is a common operation performed when users merge several different data sets in a unique decision making process, without much support. Introducing logics would be a great improvement, and we propose in this paper, means for deciding -a priori- if one application can benefit from a complete revision, under only the assumption of a conjecture that we name the "containment conjecture", which limits the size of the minimal conflicts to revise. We demonstrate that this conjecture brings us the interesting computational property of performing a not-provable but global, revision, made of many local revisions, at a tractable size. We illustrate this approach on an application.
cs.AI:In case-based reasoning, the adaptation of a source case in order to solve the target problem is at the same time crucial and difficult to implement. The reason for this difficulty is that, in general, adaptation strongly depends on domain-dependent knowledge. This fact motivates research on adaptation knowledge acquisition (AKA). This paper presents an approach to AKA based on the principles and techniques of knowledge discovery from databases and data-mining. It is implemented in CABAMAKA, a system that explores the variations within the case base to elicit adaptation knowledge. This system has been successfully tested in an application of case-based reasoning to decision support in the domain of breast cancer treatment.
cs.AI:In these notes we formally describe the functionality of Calculating Valid Domains from the BDD representing the solution space of valid configurations. The formalization is largely based on the CLab configuration framework.
cs.AI:Motivation: Profile hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are a popular and very useful tool in the detection of the remote homologue protein families. Unfortunately, their performance is not always satisfactory when proteins are in the 'twilight zone'. We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm and tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information while training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs. Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein according to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing. HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out cross-validation over protein superfamilies. First, we used the MAMMOTH-mult structural aligner to align the training set proteins. Then, we performed two sets of experiments. In a first experiment, we compared structure weighted models against standard pHMMs and against each other. In a second experiment, we compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method performance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess significance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant performance improvements of all structurally weighted models over default HMMER, and a significant improvement in sensitivity of the combined models over both the original model and the structurally weighted models.
cs.AI:This paper proposes an approach to training rough set models using Bayesian framework trained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The prior probabilities are constructed from the prior knowledge that good rough set models have fewer rules. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is conducted through sampling in the rough set granule space and Metropolis algorithm is used as an acceptance criteria. The proposed method is tested to estimate the risk of HIV given demographic data. The results obtained shows that the proposed approach is able to achieve an average accuracy of 58% with the accuracy varying up to 66%. In addition the Bayesian rough set give the probabilities of the estimated HIV status as well as the linguistic rules describing how the demographic parameters drive the risk of HIV.
cs.AI:Noise, corruptions and variations in face images can seriously hurt the performance of face recognition systems. To make such systems robust, multiclass neuralnetwork classifiers capable of learning from noisy data have been suggested. However on large face data sets such systems cannot provide the robustness at a high level. In this paper we explore a pairwise neural-network system as an alternative approach to improving the robustness of face recognition. In our experiments this approach is shown to outperform the multiclass neural-network system in terms of the predictive accuracy on the face images corrupted by noise.
cs.AI:Evolutionary Learning proceeds by evolving a population of classifiers, from which it generally returns (with some notable exceptions) the single best-of-run classifier as final result. In the meanwhile, Ensemble Learning, one of the most efficient approaches in supervised Machine Learning for the last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (Off-line) or incrementally along evolution (On-line). Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that Off-line outperforms single-hypothesis evolutionary learning and state-of-art Boosting and generates smaller classifier ensembles.
cs.AI:Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and support vector machines (SVM) are introduced to classify faults in a population of cylindrical shells. The proposed procedures are tested on a population of 20 cylindrical shells and their performance is compared to the procedure, which uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). The modal properties extracted from vibration data are used to train the GMM, SVM and MLP. It is observed that the GMM produces 98%, SVM produces 94% classification accuracy while the MLP produces 88% classification rates.
cs.AI:The act of bluffing confounds game designers to this day. The very nature of bluffing is even open for debate, adding further complication to the process of creating intelligent virtual players that can bluff, and hence play, realistically. Through the use of intelligent, learning agents, and carefully designed agent outlooks, an agent can in fact learn to predict its opponents reactions based not only on its own cards, but on the actions of those around it. With this wider scope of understanding, an agent can in learn to bluff its opponents, with the action representing not an illogical action, as bluffing is often viewed, but rather as an act of maximising returns through an effective statistical optimisation. By using a tee dee lambda learning algorithm to continuously adapt neural network agent intelligence, agents have been shown to be able to learn to bluff without outside prompting, and even to learn to call each others bluffs in free, competitive play.
cs.AI:The semiring-based constraint satisfaction problems (semiring CSPs), proposed by Bistarelli, Montanari and Rossi \cite{BMR97}, is a very general framework of soft constraints. In this paper we propose an abstraction scheme for soft constraints that uses semiring homomorphism. To find optimal solutions of the concrete problem, the idea is, first working in the abstract problem and finding its optimal solutions, then using them to solve the concrete problem.   In particular, we show that a mapping preserves optimal solutions if and only if it is an order-reflecting semiring homomorphism. Moreover, for a semiring homomorphism $\alpha$ and a problem $P$ over $S$, if $t$ is optimal in $\alpha(P)$, then there is an optimal solution $\bar{t}$ of $P$ such that $\bar{t}$ has the same value as $t$ in $\alpha(P)$.
cs.AI:This paper proposes a neuro-rough model based on multi-layered perceptron and rough set. The neuro-rough model is then tested on modelling the risk of HIV from demographic data. The model is formulated using Bayesian framework and trained using Monte Carlo method and Metropolis criterion. When the model was tested to estimate the risk of HIV infection given the demographic data it was found to give the accuracy of 62%. The proposed model is able to combine the accuracy of the Bayesian MLP model and the transparency of Bayesian rough set model.
cs.AI:Water plays a pivotal role in many physical processes, and most importantly in sustaining human life, animal life and plant life. Water supply entities therefore have the responsibility to supply clean and safe water at the rate required by the consumer. It is therefore necessary to implement mechanisms and systems that can be employed to predict both short-term and long-term water demands. The increasingly growing field of computational intelligence techniques has been proposed as an efficient tool in the modelling of dynamic phenomena. The primary objective of this paper is to compare the efficiency of two computational intelligence techniques in water demand forecasting. The techniques under comparison are the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and the Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this study it was observed that the ANNs perform better than the SVMs. This performance is measured against the generalisation ability of the two.
cs.AI:An ensemble based approach for dealing with missing data, without predicting or imputing the missing values is proposed. This technique is suitable for online operations of neural networks and as a result, is used for online condition monitoring. The proposed technique is tested in both classification and regression problems. An ensemble of Fuzzy-ARTMAPs is used for classification whereas an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons is used for the regression problem. Results obtained using this ensemble-based technique are compared to those obtained using a combination of auto-associative neural networks and genetic algorithms and findings show that this method can perform up to 9% better in regression problems. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that it eliminates the need for finding the best estimate of the data, and hence, saves time.
cs.AI:Militarised conflict is one of the risks that have a significant impact on society. Militarised Interstate Dispute (MID) is defined as an outcome of interstate interactions, which result on either peace or conflict. Effective prediction of the possibility of conflict between states is an important decision support tool for policy makers. In a previous research, neural networks (NNs) have been implemented to predict the MID. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have proven to be very good prediction techniques and are introduced for the prediction of MIDs in this study and compared to neural networks. The results show that SVMs predict MID better than NNs while NNs give more consistent and easy to interpret sensitivity analysis than SVMs.
cs.AI:The idea of symbolic controllers tries to bridge the gap between the top-down manual design of the controller architecture, as advocated in Brooks' subsumption architecture, and the bottom-up designer-free approach that is now standard within the Evolutionary Robotics community. The designer provides a set of elementary behavior, and evolution is given the goal of assembling them to solve complex tasks. Two experiments are presented, demonstrating the efficiency and showing the recursiveness of this approach. In particular, the sensitivity with respect to the proposed elementary behaviors, and the robustness w.r.t. generalization of the resulting controllers are studied in detail.
cs.AI:This paper introduces a continuous model for Multi-cellular Developmental Design. The cells are fixed on a 2D grid and exchange "chemicals" with their neighbors during the growth process. The quantity of chemicals that a cell produces, as well as the differentiation value of the cell in the phenotype, are controlled by a Neural Network (the genotype) that takes as inputs the chemicals produced by the neighboring cells at the previous time step. In the proposed model, the number of iterations of the growth process is not pre-determined, but emerges during evolution: only organisms for which the growth process stabilizes give a phenotype (the stable state), others are declared nonviable. The optimization of the controller is done using the NEAT algorithm, that optimizes both the topology and the weights of the Neural Networks. Though each cell only receives local information from its neighbors, the experimental results of the proposed approach on the 'flags' problems (the phenotype must match a given 2D pattern) are almost as good as those of a direct regression approach using the same model with global information. Moreover, the resulting multi-cellular organisms exhibit almost perfect self-healing characteristics.
cs.AI:This paper uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to compute response of structural system subject to Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi ground motion data. The system is first trained for a single real earthquake data. The trained ANN architecture is then used to simulate earthquakes with various intensities and it was found that the predicted responses given by ANN model are accurate for practical purposes. When the ANN is trained by a part of the ground motion data, it can also identify the responses of the structural system well. In this way the safeness of the structural systems may be predicted in case of future earthquakes without waiting for the earthquake to occur for the lessons. Time period and the corresponding maximum response of the building for an earthquake has been evaluated, which is again trained to predict the maximum response of the building at different time periods. The trained time period versus maximum response ANN model is also tested for real earthquake data of other place, which was not used in the training and was found to be in good agreement.
cs.AI:This paper presents a fault classification method which makes use of a Takagi-Sugeno neuro-fuzzy model and Pseudomodal energies calculated from the vibration signals of cylindrical shells. The calculation of Pseudomodal Energies, for the purposes of condition monitoring, has previously been found to be an accurate method of extracting features from vibration signals. This calculation is therefore used to extract features from vibration signals obtained from a diverse population of cylindrical shells. Some of the cylinders in the population have faults in different substructures. The pseudomodal energies calculated from the vibration signals are then used as inputs to a neuro-fuzzy model. A leave-one-out cross-validation process is used to test the performance of the model. It is found that the neuro-fuzzy model is able to classify faults with an accuracy of 91.62%, which is higher than the previously used multilayer perceptron.
cs.AI:This paper presents bushing condition monitoring frameworks that use multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), radial basis functions (RBF) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers. The first level of the framework determines if the bushing is faulty or not while the second level determines the type of fault. The diagnostic gases in the bushings are analyzed using the dissolve gas analysis. MLP gives superior performance in terms of accuracy and training time than SVM and RBF. In addition, an on-line bushing condition monitoring approach, which is able to adapt to newly acquired data are introduced. This approach is able to accommodate new classes that are introduced by incoming data and is implemented using an incremental learning algorithm that uses MLP. The testing results improved from 67.5% to 95.8% as new data were introduced and the testing results improved from 60% to 95.3% as new conditions were introduced. On average the confidence value of the framework on its decision was 0.92.
cs.AI:This paper overviews the basic principles and recent advances in the emerging field of Quantum Computation (QC), highlighting its potential application to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The paper provides a very brief introduction to basic QC issues like quantum registers, quantum gates and quantum algorithms and then it presents references, ideas and research guidelines on how QC can be used to deal with some basic AI problems, such as search and pattern matching, as soon as quantum computers become widely available.
cs.AI:Cluster matching by permuting cluster labels is important in many clustering contexts such as cluster validation and cluster ensemble techniques. The classic approach is to minimize the euclidean distance between two cluster solutions which induces inappropriate stability in certain settings. Therefore, we present the truematch algorithm that introduces two improvements best explained in the crisp case. First, instead of maximizing the trace of the cluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this crosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest counts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into account the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to break ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The truematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster framework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that the truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal cluster sizes. Free R software is available.
cs.AI:Semantic network research has seen a resurgence from its early history in the cognitive sciences with the inception of the Semantic Web initiative. The Semantic Web effort has brought forth an array of technologies that support the encoding, storage, and querying of the semantic network data structure at the world stage. Currently, the popular conception of the Semantic Web is that of a data modeling medium where real and conceptual entities are related in semantically meaningful ways. However, new models have emerged that explicitly encode procedural information within the semantic network substrate. With these new technologies, the Semantic Web has evolved from a data modeling medium to a computational medium. This article provides a classification of existing computational modeling efforts and the requirements of supporting technologies that will aid in the further growth of this burgeoning domain.
cs.AI:This paper describes a system capable of semi-automatically filling an XML template from free texts in the clinical domain (practice guidelines). The XML template includes semantic information not explicitly encoded in the text (pairs of conditions and actions/recommendations). Therefore, there is a need to compute the exact scope of conditions over text sequences expressing the required actions. We present a system developed for this task. We show that it yields good performance when applied to the analysis of French practice guidelines.
cs.AI:Representing and reasoning about qualitative temporal information is an essential part of many artificial intelligence tasks. Lots of models have been proposed in the litterature for representing such temporal information. All derive from a point-based or an interval-based framework. One fundamental reasoning task that arises in applications of these frameworks is given by the following scheme: given possibly indefinite and incomplete knowledge of the binary relationships between some temporal objects, find the consistent scenarii between all these objects. All these models require transitive tables -- or similarly inference rules-- for solving such tasks. We have defined an alternative model, S-languages - to represent qualitative temporal information, based on the only two relations of \emph{precedence} and \emph{simultaneity}. In this paper, we show how this model enables to avoid transitive tables or inference rules to handle this kind of problem.
cs.AI:This paper is a survey of a large number of informal definitions of ``intelligence'' that the authors have collected over the years. Naturally, compiling a complete list would be impossible as many definitions of intelligence are buried deep inside articles and books. Nevertheless, the 70-odd definitions presented here are, to the authors' knowledge, the largest and most well referenced collection there is.
cs.AI:Web semantic access in specific domains calls for specialized search engines with enhanced semantic querying and indexing capacities, which pertain both to information retrieval (IR) and to information extraction (IE). A rich linguistic analysis is required either to identify the relevant semantic units to index and weight them according to linguistic specific statistical distribution, or as the basis of an information extraction process. Recent developments make Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques reliable enough to process large collections of documents and to enrich them with semantic annotations. This paper focuses on the design and the development of a text processing platform, Ogmios, which has been developed in the ALVIS project. The Ogmios platform exploits existing NLP modules and resources, which may be tuned to specific domains and produces linguistically annotated documents. We show how the three constraints of genericity, domain semantic awareness and performance can be handled all together.
cs.AI:We consider the problem of finding an n-agent joint-policy for the optimal finite-horizon control of a decentralized Pomdp (Dec-Pomdp). This is a problem of very high complexity (NEXP-hard in n >= 2). In this paper, we propose a new mathematical programming approach for the problem. Our approach is based on two ideas: First, we represent each agent's policy in the sequence-form and not in the tree-form, thereby obtaining a very compact representation of the set of joint-policies. Second, using this compact representation, we solve this problem as an instance of combinatorial optimization for which we formulate a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The optimal solution of the MILP directly yields an optimal joint-policy for the Dec-Pomdp. Computational experience shows that formulating and solving the MILP requires significantly less time to solve benchmark Dec-Pomdp problems than existing algorithms. For example, the multi-agent tiger problem for horizon 4 is solved in 72 secs with the MILP whereas existing algorithms require several hours to solve it.
cs.AI:In this paper, we employ Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) with image and data processing techniques to implement a general purpose automated leaf recognition algorithm. 12 leaf features are extracted and orthogonalized into 5 principal variables which consist the input vector of the PNN. The PNN is trained by 1800 leaves to classify 32 kinds of plants with an accuracy greater than 90%. Compared with other approaches, our algorithm is an accurate artificial intelligence approach which is fast in execution and easy in implementation.
cs.AI:When Kurt Goedel layed the foundations of theoretical computer science in 1931, he also introduced essential concepts of the theory of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although much of subsequent AI research has focused on heuristics, which still play a major role in many practical AI applications, in the new millennium AI theory has finally become a full-fledged formal science, with important optimality results for embodied agents living in unknown environments, obtained through a combination of theory a la Goedel and probability theory. Here we look back at important milestones of AI history, mention essential recent results, and speculate about what we may expect from the next 25 years, emphasizing the significance of the ongoing dramatic hardware speedups, and discussing Goedel-inspired, self-referential, self-improving universal problem solvers.
cs.AI:In this paper we extend the new family of (quantitative) Belief Conditioning Rules (BCR) recently developed in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) to their qualitative counterpart for belief revision. Since the revision of quantitative as well as qualitative belief assignment given the occurrence of a new event (the conditioning constraint) can be done in many possible ways, we present here only what we consider as the most appealing Qualitative Belief Conditioning Rules (QBCR) which allow to revise the belief directly with words and linguistic labels and thus avoids the introduction of ad-hoc translations of quantitative beliefs into quantitative ones for solving the problem.
cs.AI:Many systems can be described in terms of networks of discrete elements and their various relationships to one another. A semantic network, or multi-relational network, is a directed labeled graph consisting of a heterogeneous set of entities connected by a heterogeneous set of relationships. Semantic networks serve as a promising general-purpose modeling substrate for complex systems. Various standardized formats and tools are now available to support practical, large-scale semantic network models. First, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) offers a standardized semantic network data model that can be further formalized by ontology modeling languages such as RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the recent introduction of highly performant triple-stores (i.e. semantic network databases) allows semantic network models on the order of $10^9$ edges to be efficiently stored and manipulated. RDF and its related technologies are currently used extensively in the domains of computer science, digital library science, and the biological sciences. This article will provide an introduction to RDF/RDFS/OWL and an examination of its suitability to model discrete element complex systems.
cs.AI:This paper deals with enriched qualitative belief functions for reasoning under uncertainty and for combining information expressed in natural language through linguistic labels. In this work, two possible enrichments (quantitative and/or qualitative) of linguistic labels are considered and operators (addition, multiplication, division, etc) for dealing with them are proposed and explained. We denote them $qe$-operators, $qe$ standing for "qualitative-enriched" operators. These operators can be seen as a direct extension of the classical qualitative operators ($q$-operators) proposed recently in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory of plausible and paradoxist reasoning (DSmT). $q$-operators are also justified in details in this paper. The quantitative enrichment of linguistic label is a numerical supporting degree in $[0,\infty)$, while the qualitative enrichment takes its values in a finite ordered set of linguistic values. Quantitative enrichment is less precise than qualitative enrichment, but it is expected more close with what human experts can easily provide when expressing linguistic labels with supporting degrees. Two simple examples are given to show how the fusion of qualitative-enriched belief assignments can be done.
cs.AI:We try to perform geometrization of psychology by representing mental states, <<ideas>>, by points of a metric space, <<mental space>>. Evolution of ideas is described by dynamical systems in metric mental space. We apply the mental space approach for modeling of flows of unconscious and conscious information in the human brain. In a series of models, Models 1-4, we consider cognitive systems with increasing complexity of psychological behavior determined by structure of flows of ideas. Since our models are in fact models of the AI-type, one immediately recognizes that they can be used for creation of AI-systems, which we call psycho-robots, exhibiting important elements of human psyche. Creation of such psycho-robots may be useful improvement of domestic robots. At the moment domestic robots are merely simple working devices (e.g. vacuum cleaners or lawn mowers) . However, in future one can expect demand in systems which be able not only perform simple work tasks, but would have elements of human self-developing psyche. Such AI-psyche could play an important role both in relations between psycho-robots and their owners as well as between psycho-robots. Since the presence of a huge numbers of psycho-complexes is an essential characteristic of human psychology, it would be interesting to model them in the AI-framework.
cs.AI:In this paper we study cellular automata (CAs) that perform the computational Majority task. This task is a good example of what the phenomenon of emergence in complex systems is. We take an interest in the reasons that make this particular fitness landscape a difficult one. The first goal is to study the landscape as such, and thus it is ideally independent from the actual heuristics used to search the space. However, a second goal is to understand the features a good search technique for this particular problem space should possess. We statistically quantify in various ways the degree of difficulty of searching this landscape. Due to neutrality, investigations based on sampling techniques on the whole landscape are difficult to conduct. So, we go exploring the landscape from the top. Although it has been proved that no CA can perform the task perfectly, several efficient CAs for this task have been found. Exploiting similarities between these CAs and symmetries in the landscape, we define the Olympus landscape which is regarded as the ''heavenly home'' of the best local optima known (blok). Then we measure several properties of this subspace. Although it is easier to find relevant CAs in this subspace than in the overall landscape, there are structural reasons that prevent a searcher from finding overfitted CAs in the Olympus. Finally, we study dynamics and performance of genetic algorithms on the Olympus in order to confirm our analysis and to find efficient CAs for the Majority problem with low computational cost.
cs.AI:This paper introduces the concept of fitness cloud as an alternative way to visualize and analyze search spaces than given by the geographic notion of fitness landscape. It is argued that the fitness cloud concept overcomes several deficiencies of the landscape representation. Our analysis is based on the correlation between fitness of solutions and fitnesses of nearest solutions according to some neighboring. We focus on the behavior of local search heuristics, such as hill climber, on the well-known NK fitness landscape. In both cases the fitness vs. fitness correlation is shown to be related to the epistatic parameter K.
cs.AI:This theoretical work defines the measure of autocorrelation of evolvability in the context of neutral fitness landscape. This measure has been studied on the classical MAX-SAT problem. This work highlight a new characteristic of neutral fitness landscapes which allows to design new adapted metaheuristic.
cs.AI:This paper describes a system capable of semi-automatically filling an XML template from free texts in the clinical domain (practice guidelines). The XML template includes semantic information not explicitly encoded in the text (pairs of conditions and actions/recommendations). Therefore, there is a need to compute the exact scope of conditions over text sequences expressing the required actions. We present in this paper the rules developed for this task. We show that the system yields good performance when applied to the analysis of French practice guidelines.
cs.AI:We develop a general framework for MAP estimation in discrete and Gaussian graphical models using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. The key idea is to reformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more tractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these constraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which is then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization leads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then it corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise there is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution. Thus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming techniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product (TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations, where the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also consider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g. loops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we propose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary'' variables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or eliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or Lagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the iterative optimization procedure.
cs.AI:This paper addresses a method to analyze the covert social network foundation hidden behind the terrorism disaster. It is to solve a node discovery problem, which means to discover a node, which functions relevantly in a social network, but escaped from monitoring on the presence and mutual relationship of nodes. The method aims at integrating the expert investigator's prior understanding, insight on the terrorists' social network nature derived from the complex graph theory, and computational data processing. The social network responsible for the 9/11 attack in 2001 is used to execute simulation experiment to evaluate the performance of the method.
cs.AI:Methods to solve a node discovery problem for a social network are presented. Covert nodes refer to the nodes which are not observable directly. They transmit the influence and affect the resulting collaborative activities among the persons in a social network, but do not appear in the surveillance logs which record the participants of the collaborative activities. Discovering the covert nodes is identifying the suspicious logs where the covert nodes would appear if the covert nodes became overt. The performance of the methods is demonstrated with a test dataset generated from computationally synthesized networks and a real organization.
cs.AI:An empty spot refers to an empty hard-to-fill space which can be found in the records of the social interaction, and is the clue to the persons in the underlying social network who do not appear in the records. This contribution addresses a problem to predict relevant empty spots in social interaction. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks are studied as a model underlying the social interaction. A heuristic predictor function approach is presented as a new method to address the problem. Simulation experiment is demonstrated over a homogeneous network. A test data in the form of baskets is generated from the simulated communication. Precision to predict the empty spots is calculated to demonstrate the performance of the presented approach.
cs.AI:To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), 2008.   We are researching the interaction between the rule and the ontology layers of the Semantic Web, by comparing two options: 1) using OWL and its rule extension SWRL to develop an integrated ontology/rule language, and 2) layering rules on top of an ontology with RuleML and OWL. Toward this end, we are developing the SWORIER system, which enables efficient automated reasoning on ontologies and rules, by translating all of them into Prolog and adding a set of general rules that properly capture the semantics of OWL. We have also enabled the user to make dynamic changes on the fly, at run time. This work addresses several of the concerns expressed in previous work, such as negation, complementary classes, disjunctive heads, and cardinality, and it discusses alternative approaches for dealing with inconsistencies in the knowledge base. In addition, for efficiency, we implemented techniques called extensionalization, avoiding reanalysis, and code minimization.
cs.AI:We consider hexagonal cellular automata with immediate cell neighbourhood and three cell-states. Every cell calculates its next state depending on the integral representation of states in its neighbourhood, i.e. how many neighbours are in each one state. We employ evolutionary algorithms to breed local transition functions that support mobile localizations (gliders), and characterize sets of the functions selected in terms of quasi-chemical systems. Analysis of the set of functions evolved allows to speculate that mobile localizations are likely to emerge in the quasi-chemical systems with limited diffusion of one reagent, a small number of molecules is required for amplification of travelling localizations, and reactions leading to stationary localizations involve relatively equal amount of quasi-chemical species. Techniques developed can be applied in cascading signals in nature-inspired spatially extended computing devices, and phenomenological studies and classification of non-linear discrete systems.
cs.AI:We describe decomposition during search (DDS), an integration of And/Or tree search into propagation-based constraint solvers. The presented search algorithm dynamically decomposes sub-problems of a constraint satisfaction problem into independent partial problems, avoiding redundant work.   The paper discusses how DDS interacts with key features that make propagation-based solvers successful: constraint propagation, especially for global constraints, and dynamic search heuristics.   We have implemented DDS for the Gecode constraint programming library. Two applications, solution counting in graph coloring and protein structure prediction, exemplify the benefits of DDS in practice.
cs.AI:A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is related to the theory of universal optimal learning agents. Finally, we survey the many other tests and definitions of intelligence that have been proposed for machines.
cs.AI:Although the definition and measurement of intelligence is clearly of fundamental importance to the field of artificial intelligence, no general survey of definitions and tests of machine intelligence exists. Indeed few researchers are even aware of alternatives to the Turing test and its many derivatives. In this paper we fill this gap by providing a short survey of the many tests of machine intelligence that have been proposed.
cs.AI:We consider an agent interacting with an unknown environment. The environment is a function which maps natural numbers to natural numbers; the agent's set of hypotheses about the environment contains all such functions which are computable and compatible with a finite set of known input-output pairs, and the agent assigns a positive probability to each such hypothesis. We do not require that this probability distribution be computable, but it must be bounded below by a positive computable function. The agent has a utility function on outputs from the environment. We show that if this utility function is bounded below in absolute value by an unbounded computable function, then the expected utility of any input is undefined. This implies that a computable utility function will have convergent expected utilities iff that function is bounded.
cs.AI:Most definitions of ontology, viewed as a "specification of a conceptualization", agree on the fact that if an ontology can take different forms, it necessarily includes a vocabulary of terms and some specification of their meaning in relation to the domain's conceptualization. And as domain knowledge is mainly conveyed through scientific and technical texts, we can hope to extract some useful information from them for building ontology. But is it as simple as this? In this article we shall see that the lexical structure, i.e. the network of words linked by linguistic relationships, does not necessarily match the domain conceptualization. We have to bear in mind that writing documents is the concern of textual linguistics, of which one of the principles is the incompleteness of text, whereas building ontology - viewed as task-independent knowledge - is concerned with conceptualization based on formal and not natural languages. Nevertheless, the famous Sapir and Whorf hypothesis, concerning the interdependence of thought and language, is also applicable to formal languages. This means that the way an ontology is built and a concept is defined depends directly on the formal language which is used; and the results will not be the same. The introduction of the notion of ontoterminology allows to take into account epistemological principles for formal ontology building.
cs.AI:Stream computing is the use of multiple autonomic and parallel modules together with integrative processors at a higher level of abstraction to embody "intelligent" processing. The biological basis of this computing is sketched and the matter of learning is examined.
cs.AI:In this paper we introduce a new selection scheme in cellular genetic algorithms (cGAs). Anisotropic Selection (AS) promotes diversity and allows accurate control of the selective pressure. First we compare this new scheme with the classical rectangular grid shapes solution according to the selective pressure: we can obtain the same takeover time with the two techniques although the spreading of the best individual is different. We then give experimental results that show to what extent AS promotes the emergence of niches that support low coupling and high cohesion. Finally, using a cGA with anisotropic selection on a Quadratic Assignment Problem we show the existence of an anisotropic optimal value for which the best average performance is observed. Further work will focus on the selective pressure self-adjustment ability provided by this new selection scheme.
cs.AI:This philosophical paper explores the relation between modern scientific simulations and the future of the universe. We argue that a simulation of an entire universe will result from future scientific activity. This requires us to tackle the challenge of simulating open-ended evolution at all levels in a single simulation. The simulation should encompass not only biological evolution, but also physical evolution (a level below) and cultural evolution (a level above). The simulation would allow us to probe what would happen if we would "replay the tape of the universe" with the same or different laws and initial conditions. We also distinguish between real-world and artificial-world modelling. Assuming that intelligent life could indeed simulate an entire universe, this leads to two tentative hypotheses. Some authors have argued that we may already be in a simulation run by an intelligent entity. Or, if such a simulation could be made real, this would lead to the production of a new universe. This last direction is argued with a careful speculative philosophical approach, emphasizing the imperative to find a solution to the heat death problem in cosmology. The reader is invited to consult Annex 1 for an overview of the logical structure of this paper. -- Keywords: far future, future of science, ALife, simulation, realization, cosmology, heat death, fine-tuning, physical eschatology, cosmological natural selection, cosmological artificial selection, artificial cosmogenesis, selfish biocosm hypothesis, meduso-anthropic principle, developmental singularity hypothesis, role of intelligent life.
cs.AI:This paper has been withdrawn.
cs.AI:In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that consists in combining an eye-tracker for minimizing the fatigue of a user during the evaluation process of Interactive Evolutionary Computation. The approach is then applied to the Interactive One-Max optimization problem.
cs.AI:In this paper, I present a method to solve a node discovery problem in a networked organization. Covert nodes refer to the nodes which are not observable directly. They affect social interactions, but do not appear in the surveillance logs which record the participants of the social interactions. Discovering the covert nodes is defined as identifying the suspicious logs where the covert nodes would appear if the covert nodes became overt. A mathematical model is developed for the maximal likelihood estimation of the network behind the social interactions and for the identification of the suspicious logs. Precision, recall, and F measure characteristics are demonstrated with the dataset generated from a real organization and the computationally synthesized datasets. The performance is close to the theoretical limit for any covert nodes in the networks of any topologies and sizes if the ratio of the number of observation to the number of possible communication patterns is large.
cs.AI:In an emergency situation, the actors need an assistance allowing them to react swiftly and efficiently. In this prospect, we present in this paper a decision support system that aims to prepare actors in a crisis situation thanks to a decision-making support. The global architecture of this system is presented in the first part. Then we focus on a part of this system which is designed to represent the information of the current situation. This part is composed of a multiagent system that is made of factual agents. Each agent carries a semantic feature and aims to represent a partial part of a situation. The agents develop thanks to their interactions by comparing their semantic features using proximity measures and according to specific ontologies.
cs.AI:A new method is presented, that can help a person become aware of his or her unconscious preferences, and convey them to others in the form of verbal explanation. The method combines the concepts of reflection, visualization, and verbalization. The method was tested in an experiment where the unconscious preferences of the subjects for various artworks were investigated. In the experiment, two lessons were learned. The first is that it helps the subjects become aware of their unconscious preferences to verbalize weak preferences as compared with strong preferences through discussion over preference diagrams. The second is that it is effective to introduce an adjustable factor into visualization to adapt to the differences in the subjects and to foster their mutual understanding.
cs.AI:This paper describes application of rough set theory, on the analysis of hydrocyclone operation. In this manner, using Self Organizing Map (SOM) as preprocessing step, best crisp granules of data are obtained. Then, using a combining of SOM and rough set theory (RST)-called SORST-, the dominant rules on the information table, obtained from laboratory tests, are extracted. Based on these rules, an approximate estimation on decision attribute is fulfilled. Finally, a brief comparison of this method with the SOM-NFIS system (briefly SONFIS) is highlighted.
cs.AI:We are interested in the problem of multiagent systems development for risk detecting and emergency response in an uncertain and partially perceived environment. The evaluation of the current situation passes by three stages inside the multiagent system. In a first time, the situation is represented in a dynamic way. The second step, consists to characterise the situation and finally, it is compared with other similar known situations. In this paper, we present an information modelling of an observed environment, that we have applied on the RoboCupRescue Simulation System. Information coming from the environment are formatted according to a taxonomy and using semantic features. The latter are defined thanks to a fine ontology of the domain and are managed by factual agents that aim to represent dynamically the current situation.
cs.AI:In this paper, we study the influence of the selective pressure on the performance of cellular genetic algorithms. Cellular genetic algorithms are genetic algorithms where the population is embedded on a toroidal grid. This structure makes the propagation of the best so far individual slow down, and allows to keep in the population potentially good solutions. We present two selective pressure reducing strategies in order to slow down even more the best solution propagation. We experiment these strategies on a hard optimization problem, the quadratic assignment problem, and we show that there is a value for of the control parameter for both which gives the best performance. This optimal value does not find explanation on only the selective pressure, measured either by take over time and diversity evolution. This study makes us conclude that we need other tools than the sole selective pressure measures to explain the performances of cellular genetic algorithms.

cs.AI:In this study, we introduce general frame of MAny Connected Intelligent Particles Systems (MACIPS). Connections and interconnections between particles get a complex behavior of such merely simple system (system in system).Contribution of natural computing, under information granulation theory, are the main topics of this spacious skeleton. Upon this clue, we organize two algorithms involved a few prominent intelligent computing and approximate reasoning methods: self organizing feature map (SOM), Neuro- Fuzzy Inference System and Rough Set Theory (RST). Over this, we show how our algorithms can be taken as a linkage of government-society interaction, where government catches various fashions of behavior: solid (absolute) or flexible. So, transition of such society, by changing of connectivity parameters (noise) from order to disorder is inferred. Add to this, one may find an indirect mapping among financial systems and eventual market fluctuations with MACIPS. Keywords: phase transition, SONFIS, SORST, many connected intelligent particles system, society-government interaction
cs.AI:Affinity propagation clustering (AP) has two limitations: it is hard to know what value of parameter 'preference' can yield an optimal clustering solution, and oscillations cannot be eliminated automatically if occur. The adaptive AP method is proposed to overcome these limitations, including adaptive scanning of preferences to search space of the number of clusters for finding the optimal clustering solution, adaptive adjustment of damping factors to eliminate oscillations, and adaptive escaping from oscillations when the damping adjustment technique fails. Experimental results on simulated and real data sets show that the adaptive AP is effective and can outperform AP in quality of clustering results.
cs.AI:Approximately more than 90% of all coal production in Iranian underground mines is derived directly longwall mining method. Out of seam dilution is one of the essential problems in these mines. Therefore the dilution can impose the additional cost of mining and milling. As a result, recognition of the effective parameters on the dilution has a remarkable role in industry. In this way, this paper has analyzed the influence of 13 parameters (attributed variables) versus the decision attribute (dilution value), so that using two approximate reasoning methods, namely Rough Set Theory (RST) and Self Organizing Neuro- Fuzzy Inference System (SONFIS) the best rules on our collected data sets has been extracted. The other benefit of later methods is to predict new unknown cases. So, the reduced sets (reducts) by RST have been obtained. Therefore the emerged results by utilizing mentioned methods shows that the high sensitive variables are thickness of layer, length of stope, rate of advance, number of miners, type of advancing.
cs.AI:This study, fundamentals of fuzzy block theory, and its application in assessment of stability in underground openings, has surveyed. Using fuzzy topics and inserting them in to key block theory, in two ways, fundamentals of fuzzy block theory has been presented. In indirect combining, by coupling of adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS) and classic block theory, we could extract possible damage parts around a tunnel. In direct solution, some principles of block theory, by means of different fuzzy facets theory, were rewritten.
cs.AI:This paper describes application of information granulation theory, on the analysis of hydrocyclone perforamance. In this manner, using a combining of Self Organizing Map (SOM) and Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS), crisp and fuzzy granules are obtained(briefly called SONFIS). Balancing of crisp granules and sub fuzzy granules, within non fuzzy information (initial granulation), is rendered in an open-close iteration. Using two criteria, "simplicity of rules "and "adaptive threoshold error level", stability of algorithm is guaranteed. Validation of the proposed method, on the data set of the hydrocyclone is rendered.
cs.AI:In everyday life it happens that a person has to reason about what other people think and how they behave, in order to achieve his goals. In other words, an individual may be required to adapt his behaviour by reasoning about the others' mental state. In this paper we focus on a knowledge representation language derived from logic programming which both supports the representation of mental states of individual communities and provides each with the capability of reasoning about others' mental states and acting accordingly. The proposed semantics is shown to be translatable into stable model semantics of logic programs with aggregates.
cs.AI:Many social Web sites allow users to publish content and annotate with descriptive metadata. In addition to flat tags, some social Web sites have recently began to allow users to organize their content and metadata hierarchically. The social photosharing site Flickr, for example, allows users to group related photos in sets, and related sets in collections. The social bookmarking site Del.icio.us similarly lets users group related tags into bundles. Although the sites themselves don't impose any constraints on how these hierarchies are used, individuals generally use them to capture relationships between concepts, most commonly the broader/narrower relations. Collective annotation of content with hierarchical relations may lead to an emergent classification system, called a folksonomy. While some researchers have explored using tags as evidence for learning folksonomies, we believe that hierarchical relations described above offer a high-quality source of evidence for this task.   We propose a simple approach to aggregate shallow hierarchies created by many distinct Flickr users into a common folksonomy. Our approach uses statistics to determine if a particular relation should be retained or discarded. The relations are then woven together into larger hierarchies. Although we have not carried out a detailed quantitative evaluation of the approach, it looks very promising since it generates very reasonable, non-trivial hierarchies.
cs.AI:We analyze the style and structure of story narrative using the case of film scripts. The practical importance of this is noted, especially the need to have support tools for television movie writing. We use the Casablanca film script, and scripts from six episodes of CSI (Crime Scene Investigation). For analysis of style and structure, we quantify various central perspectives discussed in McKee's book, "Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting". Film scripts offer a useful point of departure for exploration of the analysis of more general narratives. Our methodology, using Correspondence Analysis, and hierarchical clustering, is innovative in a range of areas that we discuss. In particular this work is groundbreaking in taking the qualitative analysis of McKee and grounding this analysis in a quantitative and algorithmic framework.
cs.AI:In the last year more than 70,000 people have been brought to the UK hospitals with serious injuries. Each time a clinician has to urgently take a patient through a screening procedure to make a reliable decision on the trauma treatment. Typically, such procedure comprises around 20 tests; however the condition of a trauma patient remains very difficult to be tested properly. What happens if these tests are ambiguously interpreted, and information about the severity of the injury will come misleading? The mistake in a decision can be fatal: using a mild treatment can put a patient at risk of dying from posttraumatic shock, while using an overtreatment can also cause death. How can we reduce the risk of the death caused by unreliable decisions? It has been shown that probabilistic reasoning, based on the Bayesian methodology of averaging over decision models, allows clinicians to evaluate the uncertainty in decision making. Based on this methodology, in this paper we aim at selecting the most important screening tests, keeping a high performance. We assume that the probabilistic reasoning within the Bayesian methodology allows us to discover new relationships between the screening tests and uncertainty in decisions. In practice, selection of the most informative tests can also reduce the cost of a screening procedure in trauma care centers. In our experiments we use the UK Trauma data to compare the efficiency of the proposed technique in terms of the performance. We also compare the uncertainty in decisions in terms of entropy.
cs.AI:We present in this article a new evaluation method for classification and segmentation of textured images in uncertain environments. In uncertain environments, real classes and boundaries are known with only a partial certainty given by the experts. Most of the time, in many presented papers, only classification or only segmentation are considered and evaluated. Here, we propose to take into account both the classification and segmentation results according to the certainty given by the experts. We present the results of this method on a fusion of classifiers of sonar images for a seabed characterization.
cs.AI:The investigation of the terrorist attack is a time-critical task. The investigators have a limited time window to diagnose the organizational background of the terrorists, to run down and arrest the wire-pullers, and to take an action to prevent or eradicate the terrorist attack. The intuitive interface to visualize the intelligence data set stimulates the investigators' experience and knowledge, and aids them in decision-making for an immediately effective action. This paper presents a computational method to analyze the intelligence data set on the collective actions of the perpetrators of the attack, and to visualize it into the form of a social network diagram which predicts the positions where the wire-pullers conceals themselves.
cs.AI:This paper describes application of information granulation theory, on the design of rock engineering flowcharts. Firstly, an overall flowchart, based on information granulation theory has been highlighted. Information granulation theory, in crisp (non-fuzzy) or fuzzy format, can take into account engineering experiences (especially in fuzzy shape-incomplete information or superfluous), or engineering judgments, in each step of designing procedure, while the suitable instruments modeling are employed. In this manner and to extension of soft modeling instruments, using three combinations of Self Organizing Map (SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS), and Rough Set Theory (RST) crisp and fuzzy granules, from monitored data sets are obtained. The main underlined core of our algorithms are balancing of crisp(rough or non-fuzzy) granules and sub fuzzy granules, within non fuzzy information (initial granulation) upon the open-close iterations. Using different criteria on balancing best granules (information pockets), are obtained. Validations of our proposed methods, on the data set of in-situ permeability in rock masses in Shivashan dam, Iran have been highlighted.
cs.AI:Knowledge-based economy forces companies in the nation to group together as a cluster in order to maintain their competitiveness in the world market. The cluster development relies on two key success factors which are knowledge sharing and collaboration between the actors in the cluster. Thus, our study tries to propose knowledge management system to support knowledge management activities within the cluster. To achieve the objectives of this study, ontology takes a very important role in knowledge management process in various ways; such as building reusable and faster knowledge-bases, better way for representing the knowledge explicitly. However, creating and representing ontology create difficulties to organization due to the ambiguity and unstructured of source of knowledge. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to propose the methodology to create and represent ontology for the organization development by using knowledge engineering approach. The handicraft cluster in Thailand is used as a case study to illustrate our proposed methodology.
cs.AI:Crisis response poses many of the most difficult information technology in crisis management. It requires information and communication-intensive efforts, utilized for reducing uncertainty, calculating and comparing costs and benefits, and managing resources in a fashion beyond those regularly available to handle routine problems. In this paper, we explore the benefits of artificial intelligence technologies in crisis response. This paper discusses the role of artificial intelligence technologies; namely, robotics, ontology and semantic web, and multi-agent systems in crisis response.
cs.AI:We present and discuss a mixed conjunctive and disjunctive rule, a generalization of conflict repartition rules, and a combination of these two rules. In the belief functions theory one of the major problem is the conflict repartition enlightened by the famous Zadeh's example. To date, many combination rules have been proposed in order to solve a solution to this problem. Moreover, it can be important to consider the specificity of the responses of the experts. Since few year some unification rules are proposed. We have shown in our previous works the interest of the proportional conflict redistribution rule. We propose here a mixed combination rule following the proportional conflict redistribution rule modified by a discounting procedure. This rule generalizes many combination rules.
cs.AI:In this chapter, we present and discuss a new generalized proportional conflict redistribution rule. The Dezert-Smarandache extension of the Demster-Shafer theory has relaunched the studies on the combination rules especially for the management of the conflict. Many combination rules have been proposed in the last few years. We study here different combination rules and compare them in terms of decision on didactic example and on generated data. Indeed, in real applications, we need a reliable decision and it is the final results that matter. This chapter shows that a fine proportional conflict redistribution rule must be preferred for the combination in the belief function theory.
cs.AI:These last years, there were many studies on the problem of the conflict coming from information combination, especially in evidence theory. We can summarise the solutions for manage the conflict into three different approaches: first, we can try to suppress or reduce the conflict before the combination step, secondly, we can manage the conflict in order to give no influence of the conflict in the combination step, and then take into account the conflict in the decision step, thirdly, we can take into account the conflict in the combination step. The first approach is certainly the better, but not always feasible. It is difficult to say which approach is the best between the second and the third. However, the most important is the produced results in applications. We propose here a new combination rule that distributes the conflict proportionally on the element given this conflict. We compare these different combination rules on real data in Sonar imagery and Radar target classification.
cs.AI:When implementing a propagator for a constraint, one must decide about variants: When implementing min, should one also implement max? Should one implement linear equations both with and without coefficients? Constraint variants are ubiquitous: implementing them requires considerable (if not prohibitive) effort and decreases maintainability, but will deliver better performance.   This paper shows how to use variable views, previously introduced for an implementation architecture, to derive perfect propagator variants. A model for views and derived propagators is introduced. Derived propagators are proved to be indeed perfect in that they inherit essential properties such as correctness and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for systematically deriving propagators such as transformation, generalization, specialization, and channeling are developed for several variable domains. We evaluate the massive impact of derived propagators. Without derived propagators, Gecode would require 140000 rather than 40000 lines of code for propagators.
cs.AI:A serious defect with the Halpern-Pearl (HP) definition of causality is repaired by combining a theory of causality with a theory of defaults. In addition, it is shown that (despite a claim to the contrary) a cause according to the HP condition need not be a single conjunct. A definition of causality motivated by Wright's NESS test is shown to always hold for a single conjunct. Moreover, conditions that hold for all the examples considered by HP are given that guarantee that causality according to (this version) of the NESS test is equivalent to the HP definition.
cs.AI:This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to extremely unscientific errors.
cs.AI:The textured images' classification assumes to consider the images in terms of area with the same texture. In uncertain environment, it could be better to take an imprecise decision or to reject the area corresponding to an unlearning class. Moreover, on the areas that are the classification units, we can have more than one texture. These considerations allows us to develop a belief decision model permitting to reject an area as unlearning and to decide on unions and intersections of learning classes. The proposed approach finds all its justification in an application of seabed characterization from sonar images, which contributes to an illustration.
cs.AI:We study two aspects of information semantics: (i) the collection of all relationships, (ii) tracking and spotting anomaly and change. The first is implemented by endowing all relevant information spaces with a Euclidean metric in a common projected space. The second is modelled by an induced ultrametric. A very general way to achieve a Euclidean embedding of different information spaces based on cross-tabulation counts (and from other input data formats) is provided by Correspondence Analysis. From there, the induced ultrametric that we are particularly interested in takes a sequential - e.g. temporal - ordering of the data into account. We employ such a perspective to look at narrative, "the flow of thought and the flow of language" (Chafe). In application to policy decision making, we show how we can focus analysis in a small number of dimensions.
cs.AI:In this paper we extend Inagaki Weighted Operators fusion rule (WO) in information fusion by doing redistribution of not only the conflicting mass, but also of masses of non-empty intersections, that we call Double Weighted Operators (DWO). Then we propose a new fusion rule Class of Proportional Redistribution of Intersection Masses (CPRIM), which generates many interesting particular fusion rules in information fusion. Both formulas are presented for any number of sources of information. An application and comparison with other fusion rules are given in the last section.
cs.AI:In this chapter, we propose a new practical codification of the elements of the Venn diagram in order to easily manipulate the focal elements. In order to reduce the complexity, the eventual constraints must be integrated in the codification at the beginning. Hence, we only consider a reduced hyper power set $D_r^\Theta$ that can be $2^\Theta$ or $D^\Theta$. We describe all the steps of a general belief function framework. The step of decision is particularly studied, indeed, when we can decide on intersections of the singletons of the discernment space no actual decision functions are easily to use. Hence, two approaches are proposed, an extension of previous one and an approach based on the specificity of the elements on which to decide. The principal goal of this chapter is to provide practical codes of a general belief function framework for the researchers and users needing the belief function theory.
cs.AI:In this paper, we propose in Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) framework, a new probabilistic transformation, called DSmP, in order to build a subjective probability measure from any basic belief assignment defined on any model of the frame of discernment. Several examples are given to show how the DSmP transformation works and we compare it to main existing transformations proposed in the literature so far. We show the advantages of DSmP over classical transformations in term of Probabilistic Information Content (PIC). The direct extension of this transformation for dealing with qualitative belief assignments is also presented.
cs.AI:We discuss metacognitive modelling as an enhancement to cognitive modelling and computing. Metacognitive control mechanisms should enable AI systems to self-reflect, reason about their actions, and to adapt to new situations. In this respect, we propose implementation details of a knowledge taxonomy and an augmented data mining life cycle which supports a live integration of obtained models.
cs.AI:Each cognitive science tries to understand a set of cognitive behaviors. The structuring of knowledge of this nature's aspect is far from what it can be expected about a science. Until now universal standard consistently describing the set of cognitive behaviors has not been found, and there are many questions about the cognitive behaviors for which only there are opinions of members of the scientific community. This article has three proposals. The first proposal is to raise to the scientific community the necessity of unified the cognitive behaviors. The second proposal is claim the application of the Newton's reasoning rules about nature of his book, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, to the cognitive behaviors. The third is to propose a scientific theory, currently developing, that follows the rules established by Newton to make sense of nature, and could be the theory to explain all the cognitive behaviors.
cs.AI:In this article we review standard null-move pruning and introduce our extended version of it, which we call verified null-move pruning. In verified null-move pruning, whenever the shallow null-move search indicates a fail-high, instead of cutting off the search from the current node, the search is continued with reduced depth.   Our experiments with verified null-move pruning show that on average, it constructs a smaller search tree with greater tactical strength in comparison to standard null-move pruning. Moreover, unlike standard null-move pruning, which fails badly in zugzwang positions, verified null-move pruning manages to detect most zugzwangs and in such cases conducts a re-search to obtain the correct result. In addition, verified null-move pruning is very easy to implement, and any standard null-move pruning program can use verified null-move pruning by modifying only a few lines of code.
cs.AI:We extend Knuth's 16 Boolean binary logic operators to fuzzy logic and neutrosophic logic binary operators. Then we generalize them to n-ary fuzzy logic and neutrosophic logic operators using the smarandache codification of the Venn diagram and a defined vector neutrosophic law. In such way, new operators in neutrosophic logic/set/probability are built.
cs.AI:Various local search approaches have recently been applied to machine scheduling problems under multiple objectives. Their foremost consideration is the identification of the set of Pareto optimal alternatives. An important aspect of successfully solving these problems lies in the definition of an appropriate neighbourhood structure. Unclear in this context remains, how interdependencies within the fitness landscape affect the resolution of the problem.   The paper presents a study of neighbourhood search operators for multiple objective flow shop scheduling. Experiments have been carried out with twelve different combinations of criteria. To derive exact conclusions, small problem instances, for which the optimal solutions are known, have been chosen. Statistical tests show that no single neighbourhood operator is able to equally identify all Pareto optimal alternatives. Significant improvements however have been obtained by hybridising the solution algorithm using a randomised variable neighbourhood search technique.
cs.AI:The paper describes the proposition and application of a local search metaheuristic for multi-objective optimization problems. It is based on two main principles of heuristic search, intensification through variable neighborhoods, and diversification through perturbations and successive iterations in favorable regions of the search space. The concept is successfully tested on permutation flow shop scheduling problems under multiple objectives. While the obtained results are encouraging in terms of their quality, another positive attribute of the approach is its' simplicity as it does require the setting of only very few parameters. The implementation of the Pareto Iterated Local Search metaheuristic is based on the MOOPPS computer system of local search heuristics for multi-objective scheduling which has been awarded the European Academic Software Award 2002 in Ronneby, Sweden (http://www.easa-award.net/, http://www.bth.se/llab/easa_2002.nsf)
cs.AI:The article describes an investigation of the effectiveness of genetic algorithms for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) by presenting an application for the vehicle routing problem with soft time windows. The work is motivated by the question, if and how the problem structure influences the effectiveness of different configurations of the genetic algorithm. Computational results are presented for different classes of vehicle routing problems, varying in their coverage with time windows, time window size, distribution and number of customers. The results are compared with a simple, but effective local search approach for multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems.
cs.AI:The talk describes a general approach of a genetic algorithm for multiple objective optimization problems. A particular dominance relation between the individuals of the population is used to define a fitness operator, enabling the genetic algorithm to adress even problems with efficient, but convex-dominated alternatives. The algorithm is implemented in a multilingual computer program, solving vehicle routing problems with time windows under multiple objectives. The graphical user interface of the program shows the progress of the genetic algorithm and the main parameters of the approach can be easily modified. In addition to that, the program provides powerful decision support to the decision maker. The software has proved it's excellence at the finals of the European Academic Software Award EASA, held at the Keble college/ University of Oxford/ Great Britain.
cs.AI:The article presents a framework for the resolution of rich vehicle routing problems which are difficult to address with standard optimization techniques. We use local search on the basis on variable neighborhood search for the construction of the solutions, but embed the techniques in a flexible framework that allows the consideration of complex side constraints of the problem such as time windows, multiple depots, heterogeneous fleets, and, in particular, multiple optimization criteria. In order to identify a compromise alternative that meets the requirements of the decision maker, an interactive procedure is integrated in the resolution of the problem, allowing the modification of the preference information articulated by the decision maker. The framework is prototypically implemented in a computer system. First results of test runs on multiple depot vehicle routing problems with time windows are reported.
cs.AI:The integration of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic into scheduling is a rather new aspect with growing importance for manufacturing applications, resulting in various unsolved aspects. In the current paper, we investigate an improved local search technique for fuzzy scheduling problems with fitness plateaus, using a multi criteria formulation of the problem. We especially address the problem of changing job priorities over time as studied at the Sherwood Press Ltd, a Nottingham based printing company, who is a collaborator on the project.
cs.AI:The article proposes a heuristic approximation approach to the bin packing problem under multiple objectives. In addition to the traditional objective of minimizing the number of bins, the heterogeneousness of the elements in each bin is minimized, leading to a biobjective formulation of the problem with a tradeoff between the number of bins and their heterogeneousness. An extension of the Best-Fit approximation algorithm is presented to solve the problem. Experimental investigations have been carried out on benchmark instances of different size, ranging from 100 to 1000 items. Encouraging results have been obtained, showing the applicability of the heuristic approach to the described problem.
cs.AI:The article presents a local search approach for the solution of timetabling problems in general, with a particular implementation for competition track 3 of the International Timetabling Competition 2007 (ITC 2007). The heuristic search procedure is based on Threshold Accepting to overcome local optima. A stochastic neighborhood is proposed and implemented, randomly removing and reassigning events from the current solution.   The overall concept has been incrementally obtained from a series of experiments, which we describe in each (sub)section of the paper. In result, we successfully derived a potential candidate solution approach for the finals of track 3 of the ITC 2007.
cs.AI:The paper presents a study of local search heuristics in general and variable neighborhood search in particular for the resolution of an assignment problem studied in the practical work of universities. Here, students have to be assigned to scientific topics which are proposed and supported by members of staff. The problem involves the optimization under given preferences of students which may be expressed when applying for certain topics.   It is possible to observe that variable neighborhood search leads to superior results for the tested problem instances. One instance is taken from an actual case, while others have been generated based on the real world data to support the analysis with a deeper analysis.   An extension of the problem has been formulated by integrating a second objective function that simultaneously balances the workload of the members of staff while maximizing utility of the students. The algorithmic approach has been prototypically implemented in a computer system. One important aspect in this context is the application of the research work to problems of other scientific institutions, and therefore the provision of decision support functionalities.
cs.AI:We introduce an extended tableau calculus for answer set programming (ASP). The proof system is based on the ASP tableaux defined in [Gebser&Schaub, ICLP 2006], with an added extension rule. We investigate the power of Extended ASP Tableaux both theoretically and empirically. We study the relationship of Extended ASP Tableaux with the Extended Resolution proof system defined by Tseitin for sets of clauses, and separate Extended ASP Tableaux from ASP Tableaux by giving a polynomial-length proof for a family of normal logic programs P_n for which ASP Tableaux has exponential-length minimal proofs with respect to n. Additionally, Extended ASP Tableaux imply interesting insight into the effect of program simplification on the lengths of proofs in ASP. Closely related to Extended ASP Tableaux, we empirically investigate the effect of redundant rules on the efficiency of ASP solving.   To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
cs.AI:In this paper, a Gaifman-Shapiro-style module architecture is tailored to the case of Smodels programs under the stable model semantics. The composition of Smodels program modules is suitably limited by module conditions which ensure the compatibility of the module system with stable models. Hence the semantics of an entire Smodels program depends directly on stable models assigned to its modules. This result is formalized as a module theorem which truly strengthens Lifschitz and Turner's splitting-set theorem for the class of Smodels programs. To streamline generalizations in the future, the module theorem is first proved for normal programs and then extended to cover Smodels programs using a translation from the latter class of programs to the former class. Moreover, the respective notion of module-level equivalence, namely modular equivalence, is shown to be a proper congruence relation: it is preserved under substitutions of modules that are modularly equivalent. Principles for program decomposition are also addressed. The strongly connected components of the respective dependency graph can be exploited in order to extract a module structure when there is no explicit a priori knowledge about the modules of a program. The paper includes a practical demonstration of tools that have been developed for automated (de)composition of Smodels programs.   To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming.
cs.AI:Most research related to unithood were conducted as part of a larger effort for the determination of termhood. Consequently, novelties are rare in this small sub-field of term extraction. In addition, existing work were mostly empirically motivated and derived. We propose a new probabilistically-derived measure, independent of any influences of termhood, that provides dedicated measures to gather linguistic evidence from parsed text and statistical evidence from Google search engine for the measurement of unithood. Our comparative study using 1,825 test cases against an existing empirically-derived function revealed an improvement in terms of precision, recall and accuracy.
cs.AI:Most works related to unithood were conducted as part of a larger effort for the determination of termhood. Consequently, the number of independent research that study the notion of unithood and produce dedicated techniques for measuring unithood is extremely small. We propose a new approach, independent of any influences of termhood, that provides dedicated measures to gather linguistic evidence from parsed text and statistical evidence from Google search engine for the measurement of unithood. Our evaluations revealed a precision and recall of 98.68% and 91.82% respectively with an accuracy at 95.42% in measuring the unithood of 1005 test cases.
cs.AI:An increasing number of approaches for ontology engineering from text are gearing towards the use of online sources such as company intranet and the World Wide Web. Despite such rise, not much work can be found in aspects of preprocessing and cleaning dirty texts from online sources. This paper presents an enhancement of an Integrated Scoring for Spelling error correction, Abbreviation expansion and Case restoration (ISSAC). ISSAC is implemented as part of a text preprocessing phase in an ontology engineering system. New evaluations performed on the enhanced ISSAC using 700 chat records reveal an improved accuracy of 98% as compared to 96.5% and 71% based on the use of only basic ISSAC and of Aspell, respectively.
cs.AI:We present a domain-independent algorithm that computes macros in a novel way. Our algorithm computes macros "on-the-fly" for a given set of states and does not require previously learned or inferred information, nor prior domain knowledge. The algorithm is used to define new domain-independent tractable classes of classical planning that are proved to include \emph{Blocksworld-arm} and \emph{Towers of Hanoi}.
cs.AI:In this study, we reproduce two new hybrid intelligent systems, involve three prominent intelligent computing and approximate reasoning methods: Self Organizing feature Map (SOM), Neruo-Fuzzy Inference System and Rough Set Theory (RST),called SONFIS and SORST. We show how our algorithms can be construed as a linkage of government-society interactions, where government catches various states of behaviors: solid (absolute) or flexible. So, transition of society, by changing of connectivity parameters (noise) from order to disorder is inferred.
cs.AI:The paper presents the investigation and implementation of the relationship between diversity and the performance of multiple classifiers on classification accuracy. The study is critical as to build classifiers that are strong and can generalize better. The parameters of the neural network within the committee were varied to induce diversity; hence structural diversity is the focus for this study. The hidden nodes and the activation function are the parameters that were varied. The diversity measures that were adopted from ecology such as Shannon and Simpson were used to quantify diversity. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal ensemble by using the accuracy as the cost function. The results observed shows that there is a relationship between structural diversity and accuracy. It is observed that the classification accuracy of an ensemble increases as the diversity increases. There was an increase of 3%-6% in the classification accuracy.
cs.AI:The paper presents an exponential pheromone deposition rule to modify the basic ant system algorithm which employs constant deposition rule. A stability analysis using differential equation is carried out to find out the values of parameters that make the ant system dynamics stable for both kinds of deposition rule. A roadmap of connected cities is chosen as the problem environment where the shortest route between two given cities is required to be discovered. Simulations performed with both forms of deposition approach using Elitist Ant System model reveal that the exponential deposition approach outperforms the classical one by a large extent. Exhaustive experiments are also carried out to find out the optimum setting of different controlling parameters for exponential deposition approach and an empirical relationship between the major controlling parameters of the algorithm and some features of problem environment.
cs.AI:This article presents a unique design for a parser using the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. The paper implements the intuitive thought process of human mind through the activities of artificial ants. The scheme presented here uses a bottom-up approach and the parsing program can directly use ambiguous or redundant grammars. We allocate a node corresponding to each production rule present in the given grammar. Each node is connected to all other nodes (representing other production rules), thereby establishing a completely connected graph susceptible to the movement of artificial ants. Each ant tries to modify this sentential form by the production rule present in the node and upgrades its position until the sentential form reduces to the start symbol S. Successful ants deposit pheromone on the links that they have traversed through. Eventually, the optimum path is discovered by the links carrying maximum amount of pheromone concentration. The design is simple, versatile, robust and effective and obviates the calculation of the above mentioned sets and precedence relation tables. Further advantages of our scheme lie in i) ascertaining whether a given string belongs to the language represented by the grammar, and ii) finding out the shortest possible path from the given string to the start symbol S in case multiple routes exist.
cs.AI:The paper presents an exponential pheromone deposition approach to improve the performance of classical Ant System algorithm which employs uniform deposition rule. A simplified analysis using differential equations is carried out to study the stability of basic ant system dynamics with both exponential and constant deposition rules. A roadmap of connected cities, where the shortest path between two specified cities are to be found out, is taken as a platform to compare Max-Min Ant System model (an improved and popular model of Ant System algorithm) with exponential and constant deposition rules. Extensive simulations are performed to find the best parameter settings for non-uniform deposition approach and experiments with these parameter settings revealed that the above approach outstripped the traditional one by a large extent in terms of both solution quality and convergence time.
cs.AI:We address here two major challenges presented by dynamic data mining: 1) the stability challenge: we have implemented a rigorous incremental density-based clustering algorithm, independent from any initial conditions and ordering of the data-vectors stream, 2) the cognitive challenge: we have implemented a stringent selection process of association rules between clusters at time t-1 and time t for directly generating the main conclusions about the dynamics of a data-stream. We illustrate these points with an application to a two years and 2600 documents scientific information database.
cs.AI:Data-stream clustering is an ever-expanding subdomain of knowledge extraction. Most of the past and present research effort aims at efficient scaling up for the huge data repositories. Our approach focuses on qualitative improvement, mainly for "weak signals" detection and precise tracking of topical evolutions in the framework of information watch - though scalability is intrinsically guaranteed in a possibly distributed implementation. Our GERMEN algorithm exhaustively picks up the whole set of density peaks of the data at time t, by identifying the local perturbations induced by the current document vector, such as changing cluster borders, or new/vanishing clusters. Optimality yields from the uniqueness 1) of the density landscape for any value of our zoom parameter, 2) of the cluster allocation operated by our border propagation rule. This results in a rigorous independence from the data presentation ranking or any initialization parameter. We present here as a first step the only assessment of a static view resulting from one year of the CNRS/INIST Pascal database in the field of geotechnics.
cs.AI:This paper gives an introduction to this issue, and presents the framework and the main steps of the Rosa project. Four teams of researchers, agronomists, computer scientists, psychologists and linguists were involved during five years within this project that aimed at the development of a knowledge based system. The purpose of the Rosa system is the modelling and the comparison of farm spatial organizations. It relies on a formalization of agronomical knowledge and thus induces a joint knowledge building process involving both the agronomists and the computer scientists. The paper describes the steps of the modelling process as well as the filming procedures set up by the psychologists and linguists in order to make explicit and to analyze the underlying knowledge building process.
cs.AI:Collaborative tagging systems, such as Delicious, CiteULike, and others, allow users to annotate resources, e.g., Web pages or scientific papers, with descriptive labels called tags. The social annotations contributed by thousands of users, can potentially be used to infer categorical knowledge, classify documents or recommend new relevant information. Traditional text inference methods do not make best use of social annotation, since they do not take into account variations in individual users' perspectives and vocabulary. In a previous work, we introduced a simple probabilistic model that takes interests of individual annotators into account in order to find hidden topics of annotated resources. Unfortunately, that approach had one major shortcoming: the number of topics and interests must be specified a priori. To address this drawback, we extend the model to a fully Bayesian framework, which offers a way to automatically estimate these numbers. In particular, the model allows the number of interests and topics to change as suggested by the structure of the data. We evaluate the proposed model in detail on the synthetic and real-world data by comparing its performance to Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the topic extraction task. For the latter evaluation, we apply the model to infer topics of Web resources from social annotations obtained from Delicious in order to discover new resources similar to a specified one. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model is a promising method for exploiting social knowledge contained in user-generated annotations.
cs.AI:Airport gate assignment is of great importance in airport operations. In this paper, we study the Airport Gate Assignment Problem (AGAP), propose a new model and implement the model with Optimization Programming language (OPL). With the objective to minimize the number of conflicts of any two adjacent aircrafts assigned to the same gate, we build a mathematical model with logical constraints and the binary constraints, which can provide an efficient evaluation criterion for the Airlines to estimate the current gate assignment. To illustrate the feasibility of the model we construct experiments with the data obtained from Continental Airlines, Houston Gorge Bush Intercontinental Airport IAH, which indicate that our model is both energetic and effective. Moreover, we interpret experimental results, which further demonstrate that our proposed model can provide a powerful tool for airline companies to estimate the efficiency of their current work of gate assignment.
cs.AI:This paper investigates the use of different Artificial Intelligence methods to predict the values of several continuous variables from a Steam Generator. The objective was to determine how the different artificial intelligence methods performed in making predictions on the given dataset. The artificial intelligence methods evaluated were Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems. The types of neural networks investigated were Multi-Layer Perceptions, and Radial Basis Function. Bayesian and committee techniques were applied to these neural networks. Each of the AI methods considered was simulated in Matlab. The results of the simulations showed that all the AI methods were capable of predicting the Steam Generator data reasonably accurately. However, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system out performed the other methods in terms of accuracy and ease of implementation, while still achieving a fast execution time as well as a reasonable training time.
cs.AI:Theoretical analysis of machine intelligence (MI) is useful for defining a common platform in both theoretical and applied artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of this paper is to set canonical definitions that can assist pragmatic research in both strong and weak AI. Described epistemological features of machine intelligence include relationship between intelligent behavior, intelligent and unintelligent machine characteristics, observable and unobservable entities and classification of intelligence. The paper also establishes algebraic definitions of efficiency and accuracy of MI tests as their quality measure. The last part of the paper addresses the learning process with respect to the traditional epistemology and the epistemology of MI described here. The proposed views on MI positively correlate to the Hegelian monistic epistemology and contribute towards amalgamating idealistic deliberations with the AI theory, particularly in a local frame of reference.
cs.AI:Answer set programming (ASP) is a logic programming paradigm that can be used to solve complex combinatorial search problems. Aggregates are an ASP construct that plays an important role in many applications. Defining a satisfactory semantics of aggregates turned out to be a difficult problem, and in this paper we propose a new approach, based on an analogy between aggregates and propositional connectives. First, we extend the definition of an answer set/stable model to cover arbitrary propositional theories; then we define aggregates on top of them both as primitive constructs and as abbreviations for formulas. Our definition of an aggregate combines expressiveness and simplicity, and it inherits many theorems about programs with nested expressions, such as theorems about strong equivalence and splitting.
cs.AI:The standard classification of emotions involves categorizing the expression of emotions. In this paper, parameters underlying some emotions are identified and a new classification based on these parameters is suggested.
cs.AI:Neural networks are powerful tools for classification and regression in static environments. This paper describes a technique for creating an ensemble of neural networks that adapts dynamically to changing conditions. The model separates the input space into four regions and each network is given a weight in each region based on its performance on samples from that region. The ensemble adapts dynamically by constantly adjusting these weights based on the current performance of the networks. The data set used is a collection of financial indicators with the goal of predicting the future platinum price. An ensemble with no weightings does not improve on the naive estimate of no weekly change; our weighting algorithm gives an average percentage error of 63% for twenty weeks of prediction.
cs.AI:Health Practice Guideliens are supposed to unify practices and propose recommendations to physicians. This paper describes GemFrame, a system capable of semi-automatically filling an XML template from free texts in the clinical domain. The XML template includes semantic information not explicitly encoded in the text (pairs of conditions and ac-tions/recommendations). Therefore, there is a need to compute the exact scope of condi-tions over text sequences expressing the re-quired actions. We present a system developped for this task. We show that it yields good performance when applied to the analysis of French practice guidelines. We conclude with a precise evaluation of the tool.
cs.AI:The need for domain ontologies in mission critical applications such as risk management and hazard identification is becoming more and more pressing. Most research on ontology learning conducted in the academia remains unrealistic for real-world applications. One of the main problems is the dependence on non-incremental, rare knowledge and textual resources, and manually-crafted patterns and rules. This paper reports work in progress aiming to address such undesirable dependencies during ontology construction. Initial experiments using a working prototype of the system revealed promising potentials in automatically constructing high-quality domain ontologies using real-world texts.
cs.AI:We introduce novel results for approximate inference on planar graphical models using the loop calculus framework. The loop calculus (Chertkov and Chernyak, 2006) allows to express the exact partition function of a graphical model as a finite sum of terms that can be evaluated once the belief propagation (BP) solution is known. In general, full summation over all correction terms is intractable. We develop an algorithm for the approach presented in (Certkov et al., 2008) which represents an efficient truncation scheme on planar graphs and a new representation of the series in terms of Pfaffians of matrices. We analyze the performance of the algorithm for the partition function approximation for models with binary variables and pairwise interactions on grids and other planar graphs. We study in detail both the loop series and the equivalent Pfaffian series and show that the first term of the Pfaffian series for the general, intractable planar model, can provide very accurate approximations. The algorithm outperforms previous truncation schemes of the loop series and is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods for approximate inference.
cs.AI:In this paper we present the N-norms/N-conorms in neutrosophic logic and set as extensions of T-norms/T-conorms in fuzzy logic and set. Also, as an extension of the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Topology we present the Neutrosophic Topologies.
cs.AI:When a considerable number of mutations have no effects on fitness values, the fitness landscape is said neutral. In order to study the interplay between neutrality, which exists in many real-world applications, and performances of metaheuristics, it is useful to design landscapes which make it possible to tune precisely neutral degree distribution. Even though many neutral landscape models have already been designed, none of them are general enough to create landscapes with specific neutral degree distributions. We propose three steps to design such landscapes: first using an algorithm we construct a landscape whose distribution roughly fits the target one, then we use a simulated annealing heuristic to bring closer the two distributions and finally we affect fitness values to each neutral network. Then using this new family of fitness landscapes we are able to highlight the interplay between deceptiveness and neutrality.
cs.AI:The pharmacovigilance databases consist of several case reports involving drugs and adverse events (AEs). Some methods are applied consistently to highlight all signals, i.e. all statistically significant associations between a drug and an AE. These methods are appropriate for verification of more complex relationships involving one or several drug(s) and AE(s) (e.g; syndromes or interactions) but do not address the identification of them. We propose a method for the extraction of these relationships based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) associated with disproportionality measures. This method identifies all sets of drugs and AEs which are potential signals, syndromes or interactions. Compared to a previous experience of disproportionality analysis without FCA, the addition of FCA was more efficient for identifying false positives related to concomitant drugs.
cs.AI:Domain experts should provide relevant domain knowledge to an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) so that it can guide a learner during problemsolving learning activities. However, for many ill-defined domains, the domain knowledge is hard to define explicitly. In previous works, we showed how sequential pattern mining can be used to extract a partial problem space from logged user interactions, and how it can support tutoring services during problem-solving exercises. This article describes an extension of this approach to extract a problem space that is richer and more adapted for supporting tutoring services. We combined sequential pattern mining with (1) dimensional pattern mining (2) time intervals, (3) the automatic clustering of valued actions and (4) closed sequences mining. Some tutoring services have been implemented and an experiment has been conducted in a tutoring system.
cs.AI:In this paper we propose the CTS (Concious Tutoring System) technology, a biologically plausible cognitive agent based on human brain functions.This agent is capable of learning and remembering events and any related information such as corresponding procedures, stimuli and their emotional valences. Our proposed episodic memory and episodic learning mechanism are closer to the current multiple-trace theory in neuroscience, because they are inspired by it [5] contrary to other mechanisms that are incorporated in cognitive agents. This is because in our model emotions play a role in the encoding and remembering of events. This allows the agent to improve its behavior by remembering previously selected behaviors which are influenced by its emotional mechanism. Moreover, the architecture incorporates a realistic memory consolidation process based on a data mining algorithm.
cs.AI:Consumers of mass media must have a comprehensive, balanced and plural selection of news to get an unbiased perspective; but achieving this goal can be very challenging, laborious and time consuming. News stories development over time, its (in)consistency, and different level of coverage across the media outlets are challenges that a conscientious reader has to overcome in order to alleviate bias.   In this paper we present an intelligent agent framework currently facilitating analysis of the main sources of on-line news in El Salvador. We show how prior tools of text analysis and Web 2.0 technologies can be combined with minimal manual intervention to help individuals on their rational decision process, while holding media outlets accountable for their work.
cs.AI:We study the logic of comparative concept similarity $\CSL$ introduced by Sheremet, Tishkovsky, Wolter and Zakharyaschev to capture a form of qualitative similarity comparison. In this logic we can formulate assertions of the form " objects A are more similar to B than to C". The semantics of this logic is defined by structures equipped by distance functions evaluating the similarity degree of objects. We consider here the particular case of the semantics induced by \emph{minspaces}, the latter being distance spaces where the minimum of a set of distances always exists. It turns out that the semantics over arbitrary minspaces can be equivalently specified in terms of preferential structures, typical of conditional logics. We first give a direct axiomatisation of this logic over Minspaces. We next define a decision procedure in the form of a tableaux calculus. Both the calculus and the axiomatisation take advantage of the reformulation of the semantics in terms of preferential structures.
cs.AI:Data mining algorithms are now able to efficiently deal with huge amount of data. Various kinds of patterns may be discovered and may have some great impact on the general development of knowledge. In many domains, end users may want to have their data mined by data mining tools in order to extract patterns that could impact their business. Nevertheless, those users are often overwhelmed by the large quantity of patterns extracted in such a situation. Moreover, some privacy issues, or some commercial one may lead the users not to be able to mine the data by themselves. Thus, the users may not have the possibility to perform many experiments integrating various constraints in order to focus on specific patterns they would like to extract. Post processing of patterns may be an answer to that drawback. Thus, in this paper we present a framework that could allow end users to manage collections of patterns. We propose to use an efficient data structure on which some algebraic operators may be used in order to retrieve or access patterns in pattern bases.
cs.AI:Empirical evidence suggests that hashing is an effective strategy for dimensionality reduction and practical nonparametric estimation. In this paper we provide exponential tail bounds for feature hashing and show that the interaction between random subspaces is negligible with high probability. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with experimental results for a new use case -- multitask learning with hundreds of thousands of tasks.
cs.AI:We propose a new extended format to represent constraint networks using XML. This format allows us to represent constraints defined either in extension or in intension. It also allows us to reference global constraints. Any instance of the problems CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem), QCSP (Quantified CSP) and WCSP (Weighted CSP) can be represented using this format.
cs.AI:The present work consisted in developing a plateau game. There are the traditional ones (monopoly, cluedo, ect.) but those which interest us leave less place at the chance (luck) than to the strategy such that the chess game. Kallah is an old African game, its rules are simple but the strategies to be used are very complex to implement. Of course, they are based on a strongly mathematical basis as in the film "Rain-Man" where one can see that gambling can be payed with strategies based on mathematical theories. The Artificial Intelligence gives the possibility "of thinking" to a machine and, therefore, allows it to make decisions. In our work, we use it to give the means to the computer choosing its best movement.
cs.AI:1-Nearest Neighbor with the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is one of the most effective classifiers on time series domain. Since the global constraint has been introduced in speech community, many global constraint models have been proposed including Sakoe-Chiba (S-C) band, Itakura Parallelogram, and Ratanamahatana-Keogh (R-K) band. The R-K band is a general global constraint model that can represent any global constraints with arbitrary shape and size effectively. However, we need a good learning algorithm to discover the most suitable set of R-K bands, and the current R-K band learning algorithm still suffers from an 'overfitting' phenomenon. In this paper, we propose two new learning algorithms, i.e., band boundary extraction algorithm and iterative learning algorithm. The band boundary extraction is calculated from the bound of all possible warping paths in each class, and the iterative learning is adjusted from the original R-K band learning. We also use a Silhouette index, a well-known clustering validation technique, as a heuristic function, and the lower bound function, LB_Keogh, to enhance the prediction speed. Twenty datasets, from the Workshop and Challenge on Time Series Classification, held in conjunction of the SIGKDD 2007, are used to evaluate our approach.
cs.AI:We propose Range and Roots which are two common patterns useful for specifying a wide range of counting and occurrence constraints. We design specialised propagation algorithms for these two patterns. Counting and occurrence constraints specified using these patterns thus directly inherit a propagation algorithm. To illustrate the capabilities of the Range and Roots constraints, we specify a number of global constraints taken from the literature. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that propagating counting and occurrence constraints using these two patterns leads to a small loss in performance when compared to specialised global constraints and is competitive with alternative decompositions using elementary constraints.
cs.AI:The management and combination of uncertain, imprecise, fuzzy and even paradoxical or high conflicting sources of information has always been, and still remains today, of primal importance for the development of reliable modern information systems involving artificial reasoning. In this introduction, we present a survey of our recent theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning, known as Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT), developed for dealing with imprecise, uncertain and conflicting sources of information. We focus our presentation on the foundations of DSmT and on its most important rules of combination, rather than on browsing specific applications of DSmT available in literature. Several simple examples are given throughout this presentation to show the efficiency and the generality of this new approach.
cs.AI:When mathematicians present proofs they usually adapt their explanations to their didactic goals and to the (assumed) knowledge of their addressees. Modern automated theorem provers, in contrast, present proofs usually at a fixed level of detail (also called granularity). Often these presentations are neither intended nor suitable for human use. A challenge therefore is to develop user- and goal-adaptive proof presentation techniques that obey common mathematical practice. We present a flexible and adaptive approach to proof presentation that exploits machine learning techniques to extract a model of the specific granularity of proof examples and employs this model for the automated generation of further proofs at an adapted level of granularity.
cs.AI:Symmetry is an important factor in solving many constraint satisfaction problems. One common type of symmetry is when we have symmetric values. In a recent series of papers, we have studied methods to break value symmetries. Our results identify computational limits on eliminating value symmetry. For instance, we prove that pruning all symmetric values is NP-hard in general. Nevertheless, experiments show that much value symmetry can be broken in practice. These results may be useful to researchers in planning, scheduling and other areas as value symmetry occurs in many different domains.
cs.AI:An attractive mechanism to specify global constraints in rostering and other domains is via formal languages. For instance, the Regular and Grammar constraints specify constraints in terms of the languages accepted by an automaton and a context-free grammar respectively. Taking advantage of the fixed length of the constraint, we give an algorithm to transform a context-free grammar into an automaton. We then study the use of minimization techniques to reduce the size of such automata and speed up propagation. We show that minimizing such automata after they have been unfolded and domains initially reduced can give automata that are more compact than minimizing before unfolding and reducing. Experimental results show that such transformations can improve the size of rostering problems that we can 'model and run'.
cs.AI:We propose a new family of constraints which combine together lexicographical ordering constraints for symmetry breaking with other common global constraints. We give a general purpose propagator for this family of constraints, and show how to improve its complexity by exploiting properties of the included global constraints.
cs.AI:We present an online method for estimating the cost of solving SAT problems. Modern SAT solvers present several challenges to estimate search cost including non-chronological backtracking, learning and restarts. Our method uses a linear model trained on data gathered at the start of search. We show the effectiveness of this method using random and structured problems. We demonstrate that predictions made in early restarts can be used to improve later predictions. We also show that we can use such cost estimations to select a solver from a portfolio.
cs.AI:In this work, we deal with the question of modeling programming exercises for novices pointing to an e-learning scenario. Our purpose is to identify basic requirements, raise some key questions and propose potential answers from a conceptual perspective. Presented as a general picture, we hypothetically situate our work in a general context where e-learning instructional material needs to be adapted to form part of an introductory Computer Science (CS) e-learning course at the CS1-level. Meant is a potential course which aims at improving novices skills and knowledge on the essentials of programming by using e-learning based approaches in connection (at least conceptually) with a general host framework like Activemath (www.activemath.org). Our elaboration covers contextual and, particularly, cognitive elements preparing the terrain for eventual research stages in a derived project, as indicated. We concentrate our main efforts on reasoning mechanisms about exercise complexity that can eventually offer tool support for the task of exercise authoring. We base our requirements analysis on our own perception of the exercise subsystem provided by Activemath especially within the domain reasoner area. We enrich the analysis by bringing to the discussion several relevant contextual elements from the CS1 courses, its definition and implementation. Concerning cognitive models and exercises, we build upon the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy as a relatively standardized basis and use them as a framework for study and analysis of complexity in basic programming exercises. Our analysis includes requirements for the domain reasoner which are necessary for the exercise analysis. We propose for such a purpose a three-layered conceptual model considering exercise evaluation, programming and metaprogramming.
cs.AI:Successful management of emotional stimuli is a pivotal issue concerning Affective Computing (AC) and the related research. As a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, AC is concerned not only with the design of computer systems and the accompanying hardware that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions, but also with the development of systems that can trigger human emotional response in an ordered and controlled manner. This requires the maximum attainable precision and efficiency in the extraction of data from emotionally annotated databases While these databases do use keywords or tags for description of the semantic content, they do not provide either the necessary flexibility or leverage needed to efficiently extract the pertinent emotional content. Therefore, to this extent we propose an introduction of ontologies as a new paradigm for description of emotionally annotated data. The ability to select and sequence data based on their semantic attributes is vital for any study involving metadata, semantics and ontological sorting like the Semantic Web or the Social Semantic Desktop, and the approach described in the paper facilitates reuse in these areas as well.
cs.AI:To model combinatorial decision problems involving uncertainty and probability, we introduce scenario based stochastic constraint programming. Stochastic constraint programs contain both decision variables, which we can set, and stochastic variables, which follow a discrete probability distribution. We provide a semantics for stochastic constraint programs based on scenario trees. Using this semantics, we can compile stochastic constraint programs down into conventional (non-stochastic) constraint programs. This allows us to exploit the full power of existing constraint solvers. We have implemented this framework for decision making under uncertainty in stochastic OPL, a language which is based on the OPL constraint modelling language [Hentenryck et al., 1999]. To illustrate the potential of this framework, we model a wide range of problems in areas as diverse as portfolio diversification, agricultural planning and production/inventory management.
cs.AI:To model combinatorial decision problems involving uncertainty and probability, we introduce stochastic constraint programming. Stochastic constraint programs contain both decision variables (which we can set) and stochastic variables (which follow a probability distribution). They combine together the best features of traditional constraint satisfaction, stochastic integer programming, and stochastic satisfiability. We give a semantics for stochastic constraint programs, and propose a number of complete algorithms and approximation procedures. Finally, we discuss a number of extensions of stochastic constraint programming to relax various assumptions like the independence between stochastic variables, and compare with other approaches for decision making under uncertainty.
cs.AI:Often user interfaces of theorem proving systems focus on assisting particularly trained and skilled users, i.e., proof experts. As a result, the systems are difficult to use for non-expert users. This paper describes a paper and pencil HCI experiment, in which (non-expert) students were asked to make suggestions for a GUI for an interactive system for mathematical proofs. They had to explain the usage of the GUI by applying it to construct a proof sketch for a given theorem. The evaluation of the experiment provides insights for the interaction design for non-expert users and the needs and wants of this user group.
cs.AI:The Ouroboros Model is a new conceptual proposal for an algorithmic structure for efficient data processing in living beings as well as for artificial agents. Its central feature is a general repetitive loop where one iteration cycle sets the stage for the next. Sensory input activates data structures (schemata) with similar constituents encountered before, thus expectations are kindled. This corresponds to the highlighting of empty slots in the selected schema, and these expectations are compared with the actually encountered input. Depending on the outcome of this consumption analysis different next steps like search for further data or a reset, i.e. a new attempt employing another schema, are triggered. Monitoring of the whole process, and in particular of the flow of activation directed by the consumption analysis, yields valuable feedback for the optimum allocation of attention and resources including the selective establishment of useful new memory entries.
cs.AI:In a certain number of situations, human cognitive functioning is difficult to represent with classical artificial intelligence structures. Such a difficulty arises in the polyneuropathy diagnosis which is based on the spatial distribution, along the nerve fibres, of lesions, together with the synthesis of several partial diagnoses. Faced with this problem while building up an expert system (NEUROP), we developed a heterogeneous knowledge representation associating a finite automaton with first order logic. A number of knowledge representation problems raised by the electromyography test features are examined in this study and the expert system architecture allowing such a knowledge modeling are laid out.
cs.AI:In this paper a new dynamic subsumption technique for Boolean CNF formulae is proposed. It exploits simple and sufficient conditions to detect during conflict analysis, clauses from the original formula that can be reduced by subsumption. During the learnt clause derivation, and at each step of the resolution process, we simply check for backward subsumption between the current resolvent and clauses from the original formula and encoded in the implication graph. Our approach give rise to a strong and dynamic simplification technique that exploits learning to eliminate literals from the original clauses. Experimental results show that the integration of our dynamic subsumption approach within the state-of-the-art SAT solvers Minisat and Rsat achieves interesting improvements particularly on crafted instances.
cs.AI:Today, science have a powerful tool for the description of reality - the numbers. However, the concept of number was not immediately, lets try to trace the evolution of the concept. The numbers emerged as the need for accurate estimates of the amount in order to permit a comparison of some objects. So if you see to it how many times a day a person uses the numbers and compare, it becomes evident that the comparison is used much more frequently. However, the comparison is not possible without two opposite basic standards. Thus, to introduce the concept of comparison, must have two opposing standards, in turn, the operation of comparison is necessary to introduce the concept of number. Arguably, the scientific description of reality is impossible without the concept of opposites.   In this paper analyzes the concept of opposites, as the basis for the introduction of the principle of development.
cs.AI:Social Network Analysis (SNA) tries to understand and exploit the key features of social networks in order to manage their life cycle and predict their evolution. Increasingly popular web 2.0 sites are forming huge social network. Classical methods from social network analysis (SNA) have been applied to such online networks. In this paper, we propose leveraging semantic web technologies to merge and exploit the best features of each domain. We present how to facilitate and enhance the analysis of online social networks, exploiting the power of semantic social network analysis.
cs.AI:We describe a variant of resolution rule of proof and show that it is complete for stable semantics of logic programs. We show applications of this result.
cs.AI:A fuzzy mnesor space is a semimodule over the positive real numbers. It can be used as theoretical framework for fuzzy sets. Hence we can prove a great number of properties for fuzzy sets without refering to the membership functions.
cs.AI:We apply proof-theoretic techniques in answer Set Programming. The main results include: 1. A characterization of continuity properties of Gelfond-Lifschitz operator for logic program. 2. A propositional characterization of stable models of logic programs (without referring to loop formulas.
cs.AI:We show that some common and important global constraints like ALL-DIFFERENT and GCC can be decomposed into simple arithmetic constraints on which we achieve bound or range consistency, and in some cases even greater pruning. These decompositions can be easily added to new solvers. They also provide other constraints with access to the state of the propagator by sharing of variables. Such sharing can be used to improve propagation between constraints. We report experiments with our decomposition in a pseudo-Boolean solver.
cs.AI:To model combinatorial decision problems involving uncertainty and probability, we extend the stochastic constraint programming framework proposed in [Walsh, 2002] along a number of important dimensions (e.g. to multiple chance constraints and to a range of new objectives). We also provide a new (but equivalent) semantics based on scenarios. Using this semantics, we can compile stochastic constraint programs down into conventional (nonstochastic) constraint programs. This allows us to exploit the full power of existing constraint solvers. We have implemented this framework for decision making under uncertainty in stochastic OPL, a language which is based on the OPL constraint modelling language [Hentenryck et al., 1999]. To illustrate the potential of this framework, we model a wide range of problems in areas as diverse as finance, agriculture and production.
cs.AI:Many real life optimization problems contain both hard and soft constraints, as well as qualitative conditional preferences. However, there is no single formalism to specify all three kinds of information. We therefore propose a framework, based on both CP-nets and soft constraints, that handles both hard and soft constraints as well as conditional preferences efficiently and uniformly. We study the complexity of testing the consistency of preference statements, and show how soft constraints can faithfully approximate the semantics of conditional preference statements whilst improving the computational complexity
cs.AI:We identify a new and important global (or non-binary) constraint. This constraint ensures that the values taken by two vectors of variables, when viewed as multisets, are ordered. This constraint is useful for a number of different applications including breaking symmetry and fuzzy constraint satisfaction. We propose and implement an efficient linear time algorithm for enforcing generalised arc consistency on such a multiset ordering constraint. Experimental results on several problem domains show considerable promise.
cs.AI:We relate tag clouds to other forms of visualization, including planar or reduced dimensionality mapping, and Kohonen self-organizing maps. Using a modified tag cloud visualization, we incorporate other information into it, including text sequence and most pertinent words. Our notion of word pertinence goes beyond just word frequency and instead takes a word in a mathematical sense as located at the average of all of its pairwise relationships. We capture semantics through context, taken as all pairwise relationships. Our domain of application is that of filmscript analysis. The analysis of filmscripts, always important for cinema, is experiencing a major gain in importance in the context of television. Our objective in this work is to visualize the semantics of filmscript, and beyond filmscript any other partially structured, time-ordered, sequence of text segments. In particular we develop an innovative approach to plot characterization.
cs.AI:The paper proposes an analysis on some existent ontologies, in order to point out ways to resolve semantic heterogeneity in information systems. Authors are highlighting the tasks in a Knowledge Acquisiton System and identifying aspects related to the addition of new information to an intelligent system. A solution is proposed, as a combination of ontology reasoning services and natural languages generation. A multi-agent system will be conceived with an extractor agent, a reasoner agent and a competence management agent.
cs.AI:We have been developing a system for recognising human activity given a symbolic representation of video content. The input of our system is a set of time-stamped short-term activities detected on video frames. The output of our system is a set of recognised long-term activities, which are pre-defined temporal combinations of short-term activities. The constraints on the short-term activities that, if satisfied, lead to the recognition of a long-term activity, are expressed using a dialect of the Event Calculus. We illustrate the expressiveness of the dialect by showing the representation of several typical complex activities. Furthermore, we present a detailed evaluation of the system through experimentation on a benchmark dataset of surveillance videos.
cs.AI:People have to make important decisions within a time frame. Hence, it is imperative to employ means or strategy to aid effective decision making. Consequently, Economic Intelligence (EI) has emerged as a field to aid strategic and timely decision making in an organization. In the course of attaining this goal: it is indispensable to be more optimistic towards provision for conservation of intellectual resource invested into the process of decision making. This intellectual resource is nothing else but the knowledge of the actors as well as that of the various processes for effecting decision making. Knowledge has been recognized as a strategic economic resource for enhancing productivity and a key for innovation in any organization or community. Thus, its adequate management with cognizance of its temporal properties is highly indispensable. Temporal properties of knowledge refer to the date and time (known as timestamp) such knowledge is created as well as the duration or interval between related knowledge. This paper focuses on the needs for a user-centered knowledge management approach as well as exploitation of associated temporal properties. Our perspective of knowledge is with respect to decision-problems projects in EI. Our hypothesis is that the possibility of reasoning about temporal properties in exploitation of knowledge in EI projects should foster timely decision making through generation of useful inferences from available and reusable knowledge for a new project.
cs.AI:I discuss (ontologies_and_ontological_knowledge_bases / formal_methods_and_theories) duality and its category theory extensions as a step toward a solution to Knowledge-Based Systems Theory. In particular I focus on the example of the design of elements of ontologies and ontological knowledge bases of next three electronic courses: Foundations of Research Activities, Virtual Modeling of Complex Systems and Introduction to String Theory.
cs.AI:Mnesors are defined as elements of a semimodule over the min-plus integers. This two-sorted structure is able to merge graduation properties of vectors and idempotent properties of boolean numbers, which makes it appropriate for hybrid systems. We apply it to the control of an inverted pendulum and design a full logical controller, that is, without the usual algebra of real numbers.
cs.AI:We consider the following sequential decision problem. Given a set of items of unknown utility, we need to select one of as high a utility as possible (``the selection problem''). Measurements (possibly noisy) of item values prior to selection are allowed, at a known cost. The goal is to optimize the overall sequential decision process of measurements and selection.   Value of information (VOI) is a well-known scheme for selecting measurements, but the intractability of the problem typically leads to using myopic VOI estimates. In the selection problem, myopic VOI frequently badly underestimates the value of information, leading to inferior sensing plans. We relax the strict myopic assumption into a scheme we term semi-myopic, providing a spectrum of methods that can improve the performance of sensing plans. In particular, we propose the efficiently computable method of ``blinkered'' VOI, and examine theoretical bounds for special cases. Empirical evaluation of ``blinkered'' VOI in the selection problem with normally distributed item values shows that is performs much better than pure myopic VOI.
cs.AI:There are several well-known justifications for conditioning as the appropriate method for updating a single probability measure, given an observation. However, there is a significant body of work arguing for sets of probability measures, rather than single measures, as a more realistic model of uncertainty. Conditioning still makes sense in this context--we can simply condition each measure in the set individually, then combine the results--and, indeed, it seems to be the preferred updating procedure in the literature. But how justified is conditioning in this richer setting? Here we show, by considering an axiomatic account of conditioning given by van Fraassen, that the single-measure and sets-of-measures cases are very different. We show that van Fraassen's axiomatization for the former case is nowhere near sufficient for updating sets of measures. We give a considerably longer (and not as compelling) list of axioms that together force conditioning in this setting, and describe other update methods that are allowed once any of these axioms is dropped.
cs.AI:This paper presents a novel two-stage flexible dynamic decision support based optimal threat evaluation and defensive resource scheduling algorithm for multi-target air-borne threats. The algorithm provides flexibility and optimality by swapping between two objective functions, i.e. the preferential and subtractive defense strategies as and when required. To further enhance the solution quality, it outlines and divides the critical parameters used in Threat Evaluation and Weapon Assignment (TEWA) into three broad categories (Triggering, Scheduling and Ranking parameters). Proposed algorithm uses a variant of many-to-many Stable Marriage Algorithm (SMA) to solve Threat Evaluation (TE) and Weapon Assignment (WA) problem. In TE stage, Threat Ranking and Threat-Asset pairing is done. Stage two is based on a new flexible dynamic weapon scheduling algorithm, allowing multiple engagements using shoot-look-shoot strategy, to compute near-optimal solution for a range of scenarios. Analysis part of this paper presents the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm over an alternative greedy algorithm as applied to different offline scenarios.
cs.AI:Martin and Osswald \cite{Martin07} have recently proposed many generalizations of combination rules on quantitative beliefs in order to manage the conflict and to consider the specificity of the responses of the experts. Since the experts express themselves usually in natural language with linguistic labels, Smarandache and Dezert \cite{Li07} have introduced a mathematical framework for dealing directly also with qualitative beliefs. In this paper we recall some element of our previous works and propose the new combination rules, developed for the fusion of both qualitative or quantitative beliefs.
cs.AI:Surveillance control and reporting (SCR) system for air threats play an important role in the defense of a country. SCR system corresponds to air and ground situation management/processing along with information fusion, communication, coordination, simulation and other critical defense oriented tasks. Threat Evaluation and Weapon Assignment (TEWA) sits at the core of SCR system. In such a system, maximal or near maximal utilization of constrained resources is of extreme importance. Manual TEWA systems cannot provide optimality because of different limitations e.g.surface to air missile (SAM) can fire from a distance of 5Km, but manual TEWA systems are constrained by human vision range and other constraints. Current TEWA systems usually work on target-by-target basis using some type of greedy algorithm thus affecting the optimality of the solution and failing in multi-target scenario. his paper relates to a novel two-staged flexible dynamic decision support based optimal threat evaluation and weapon assignment algorithm for multi-target air-borne threats.
cs.AI:Collective graphical models exploit inter-instance associative dependence to output more accurate labelings. However existing models support very limited kind of associativity which restricts accuracy gains. This paper makes two major contributions. First, we propose a general collective inference framework that biases data instances to agree on a set of {\em properties} of their labelings. Agreement is encouraged through symmetric clique potentials. We show that rich properties leads to bigger gains, and present a systematic inference procedure for a large class of such properties. The procedure performs message passing on the cluster graph, where property-aware messages are computed with cluster specific algorithms. This provides an inference-only solution for domain adaptation. Our experiments on bibliographic information extraction illustrate significant test error reduction over unseen domains. Our second major contribution consists of algorithms for computing outgoing messages from clique clusters with symmetric clique potentials. Our algorithms are exact for arbitrary symmetric potentials on binary labels and for max-like and majority-like potentials on multiple labels. For majority potentials, we also provide an efficient Lagrangian Relaxation based algorithm that compares favorably with the exact algorithm. We present a 13/15-approximation algorithm for the NP-hard Potts potential, with runtime sub-quadratic in the clique size. In contrast, the best known previous guarantee for graphs with Potts potentials is only 1/2. We empirically show that our method for Potts potentials is an order of magnitude faster than the best alternatives, and our Lagrangian Relaxation based algorithm for majority potentials beats the best applicable heuristic -- ICM.
cs.AI:This research report presents an extension of Cumulative of Choco constraint solver, which is useful to encode over-constrained cumulative problems. This new global constraint uses sweep and task interval violation-based algorithms.
cs.AI:In this paper, we propose a first-order ontology for generalized stratified order structure. We then classify the models of the theory using model-theoretic techniques. An ontology mapping from this ontology to the core theory of Process Specification Language is also discussed.
cs.AI:The article presents a study of rather simple local search heuristics for the single machine total weighted tardiness problem (SMTWTP), namely hillclimbing and Variable Neighborhood Search. In particular, we revisit these approaches for the SMTWTP as there appears to be a lack of appropriate/challenging benchmark instances in this case. The obtained results are impressive indeed. Only few instances remain unsolved, and even those are approximated within 1% of the optimal/best known solutions. Our experiments support the claim that metaheuristics for the SMTWTP are very likely to lead to good results, and that, before refining search strategies, more work must be done with regard to the proposition of benchmark data. Some recommendations for the construction of such data sets are derived from our investigations.
cs.AI:The article describes the proposition and application of a local search metaheuristic for multi-objective optimization problems. It is based on two main principles of heuristic search, intensification through variable neighborhoods, and diversification through perturbations and successive iterations in favorable regions of the search space. The concept is successfully tested on permutation flow shop scheduling problems under multiple objectives and compared to other local search approaches. While the obtained results are encouraging in terms of their quality, another positive attribute of the approach is its simplicity as it does require the setting of only very few parameters.
cs.AI:This paper discusses "computational" systems capable of "computing" functions not computable by predefined Turing machines if the systems are not isolated from their environment. Roughly speaking, these systems can change their finite descriptions by interacting with their environment.
cs.AI:I propose that pattern recognition, memorization and processing are key concepts that can be a principle set for the theoretical modeling of the mind function. Most of the questions about the mind functioning can be answered by a descriptive modeling and definitions from these principles. An understandable consciousness definition can be drawn based on the assumption that a pattern recognition system can recognize its own patterns of activity. The principles, descriptive modeling and definitions can be a basis for theoretical and applied research on cognitive sciences, particularly at artificial intelligence studies.
cs.AI:The report gives an overview about activities on the topic Semantic Web. It has been released as technical report for the project "KTweb -- Connecting Knowledge Technologies Communities" in 2003.
cs.AI:Restart strategies are an important factor in the performance of conflict-driven Davis Putnam style SAT solvers. Selecting a good restart strategy for a problem instance can enhance the performance of a solver. Inspired by recent success applying machine learning techniques to predict the runtime of SAT solvers, we present a method which uses machine learning to boost solver performance through a smart selection of the restart strategy. Based on easy to compute features, we train both a satisfiability classifier and runtime models. We use these models to choose between restart strategies. We present experimental results comparing this technique with the most commonly used restart strategies. Our results demonstrate that machine learning is effective in improving solver performance.
cs.AI:We present two different methods for estimating the cost of solving SAT problems. The methods focus on the online behaviour of the backtracking solver, as well as the structure of the problem. Modern SAT solvers present several challenges to estimate search cost including coping with nonchronological backtracking, learning and restarts. Our first method adapt an existing algorithm for estimating the size of a search tree to deal with these challenges. We then suggest a second method that uses a linear model trained on data gathered online at the start of search. We compare the effectiveness of these two methods using random and structured problems. We also demonstrate that predictions made in early restarts can be used to improve later predictions. We conclude by showing that the cost of solving a set of problems can be reduced by selecting a solver from a portfolio based on such cost estimations.
cs.AI:Classification is the basis of cognition. Unlike other solutions, this study approaches it from the view of outliers. We present an expanding algorithm to detect outliers in univariate datasets, together with the underlying foundation. The expanding algorithm runs in a holistic way, making it a rather robust solution. Synthetic and real data experiments show its power. Furthermore, an application for multi-class problems leads to the introduction of the oscillator algorithm. The corresponding result implies the potential wide use of the expanding algorithm.
cs.AI:We consider a sequence of repeated interactions between an agent and an environment. Uncertainty about the environment is captured by a probability distribution over a space of hypotheses, which includes all computable functions. Given a utility function, we can evaluate the expected utility of any computational policy for interaction with the environment. After making some plausible assumptions (and maybe one not-so-plausible assumption), we show that if the utility function is unbounded, then the expected utility of any policy is undefined.
cs.AI:This study describes application of some approximate reasoning methods to analysis of hydrocyclone performance. In this manner, using a combining of Self Organizing Map (SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS)-SONFIS- and Rough Set Theory (RST)-SORST-crisp and fuzzy granules are obtained. Balancing of crisp granules and non-crisp granules can be implemented in close-open iteration. Using different criteria and based on granulation level balance point (interval) or a pseudo-balance point is estimated. Validation of the proposed methods, on the data set of the hydrocyclone is rendered.
cs.AI:In this paper we introduce two new DSm fusion conditioning rules with example, and as a generalization of them a class of DSm fusion conditioning rules, and then extend them to a class of DSm conditioning rules.
cs.AI:When implementing a propagator for a constraint, one must decide about variants: When implementing min, should one also implement max? Should one implement linear constraints both with unit and non-unit coefficients? Constraint variants are ubiquitous: implementing them requires considerable (if not prohibitive) effort and decreases maintainability, but will deliver better performance than resorting to constraint decomposition.   This paper shows how to use views to derive perfect propagator variants. A model for views and derived propagators is introduced. Derived propagators are proved to be indeed perfect in that they inherit essential properties such as correctness and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for systematically deriving propagators such as transformation, generalization, specialization, and type conversion are developed. The paper introduces an implementation architecture for views that is independent of the underlying constraint programming system. A detailed evaluation of views implemented in Gecode shows that derived propagators are efficient and that views often incur no overhead. Without views, Gecode would either require 180 000 rather than 40 000 lines of propagator code, or would lack many efficient propagator variants. Compared to 8 000 lines of code for views, the reduction in code for propagators yields a 1750% return on investment.
cs.AI:The explorative mind-map is a dynamic framework, that emerges automatically from the input, it gets. It is unlike a verificative modeling system where existing (human) thoughts are placed and connected together. In this regard, explorative mind-maps change their size continuously, being adaptive with connectionist cells inside; mind-maps process data input incrementally and offer lots of possibilities to interact with the user through an appropriate communication interface. With respect to a cognitive motivated situation like a conversation between partners, mind-maps become interesting as they are able to process stimulating signals whenever they occur. If these signals are close to an own understanding of the world, then the conversational partner becomes automatically more trustful than if the signals do not or less match the own knowledge scheme. In this (position) paper, we therefore motivate explorative mind-maps as a cognitive engine and propose these as a decision support engine to foster trust.
cs.AI:To capture the uncertainty of information or knowledge in information systems, various information granulations, also known as knowledge granulations, have been proposed. Recently, several axiomatic definitions of information granulation have been introduced. In this paper, we try to improve these axiomatic definitions and give a universal construction of information granulation by relating information granulations with a class of functions of multiple variables. We show that the improved axiomatic definition has some concrete information granulations in the literature as instances.
cs.AI:Current research on qualitative spatial representation and reasoning mainly focuses on one single aspect of space. In real world applications, however, multiple spatial aspects are often involved simultaneously.   This paper investigates problems arising in reasoning with combined topological and directional information. We use the RCC8 algebra and the Rectangle Algebra (RA) for expressing topological and directional information respectively. We give examples to show that the bipath-consistency algorithm BIPATH is incomplete for solving even basic RCC8 and RA constraints. If topological constraints are taken from some maximal tractable subclasses of RCC8, and directional constraints are taken from a subalgebra, termed DIR49, of RA, then we show that BIPATH is able to separate topological constraints from directional ones. This means, given a set of hybrid topological and directional constraints from the above subclasses of RCC8 and RA, we can transfer the joint satisfaction problem in polynomial time to two independent satisfaction problems in RCC8 and RA. For general RA constraints, we give a method to compute solutions that satisfy all topological constraints and approximately satisfy each RA constraint to any prescribed precision.
cs.AI:Direction relations between extended spatial objects are important commonsense knowledge. Recently, Goyal and Egenhofer proposed a formal model, known as Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), for representing direction relations between connected plane regions. CDC is perhaps the most expressive qualitative calculus for directional information, and has attracted increasing interest from areas such as artificial intelligence, geographical information science, and image retrieval. Given a network of CDC constraints, the consistency problem is deciding if the network is realizable by connected regions in the real plane. This paper provides a cubic algorithm for checking consistency of basic CDC constraint networks, and proves that reasoning with CDC is in general an NP-Complete problem. For a consistent network of basic CDC constraints, our algorithm also returns a 'canonical' solution in cubic time. This cubic algorithm is also adapted to cope with cardinal directions between possibly disconnected regions, in which case currently the best algorithm is of time complexity O(n^5).
cs.AI:In this paper, we address the problem of generating preferred plans by combining the procedural control knowledge specified by Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) with rich qualitative user preferences. The outcome of our work is a language for specifyin user preferences, tailored to HTN planning, together with a provably optimal preference-based planner, HTNPLAN, that is implemented as an extension of SHOP2. To compute preferred plans, we propose an approach based on forward-chaining heuristic search. Our heuristic uses an admissible evaluation function measuring the satisfaction of preferences over partial plans. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our HTNPLAN heuristics. We prove our approach sound and optimal with respect to the plans it generates by appealing to a situation calculus semantics of our preference language and of HTN planning. While our implementation builds on SHOP2, the language and techniques proposed here are relevant to a broad range of HTN planners.
cs.AI:We study the notion of informedness in a client-consultant setting. Using a software simulator, we examine the extent to which it pays off for consultants to provide their clients with advice that is well-informed, or with advice that is merely meant to appear to be well-informed. The latter strategy is beneficial in that it costs less resources to keep up-to-date, but carries the risk of a decreased reputation if the clients discover the low level of informedness of the consultant. Our experimental results indicate that under different circumstances, different strategies yield the optimal results (net profit) for the consultants.
cs.AI:We describe in this article a multiagent urban traffic simulation, as we believe individual-based modeling is necessary to encompass the complex influence the actions of an individual vehicle can have on the overall flow of vehicles. We first describe how we build a graph description of the network from purely geometric data, ESRI shapefiles. We then explain how we include traffic related data to this graph. We go on after that with the model of the vehicle agents: origin and destination, driving behavior, multiple lanes, crossroads, and interactions with the other vehicles in day-to-day, ?ordinary? traffic. We conclude with the presentation of the resulting simulation of this model on the Rouen agglomeration.
cs.AI:2007 was the first international congress on the ?square of oppositions?. A first attempt to structure debate using n-opposition theory was presented along with the results of a first experiment on the web. Our proposal for this paper is to define relations between arguments through a structure of opposition (square of oppositions is one structure of opposition). We will be trying to answer the following questions: How to organize debates on the web 2.0? How to structure them in a logical way? What is the role of n-opposition theory, in this context? We present in this paper results of three experiments (Betapolitique 2007, ECAP 2008, Intermed 2008).
cs.AI:We propose Interactive Differential Evolution (IDE) based on paired comparisons for reducing user fatigue and evaluate its convergence speed in comparison with Interactive Genetic Algorithms (IGA) and tournament IGA. User interface and convergence performance are two big keys for reducing Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) user fatigue. Unlike IGA and conventional IDE, users of the proposed IDE and tournament IGA do not need to compare whole individuals each other but compare pairs of individuals, which largely decreases user fatigue. In this paper, we design a pseudo-IEC user and evaluate another factor, IEC convergence performance, using IEC simulators and show that our proposed IDE converges significantly faster than IGA and tournament IGA, i.e. our proposed one is superior to others from both user interface and convergence performance points of view.
cs.AI:This paper describes application of information granulation theory, on the back analysis of Jeffrey mine southeast wall Quebec. In this manner, using a combining of Self Organizing Map (SOM) and rough set theory (RST), crisp and rough granules are obtained. Balancing of crisp granules and sub rough granules is rendered in close-open iteration. Combining of hard and soft computing, namely finite difference method (FDM) and computational intelligence and taking in to account missing information are two main benefits of the proposed method. As a practical example, reverse analysis on the failure of the southeast wall Jeffrey mine is accomplished.
cs.AI:Fault diagnosis has become a very important area of research during the last decade due to the advancement of mechanical and electrical systems in industries. The automobile is a crucial field where fault diagnosis is given a special attention. Due to the increasing complexity and newly added features in vehicles, a comprehensive study has to be performed in order to achieve an appropriate diagnosis model. A diagnosis system is capable of identifying the faults of a system by investigating the observable effects (or symptoms). The system categorizes the fault into a diagnosis class and identifies a probable cause based on the supplied fault symptoms. Fault categorization and identification are done using similarity matching techniques. The development of diagnosis classes is done by making use of previous experience, knowledge or information within an application area. The necessary information used may come from several sources of knowledge, such as from system analysis. In this paper similarity matching techniques for fault diagnosis in automotive infotainment applications are discussed.
cs.AI:Diverse recommendation techniques have been already proposed and encapsulated into several e-business applications, aiming to perform a more accurate evaluation of the existing information and accordingly augment the assistance provided to the users involved. This paper reports on the development and integration of a recommendation module in an agent-based transportation transactions management system. The module is built according to a novel hybrid recommendation technique, which combines the advantages of collaborative filtering and knowledge-based approaches. The proposed technique and supporting module assist customers in considering in detail alternative transportation transactions that satisfy their requests, as well as in evaluating completed transactions. The related services are invoked through a software agent that constructs the appropriate knowledge rules and performs a synthesis of the recommendation policy.
cs.AI:We study decompositions of NVALUE, a global constraint that can be used to model a wide range of problems where values need to be counted. Whilst decomposition typically hinders propagation, we identify one decomposition that maintains a global view as enforcing bound consistency on the decomposition achieves bound consistency on the original global NVALUE constraint. Such decompositions offer the prospect for advanced solving techniques like nogood learning and impact based branching heuristics. They may also help SAT and IP solvers take advantage of the propagation of global constraints.
cs.AI:Symmetry is an important feature of many constraint programs. We show that any symmetry acting on a set of symmetry breaking constraints can be used to break symmetry. Different symmetries pick out different solutions in each symmetry class. We use these observations in two methods for eliminating symmetry from a problem. These methods are designed to have many of the advantages of symmetry breaking methods that post static symmetry breaking constraint without some of the disadvantages. In particular, the two methods prune the search space using fast and efficient propagation of posted constraints, whilst reducing the conflict between symmetry breaking and branching heuristics. Experimental results show that the two methods perform well on some standard benchmarks.
cs.AI:Fuzzy constraints are a popular approach to handle preferences and over-constrained problems in scenarios where one needs to be cautious, such as in medical or space applications. We consider here fuzzy constraint problems where some of the preferences may be missing. This models, for example, settings where agents are distributed and have privacy issues, or where there is an ongoing preference elicitation process. In this setting, we study how to find a solution which is optimal irrespective of the missing preferences. In the process of finding such a solution, we may elicit preferences from the user if necessary. However, our goal is to ask the user as little as possible. We define a combined solving and preference elicitation scheme with a large number of different instantiations, each corresponding to a concrete algorithm which we compare experimentally. We compute both the number of elicited preferences and the "user effort", which may be larger, as it contains all the preference values the user has to compute to be able to respond to the elicitation requests. While the number of elicited preferences is important when the concern is to communicate as little information as possible, the user effort measures also the hidden work the user has to do to be able to communicate the elicited preferences. Our experimental results show that some of our algorithms are very good at finding a necessarily optimal solution while asking the user for only a very small fraction of the missing preferences. The user effort is also very small for the best algorithms. Finally, we test these algorithms on hard constraint problems with possibly missing constraints, where the aim is to find feasible solutions irrespective of the missing constraints.
cs.AI:We propose new filtering algorithms for the SEQUENCE constraint and some extensions of the SEQUENCE constraint based on network flows. We enforce domain consistency on the SEQUENCE constraint in $O(n^2)$ time down a branch of the search tree. This improves upon the best existing domain consistency algorithm by a factor of $O(\log n)$. The flows used in these algorithms are derived from a linear program. Some of them differ from the flows used to propagate global constraints like GCC since the domains of the variables are encoded as costs on the edges rather than capacities. Such flows are efficient for maintaining bounds consistency over large domains and may be useful for other global constraints.
cs.AI:We introduce the weighted CFG constraint and propose a propagation algorithm that enforces domain consistency in $O(n^3|G|)$ time. We show that this algorithm can be decomposed into a set of primitive arithmetic constraints without hindering propagation.
cs.AI:Many models in natural and social sciences are comprised of sets of inter-acting entities whose intensity of interaction decreases with distance. This often leads to structures of interest in these models composed of dense packs of entities. Fast Multipole Methods are a family of methods developed to help with the calculation of a number of computable models such as described above. We propose a method that builds upon FMM to detect and model the dense structures of these systems.
cs.AI:In Probabilistic Risk Management, risk is characterized by two quantities: the magnitude (or severity) of the adverse consequences that can potentially result from the given activity or action, and by the likelihood of occurrence of the given adverse consequences. But a risk seldom exists in isolation: chain of consequences must be examined, as the outcome of one risk can increase the likelihood of other risks. Systemic theory must complement classic PRM. Indeed these chains are composed of many different elements, all of which may have a critical importance at many different levels. Furthermore, when urban catastrophes are envisioned, space and time constraints are key determinants of the workings and dynamics of these chains of catastrophes: models must include a correct spatial topology of the studied risk. Finally, literature insists on the importance small events can have on the risk on a greater scale: urban risks management models belong to self-organized criticality theory. We chose multiagent systems to incorporate this property in our model: the behavior of an agent can transform the dynamics of important groups of them.
cs.AI:Constrained Optimum Path (COP) problems appear in many real-life applications, especially on communication networks. Some of these problems have been considered and solved by specific techniques which are usually difficult to extend. In this paper, we introduce a novel local search modeling for solving some COPs by local search. The modeling features the compositionality, modularity, reuse and strengthens the benefits of Constrained-Based Local Search. We also apply the modeling to the edge-disjoint paths problem (EDP). We show that side constraints can easily be added in the model. Computational results show the significance of the approach.
cs.AI:Using constraint-based local search, we effectively model and efficiently solve the problem of balancing the traffic demands on portions of the European airspace while ensuring that their capacity constraints are satisfied. The traffic demand of a portion of airspace is the hourly number of flights planned to enter it, and its capacity is the upper bound on this number under which air-traffic controllers can work. Currently, the only form of demand-capacity balancing we allow is ground holding, that is the changing of the take-off times of not yet airborne flights. Experiments with projected European flight plans of the year 2030 show that already this first form of demand-capacity balancing is feasible without incurring too much total delay and that it can lead to a significantly better demand-capacity balance.
cs.AI:Stochastic local search (SLS) has been an active field of research in the last few years, with new techniques and procedures being developed at an astonishing rate. SLS has been traditionally associated with satisfiability solving, that is, finding a solution for a given problem instance, as its intrinsic nature does not address unsatisfiable problems. Unsatisfiable instances were therefore commonly solved using backtrack search solvers. For this reason, in the late 90s Selman, Kautz and McAllester proposed a challenge to use local search instead to prove unsatisfiability. More recently, two SLS solvers - Ranger and Gunsat - have been developed, which are able to prove unsatisfiability albeit being SLS solvers. In this paper, we first compare Ranger with Gunsat and then propose to improve Ranger performance using some of Gunsat's techniques, namely unit propagation look-ahead and extended resolution.
cs.AI:This article introduces SatHyS (SAT HYbrid Solver), a novel hybrid approach for propositional satisfiability. It combines local search and conflict driven clause learning (CDCL) scheme. Each time the local search part reaches a local minimum, the CDCL is launched. For SAT problems it behaves like a tabu list, whereas for UNSAT ones, the CDCL part tries to focus on minimum unsatisfiable sub-formula (MUS). Experimental results show good performances on many classes of SAT instances from the last SAT competitions.
cs.AI:In this paper, we investigate the hybridization of constraint programming and local search techniques within a large neighbourhood search scheme for solving highly constrained nurse rostering problems. As identified by the research, a crucial part of the large neighbourhood search is the selection of the fragment (neighbourhood, i.e. the set of variables), to be relaxed and re-optimized iteratively. The success of the large neighbourhood search depends on the adequacy of this identified neighbourhood with regard to the problematic part of the solution assignment and the choice of the neighbourhood size. We investigate three strategies to choose the fragment of different sizes within the large neighbourhood search scheme. The first two strategies are tailored concerning the problem properties. The third strategy is more general, using the information of the cost from the soft constraint violations and their propagation as the indicator to choose the variables added into the fragment. The three strategies are analyzed and compared upon a benchmark nurse rostering problem. Promising results demonstrate the possibility of future work in the hybrid approach.
cs.AI:This paper presents a new method and a constraint-based objective function to solve two problems related to the design of optical telecommunication networks, namely the Synchronous Optical Network Ring Assignment Problem (SRAP) and the Intra-ring Synchronous Optical Network Design Problem (IDP). These network topology problems can be represented as a graph partitioning with capacity constraints as shown in previous works. We present here a new objective function and a new local search algorithm to solve these problems. Experiments conducted in Comet allow us to compare our method to previous ones and show that we obtain better results.
cs.AI:We explore the use of the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/BE for short) for combinatorial optimization applications: we present a parallel version of a constraint-based local search algorithm that has been implemented on a multiprocessor BladeCenter machine with twin Cell/BE processors (total of 16 SPUs per blade). This algorithm was chosen because it fits very well the Cell/BE architecture and requires neither shared memory nor communication between processors, while retaining a compact memory footprint. We study the performance on several large optimization benchmarks and show that this achieves mostly linear time speedups, even sometimes super-linear. This is possible because the parallel implementation might explore simultaneously different parts of the search space and therefore converge faster towards the best sub-space and thus towards a solution. Besides getting speedups, the resulting times exhibit a much smaller variance, which benefits applications where a timely reply is critical.
cs.AI:We explore the idea of using finite automata to implement new constraints for local search (this is already a successful technique in constraint-based global search). We show how it is possible to maintain incrementally the violations of a constraint and its decision variables from an automaton that describes a ground checker for that constraint. We establish the practicality of our approach idea on real-life personnel rostering problems, and show that it is competitive with the approach of [Pralong, 2007].
cs.AI:LSCS is a satellite workshop of the international conference on principles and practice of Constraint Programming (CP), since 2004. It is devoted to local search techniques in constraint satisfaction, and focuses on all aspects of local search techniques, including: design and implementation of new algorithms, hybrid stochastic-systematic search, reactive search optimization, adaptive search, modeling for local-search, global constraints, flexibility and robustness, learning methods, and specific applications.
cs.AI:In this paper the behavior of three combinational rules for temporal/sequential attribute data fusion for target type estimation are analyzed. The comparative analysis is based on: Dempster's fusion rule proposed in Dempster-Shafer Theory; Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule no. 5 (PCR5), proposed in Dezert-Smarandache Theory and one alternative class fusion rule, connecting the combination rules for information fusion with particular fuzzy operators, focusing on the t-norm based Conjunctive rule as an analog of the ordinary conjunctive rule and t-conorm based Disjunctive rule as an analog of the ordinary disjunctive rule. The way how different t-conorms and t-norms functions within TCN fusion rule influence over target type estimation performance is studied and estimated.
cs.AI:This paper proposes the application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to the problem of finite element model (FEM) selection. This problem arises when a choice of the best model for a system has to be made from set of competing models, each developed a priori from engineering judgment. PSO is a population-based stochastic search algorithm inspired by the behaviour of biological entities in nature when they are foraging for resources. Each potentially correct model is represented as a particle that exhibits both individualistic and group behaviour. Each particle moves within the model search space looking for the best solution by updating the parameters values that define it. The most important step in the particle swarm algorithm is the method of representing models which should take into account the number, location and variables of parameters to be updated. One example structural system is used to show the applicability of PSO in finding an optimal FEM. An optimal model is defined as the model that has the least number of updated parameters and has the smallest parameter variable variation from the mean material properties. Two different objective functions are used to compare performance of the PSO algorithm.
cs.AI:Motivated by Zadeh's paradigm of computing with words rather than numbers, several formal models of computing with words have recently been proposed. These models are based on automata and thus are not well-suited for concurrent computing. In this paper, we incorporate the well-known model of concurrent computing, Petri nets, together with fuzzy set theory and thereby establish a concurrency model of computing with words--fuzzy Petri nets for computing with words (FPNCWs). The new feature of such fuzzy Petri nets is that the labels of transitions are some special words modeled by fuzzy sets. By employing the methodology of fuzzy reasoning, we give a faithful extension of an FPNCW which makes it possible for computing with more words. The language expressiveness of the two formal models of computing with words, fuzzy automata for computing with words and FPNCWs, is compared as well. A few small examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical development.
cs.AI:Modelling emotion has become a challenge nowadays. Therefore, several models have been produced in order to express human emotional activity. However, only a few of them are currently able to express the close relationship existing between emotion and cognition. An appraisal-coping model is presented here, with the aim to simulate the emotional impact caused by the evaluation of a particular situation (appraisal), along with the consequent cognitive reaction intended to face the situation (coping). This model is applied to the "Cascades" problem, a small arithmetical exercise designed for ten-year-old pupils. The goal is to create a model corresponding to a child's behaviour when solving the problem using his own strategies.

cs.AI:Rough set theory, a mathematical tool to deal with inexact or uncertain knowledge in information systems, has originally described the indiscernibility of elements by equivalence relations. Covering rough sets are a natural extension of classical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to coverings. Recently, some topological concepts such as neighborhood have been applied to covering rough sets. In this paper, we further investigate the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods by approximation operations. We show that the upper approximation based on neighborhoods can be defined equivalently without using neighborhoods. To analyze the coverings themselves, we introduce unary and composition operations on coverings. A notion of homomorphismis provided to relate two covering approximation spaces. We also examine the properties of approximations preserved by the operations and homomorphisms, respectively.
cs.AI:In Pawlak's rough set theory, a set is approximated by a pair of lower and upper approximations. To measure numerically the roughness of an approximation, Pawlak introduced a quantitative measure of roughness by using the ratio of the cardinalities of the lower and upper approximations. Although the roughness measure is effective, it has the drawback of not being strictly monotonic with respect to the standard ordering on partitions. Recently, some improvements have been made by taking into account the granularity of partitions. In this paper, we approach the roughness measure in an axiomatic way. After axiomatically defining roughness measure and partition measure, we provide a unified construction of roughness measure, called strong Pawlak roughness measure, and then explore the properties of this measure. We show that the improved roughness measures in the literature are special instances of our strong Pawlak roughness measure and introduce three more strong Pawlak roughness measures as well. The advantage of our axiomatic approach is that some properties of a roughness measure follow immediately as soon as the measure satisfies the relevant axiomatic definition.
cs.AI:Adaptation has long been considered as the Achilles' heel of case-based reasoning since it requires some domain-specific knowledge that is difficult to acquire. In this paper, two strategies are combined in order to reduce the knowledge engineering cost induced by the adaptation knowledge (CA) acquisition task: CA is learned from the case base by the means of knowledge discovery techniques, and the CA acquisition sessions are opportunistically triggered, i.e., at problem-solving time.
cs.AI:Real-time heuristic search algorithms are suitable for situated agents that need to make their decisions in constant time. Since the original work by Korf nearly two decades ago, numerous extensions have been suggested. One of the most intriguing extensions is the idea of backtracking wherein the agent decides to return to a previously visited state as opposed to moving forward greedily. This idea has been empirically shown to have a significant impact on various performance measures. The studies have been carried out in particular empirical testbeds with specific real-time search algorithms that use backtracking. Consequently, the extent to which the trends observed are characteristic of backtracking in general is unclear. In this paper, we present the first entirely theoretical study of backtracking in real-time heuristic search. In particular, we present upper bounds on the solution cost exponential and linear in a parameter regulating the amount of backtracking. The results hold for a wide class of real-time heuristic search algorithms that includes many existing algorithms as a small subclass.
cs.AI:This paper presents several novel generalization bounds for the problem of learning kernels based on the analysis of the Rademacher complexity of the corresponding hypothesis sets. Our bound for learning kernels with a convex combination of p base kernels has only a log(p) dependency on the number of kernels, p, which is considerably more favorable than the previous best bound given for the same problem. We also give a novel bound for learning with a linear combination of p base kernels with an L_2 regularization whose dependency on p is only in p^{1/4}.
cs.AI:This paper formulates a necessary and sufficient condition for a generic graph matching problem to be equivalent to the maximum vertex and edge weight clique problem in a derived association graph. The consequences of this results are threefold: first, the condition is general enough to cover a broad range of practical graph matching problems; second, a proof to establish equivalence between graph matching and clique search reduces to showing that a given graph matching problem satisfies the proposed condition; and third, the result sets the scene for generic continuous solutions for a broad range of graph matching problems. To illustrate the mathematical framework, we apply it to a number of graph matching problems, including the problem of determining the graph edit distance.
cs.AI:This paper extends k-means algorithms from the Euclidean domain to the domain of graphs. To recompute the centroids, we apply subgradient methods for solving the optimization-based formulation of the sample mean of graphs. To accelerate the k-means algorithm for graphs without trading computational time against solution quality, we avoid unnecessary graph distance calculations by exploiting the triangle inequality of the underlying distance metric following Elkan's k-means algorithm proposed in \cite{Elkan03}. In experiments we show that the accelerated k-means algorithm are faster than the standard k-means algorithm for graphs provided there is a cluster structure in the data.
cs.AI:Traditional staging is based on a formal approach of similarity leaning on dramaturgical ontologies and instanciation variations. Inspired by interactive data mining, that suggests different approaches, we give an overview of computer science and theater researches using computers as partners of the actor to escape the a priori specification of roles.
cs.AI:We address the problem of belief change in (nonmonotonic) logic programming under answer set semantics. Unlike previous approaches to belief change in logic programming, our formal techniques are analogous to those of distance-based belief revision in propositional logic. In developing our results, we build upon the model theory of logic programs furnished by SE models. Since SE models provide a formal, monotonic characterisation of logic programs, we can adapt techniques from the area of belief revision to belief change in logic programs. We introduce methods for revising and merging logic programs, respectively. For the former, we study both subset-based revision as well as cardinality-based revision, and we show that they satisfy the majority of the AGM postulates for revision. For merging, we consider operators following arbitration merging and IC merging, respectively. We also present encodings for computing the revision as well as the merging of logic programs within the same logic programming framework, giving rise to a direct implementation of our approach in terms of off-the-shelf answer set solvers. These encodings reflect in turn the fact that our change operators do not increase the complexity of the base formalism.
cs.AI:Nearly 15 years ago, a set of qualitative spatial relations between oriented straight line segments (dipoles) was suggested by Schlieder. This work received substantial interest amongst the qualitative spatial reasoning community. However, it turned out to be difficult to establish a sound constraint calculus based on these relations. In this paper, we present the results of a new investigation into dipole constraint calculi which uses algebraic methods to derive sound results on the composition of relations and other properties of dipole calculi. Our results are based on a condensed semantics of the dipole relations.   In contrast to the points that are normally used, dipoles are extended and have an intrinsic direction. Both features are important properties of natural objects. This allows for a straightforward representation of prototypical reasoning tasks for spatial agents. As an example, we show how to generate survey knowledge from local observations in a street network. The example illustrates the fast constraint-based reasoning capabilities of the dipole calculus. We integrate our results into two reasoning tools which are publicly available.
cs.AI:In this paper we give a thorough presentation of a model proposed by Tononi et al. for modeling \emph{integrated information}, i.e. how much information is generated in a system transitioning from one state to the next one by the causal interaction of its parts and \emph{above and beyond} the information given by the sum of its parts. We also provides a more general formulation of such a model, independent from the time chosen for the analysis and from the uniformity of the probability distribution at the initial time instant. Finally, we prove that integrated information is null for disconnected systems.
cs.AI:Vector quantization(VQ) is a lossy data compression technique from signal processing, which is restricted to feature vectors and therefore inapplicable for combinatorial structures. This contribution presents a theoretical foundation of graph quantization (GQ) that extends VQ to the domain of attributed graphs. We present the necessary Lloyd-Max conditions for optimality of a graph quantizer and consistency results for optimal GQ design based on empirical distortion measures and stochastic optimization. These results statistically justify existing clustering algorithms in the domain of graphs. The proposed approach provides a template of how to link structural pattern recognition methods other than GQ to statistical pattern recognition.
cs.AI:Human decisional processes result from the employment of selected quantities of relevant information, generally synthesized from environmental incoming data and stored memories. Their main goal is the production of an appropriate and adaptive response to a cognitive or behavioral task. Different strategies of response production can be adopted, among which haphazard trials, formation of mental schemes and heuristics. In this paper, we propose a model of Boolean neural network that incorporates these strategies by recurring to global optimization strategies during the learning session. The model characterizes as well the passage from an unstructured/chaotic attractor neural network typical of data-driven processes to a faster one, forward-only and representative of schema-driven processes. Moreover, a simplified version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is introduced in order to test the model. Our results match with experimental data and point out some relevant knowledge coming from psychological domain.
cs.AI:Internet and expert systems have offered new ways of sharing and distributing knowledge, but there is a lack of researches in the area of web based expert systems. This paper introduces a development of a web-based expert system for the regulations of civil service in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia named as RCSES. It is the first time to develop such system (application of civil service regulations) as well the development of it using web based approach. The proposed system considers 17 regulations of the civil service system. The different phases of developing the RCSES system are presented, as knowledge acquiring and selection, ontology and knowledge representations using XML format. XML Rule-based knowledge sources and the inference mechanisms were implemented using ASP.net technique. An interactive tool for entering the ontology and knowledge base, and the inferencing was built. It gives the ability to use, modify, update, and extend the existing knowledge base in an easy way. The knowledge was validated by experts in the domain of civil service regulations, and the proposed RCSES was tested, verified, and validated by different technical users and the developers staff. The RCSES system is compared with other related web based expert systems, that comparison proved the goodness, usability, and high performance of RCSES.
cs.AI:Many engineering optimization problems can be considered as linear programming problems where all or some of the parameters involved are linguistic in nature. These can only be quantified using fuzzy sets. The aim of this paper is to solve a fuzzy linear programming problem in which the parameters involved are fuzzy quantities with logistic membership functions. To explore the applicability of the method a numerical example is considered to determine the monthly production planning quotas and profit of a home textile group.
cs.AI:Mamdani Fuzzy Model is an important technique in Computational Intelligence (CI) study. This paper presents an implementation of a supervised learning method based on membership function training in the context of Mamdani fuzzy models. Specifically, auto zoom function of a digital camera is modelled using Mamdani technique. The performance of control method is verified through a series of simulation and numerical results are provided as illustrations.
cs.AI:In this book we introduce a new procedure called \alpha-Discounting Method for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (\alpha-D MCDM), which is as an alternative and extension of Saaty Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It works for any number of preferences that can be transformed into a system of homogeneous linear equations. A degree of consistency (and implicitly a degree of inconsistency) of a decision-making problem are defined. \alpha-D MCDM is afterwards generalized to a set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of linear and or non-linear homogeneous and or non-homogeneous equations and or inequalities. The general idea of \alpha-D MCDM is to assign non-null positive parameters \alpha_1, \alpha_2, and so on \alpha_p to the coefficients in the right-hand side of each preference that diminish or increase them in order to transform the above linear homogeneous system of equations which has only the null-solution, into a system having a particular non-null solution. After finding the general solution of this system, the principles used to assign particular values to all parameters \alpha is the second important part of \alpha-D, yet to be deeper investigated in the future. In the current book we propose the Fairness Principle, i.e. each coefficient should be discounted with the same percentage (we think this is fair: not making any favoritism or unfairness to any coefficient), but the reader can propose other principles. For consistent decision-making problems with pairwise comparisons, \alpha-Discounting Method together with the Fairness Principle give the same result as AHP. But for weak inconsistent decision-making problem, \alpha-Discounting together with the Fairness Principle give a different result from AHP. Many consistent, weak inconsistent, and strong inconsistent examples are given in this book.
cs.AI:This paper proposes a design for a system to generate constraint solvers that are specialised for specific problem models. It describes the design in detail and gives preliminary experimental results showing the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.
cs.AI:Machine Consciousness is the study of consciousness in a biological, philosophical, mathematical and physical perspective and designing a model that can fit into a programmable system architecture. Prime objective of the study is to make the system architecture behave consciously like a biological model does. Present work has developed a feasible definition of consciousness, that characterizes consciousness with four parameters i.e., parasitic, symbiotic, self referral and reproduction. Present work has also developed a biologically inspired consciousness architecture that has following layers: quantum layer, cellular layer, organ layer and behavioral layer and traced the characteristics of consciousness at each layer. Finally, the work has estimated physical and algorithmic architecture to devise a system that can behave consciously.
cs.AI:To study the communication between information systems, Wang et al. [C. Wang, C. Wu, D. Chen, Q. Hu, and C. Wu, Communicating between information systems, Information Sciences 178 (2008) 3228-3239] proposed two concepts of type-1 and type-2 consistent functions. Some properties of such functions and induced relation mappings have been investigated there. In this paper, we provide an improvement of the aforementioned work by disclosing the symmetric relationship between type-1 and type-2 consistent functions. We present more properties of consistent functions and induced relation mappings and improve upon several deficient assertions in the original work. In particular, we unify and extend type-1 and type-2 consistent functions into the so-called neighborhood-consistent functions. This provides a convenient means for studying the communication between information systems based on various neighborhoods.
cs.AI:Recently, Wang et al. discussed the properties of fuzzy information systems under homomorphisms in the paper [C. Wang, D. Chen, L. Zhu, Homomorphisms between fuzzy information systems, Applied Mathematics Letters 22 (2009) 1045-1050], where homomorphisms are based upon the concepts of consistent functions and fuzzy relation mappings. In this paper, we classify consistent functions as predecessor-consistent and successor-consistent, and then proceed to present more properties of consistent functions. In addition, we improve some characterizations of fuzzy relation mappings provided by Wang et al.
cs.AI:In this paper, research on AI based modeling technique to optimize development of new alloys with necessitated improvements in properties and chemical mixture over existing alloys as per functional requirements of product is done. The current research work novels AI in lieu of predictions to establish association between material and product customary. Advanced computational simulation techniques like CFD, FEA interrogations are made viable to authenticate product dynamics in context to experimental investigations. Accordingly, the current research is focused towards binding relationships between material design and product design domains. The input to feed forward back propagation prediction network model constitutes of material design features. Parameters relevant to product design strategies are furnished as target outputs. The outcomes of ANN shows good sign of correlation between material and product design domains. The study enriches a new path to illustrate material factors at the time of new product development.
cs.AI:Currently, criminals profile (CP) is obtained from investigators or forensic psychologists interpretation, linking crime scene characteristics and an offenders behavior to his or her characteristics and psychological profile. This paper seeks an efficient and systematic discovery of nonobvious and valuable patterns between variables from a large database of solved cases via a probabilistic network (PN) modeling approach. The PN structure can be used to extract behavioral patterns and to gain insight into what factors influence these behaviors. Thus, when a new case is being investigated and the profile variables are unknown because the offender has yet to be identified, the observed crime scene variables are used to infer the unknown variables based on their connections in the structure and the corresponding numerical (probabilistic) weights. The objective is to produce a more systematic and empirical approach to profiling, and to use the resulting PN model as a decision tool.
cs.AI:Constraint programming can definitely be seen as a model-driven paradigm. The users write programs for modeling problems. These programs are mapped to executable models to calculate the solutions. This paper focuses on efficient model management (definition and transformation). From this point of view, we propose to revisit the design of constraint-programming systems. A model-driven architecture is introduced to map solving-independent constraint models to solving-dependent decision models. Several important questions are examined, such as the need for a visual highlevel modeling language, and the quality of metamodeling techniques to implement the transformations. A main result is the s-COMMA platform that efficiently implements the chain from modeling to solving constraint problems
cs.AI:An important challenge in constraint programming is to rewrite constraint models into executable programs calculat- ing the solutions. This phase of constraint processing may require translations between constraint programming lan- guages, transformations of constraint representations, model optimizations, and tuning of solving strategies. In this paper, we introduce a pivot metamodel describing the common fea- tures of constraint models including different kinds of con- straints, statements like conditionals and loops, and other first-class elements like object classes and predicates. This metamodel is general enough to cope with the constructions of many languages, from object-oriented modeling languages to logic languages, but it is independent from them. The rewriting operations manipulate metamodel instances apart from languages. As a consequence, the rewriting operations apply whatever languages are selected and they are able to manage model semantic information. A bridge is created between the metamodel space and languages using parsing techniques. Tools from the software engineering world can be useful to implement this framework.
cs.AI:Transforming constraint models is an important task in re- cent constraint programming systems. User-understandable models are defined during the modeling phase but rewriting or tuning them is manda- tory to get solving-efficient models. We propose a new architecture al- lowing to define bridges between any (modeling or solver) languages and to implement model optimizations. This architecture follows a model- driven approach where the constraint modeling process is seen as a set of model transformations. Among others, an interesting feature is the def- inition of transformations as concept-oriented rules, i.e. based on types of model elements where the types are organized into a hierarchy called a metamodel.
cs.AI:The methodology of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is applied for assessment of newborn brain maturity from sleep EEG. In theory this methodology provides the most accurate assessments of uncertainty in decisions. However, the existing BMA techniques have been shown providing biased assessments in the absence of some prior information enabling to explore model parameter space in details within a reasonable time. The lack in details leads to disproportional sampling from the posterior distribution. In case of the EEG assessment of brain maturity, BMA results can be biased because of the absence of information about EEG feature importance. In this paper we explore how the posterior information about EEG features can be used in order to reduce a negative impact of disproportional sampling on BMA performance. We use EEG data recorded from sleeping newborns to test the efficiency of the proposed BMA technique.
cs.AI:In this paper we describe an original computational model for solving different types of Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DCSP). The proposed model is called Controller-Agents for Constraints Solving (CACS). This model is intended to be used which is an emerged field from the integration between two paradigms of different nature: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Constraint Satisfaction Problem paradigm (CSP) where all constraints are treated in central manner as a black-box. This model allows grouping constraints to form a subset that will be treated together as a local problem inside the controller. Using this model allows also handling non-binary constraints easily and directly so that no translating of constraints into binary ones is needed. This paper presents the implementation outlines of a prototype of DCSP solver, its usage methodology and overview of the CACS application for timetabling problems.
cs.AI:Model transformations operate on models conforming to precisely defined metamodels. Consequently, it often seems relatively easy to chain them: the output of a transformation may be given as input to a second one if metamodels match. However, this simple rule has some obvious limitations. For instance, a transformation may only use a subset of a metamodel. Therefore, chaining transformations appropriately requires more information. We present here an approach that automatically discovers more detailed information about actual chaining constraints by statically analyzing transformations. The objective is to provide developers who decide to chain transformations with more data on which to base their choices. This approach has been successfully applied to the case of a library of endogenous transformations. They all have the same source and target metamodel but have some hidden chaining constraints. In such a case, the simple metamodel matching rule given above does not provide any useful information.
cs.AI:This article presents the results of the research carried out on the development of a medical diagnostic system applied to the Acute Bacterial Meningitis, using the Case Based Reasoning methodology. The research was focused on the implementation of the adaptation stage, from the integration of Case Based Reasoning and Rule Based Expert Systems. In this adaptation stage we use a higher level RBC that stores and allows reutilizing change experiences, combined with a classic rule-based inference engine. In order to take into account the most evident clinical situation, a pre-diagnosis stage is implemented using a rule engine that, given an evident situation, emits the corresponding diagnosis and avoids the complete process.
cs.AI:Recent advancement in web services plays an important role in business to business and business to consumer interaction. Discovery mechanism is not only used to find a suitable service but also provides collaboration between service providers and consumers by using standard protocols. A static web service discovery mechanism is not only time consuming but requires continuous human interaction. This paper proposed an efficient dynamic web services discovery mechanism that can locate relevant and updated web services from service registries and repositories with timestamp based on indexing value and categorization for faster and efficient discovery of service. The proposed prototype focuses on quality of service issues and introduces concept of local cache, categorization of services, indexing mechanism, CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) solver, aging and usage of translator. Performance of proposed framework is evaluated by implementing the algorithm and correctness of our method is shown. The results of proposed framework shows greater performance and accuracy in dynamic discovery mechanism of web services resolving the existing issues of flexibility, scalability, based on quality of service, and discovers updated and most relevant services with ease of usage.
cs.AI:Fuzzy Description Logics (DLs) are a family of logics which allow the representation of (and the reasoning with) structured knowledge affected by vagueness. Although most of the not very expressive crisp DLs, such as ALC, enjoy the Finite Model Property (FMP), this is not the case once we move into the fuzzy case. In this paper we show that if we allow arbitrary knowledge bases, then the fuzzy DLs ALC under Lukasiewicz and Product fuzzy logics do not verify the FMP even if we restrict to witnessed models; in other words, finite satisfiability and witnessed satisfiability are different for arbitrary knowledge bases. The aim of this paper is to point out the failure of FMP because it affects several algorithms published in the literature for reasoning under fuzzy ALC.
cs.AI:The basic aim of our study is to give a possible model for handling uncertain information. This model is worked out in the framework of DATALOG. At first the concept of fuzzy Datalog will be summarized, then its extensions for intuitionistic- and interval-valued fuzzy logic is given and the concept of bipolar fuzzy Datalog is introduced. Based on these ideas the concept of multivalued knowledge-base will be defined as a quadruple of any background knowledge; a deduction mechanism; a connecting algorithm, and a function set of the program, which help us to determine the uncertainty levels of the results. At last a possible evaluation strategy is given.
cs.AI:RefereeToolbox is a java package implementing combination operators for fusing evidences. It is downloadable from: http://refereefunction.fredericdambreville.com/releases RefereeToolbox is based on an interpretation of the fusion rules by means of Referee Functions. This approach implies a dissociation between the definition of the combination and its actual implementation, which is common to all referee-based combinations. As a result, RefereeToolbox is designed with the aim to be generic and evolutive.
cs.AI:LEXSYS, (Legume Expert System) was a project conceived at IITA (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture) Ibadan Nigeria. It was initiated by the COMBS (Collaborative Group on Maize-Based Systems Research in the 1990. It was meant for a general framework for characterizing on-farm testing for technology design for sustainable cereal-based cropping system. LEXSYS is not a true expert system as the name would imply, but simply a user-friendly information system. This work is an attempt to give a formal representation of the existing system and then present areas where intelligent agent can be applied.
cs.AI:Computing value of information (VOI) is a crucial task in various aspects of decision-making under uncertainty, such as in meta-reasoning for search; in selecting measurements to make, prior to choosing a course of action; and in managing the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff. Since such applications typically require numerous VOI computations during a single run, it is essential that VOI be computed efficiently. We examine the issue of anytime estimation of VOI, as frequently it suffices to get a crude estimate of the VOI, thus saving considerable computational resources. As a case study, we examine VOI estimation in the measurement selection problem. Empirical evaluation of the proposed scheme in this domain shows that computational resources can indeed be significantly reduced, at little cost in expected rewards achieved in the overall decision problem.
cs.AI:Formalism based on GA is an alternative to distributed representation models developed so far --- Smolensky's tensor product, Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) and Binary Spatter Code (BSC). Convolutions are replaced by geometric products, interpretable in terms of geometry which seems to be the most natural language for visualization of higher concepts. This paper recalls the main ideas behind the GA model and investigates recognition test results using both inner product and a clipped version of matrix representation. The influence of accidental blade equality on recognition is also studied. Finally, the efficiency of the GA model is compared to that of previously developed models.
cs.AI:We present in this paper some examples of how to compute by hand the PCR5 fusion rule for three sources, so the reader will better understand its mechanism. We also take into consideration the importance of sources, which is different from the classical discounting of sources.
cs.AI:Terrorism has led to many problems in Thai societies, not only property damage but also civilian casualties. Predicting terrorism activities in advance can help prepare and manage risk from sabotage by these activities. This paper proposes a framework focusing on event classification in terrorism domain using fuzzy inference systems (FISs). Each FIS is a decision-making model combining fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning. It is generated in five main parts: the input interface, the fuzzification interface, knowledge base unit, decision making unit and output defuzzification interface. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a FIS model adapted by combining the fuzzy logic and neural network. The ANFIS utilizes automatic identification of fuzzy logic rules and adjustment of membership function (MF). Moreover, neural network can directly learn from data set to construct fuzzy logic rules and MF implemented in various applications. FIS settings are evaluated based on two comparisons. The first evaluation is the comparison between unstructured and structured events using the same FIS setting. The second comparison is the model settings between FIS and ANFIS for classifying structured events. The data set consists of news articles related to terrorism events in three southern provinces of Thailand. The experimental results show that the classification performance of the FIS resulting from structured events achieves satisfactory accuracy and is better than the unstructured events. In addition, the classification of structured events using ANFIS gives higher performance than the events using only FIS in the prediction of terrorism events.
cs.AI:Most of the web user's requirements are search or navigation time and getting correctly matched result. These constrains can be satisfied with some additional modules attached to the existing search engines and web servers. This paper proposes that powerful architecture for search engines with the title of Probabilistic Semantic Web Mining named from the methods used. With the increase of larger and larger collection of various data resources on the World Wide Web (WWW), Web Mining has become one of the most important requirements for the web users. Web servers will store various formats of data including text, image, audio, video etc., but servers can not identify the contents of the data. These search techniques can be improved by adding some special techniques including semantic web mining and probabilistic analysis to get more accurate results. Semantic web mining technique can provide meaningful search of data resources by eliminating useless information with mining process. In this technique web servers will maintain Meta information of each and every data resources available in that particular web server. This will help the search engine to retrieve information that is relevant to user given input string. This paper proposing the idea of combing these two techniques Semantic web mining and Probabilistic analysis for efficient and accurate search results of web mining. SPF can be calculated by considering both semantic accuracy and syntactic accuracy of data with the input string. This will be the deciding factor for producing results.
cs.AI:The Nystrom method is an efficient technique to speed up large-scale learning applications by generating low-rank approximations. Crucial to the performance of this technique is the assumption that a matrix can be well approximated by working exclusively with a subset of its columns. In this work we relate this assumption to the concept of matrix coherence and connect matrix coherence to the performance of the Nystrom method. Making use of related work in the compressed sensing and the matrix completion literature, we derive novel coherence-based bounds for the Nystrom method in the low-rank setting. We then present empirical results that corroborate these theoretical bounds. Finally, we present more general empirical results for the full-rank setting that convincingly demonstrate the ability of matrix coherence to measure the degree to which information can be extracted from a subset of columns.
cs.AI:We define the concept of an internal symmetry. This is a symmety within a solution of a constraint satisfaction problem. We compare this to solution symmetry, which is a mapping between different solutions of the same problem. We argue that we may be able to exploit both types of symmetry when finding solutions. We illustrate the potential of exploiting internal symmetries on two benchmark domains: Van der Waerden numbers and graceful graphs. By identifying internal symmetries we are able to extend the state of the art in both cases.
cs.AI:We study propagation algorithms for the conjunction of two AllDifferent constraints. Solutions of an AllDifferent constraint can be seen as perfect matchings on the variable/value bipartite graph. Therefore, we investigate the problem of finding simultaneous bipartite matchings. We present an extension of the famous Hall theorem which characterizes when simultaneous bipartite matchings exists. Unfortunately, finding such matchings is NP-hard in general. However, we prove a surprising result that finding a simultaneous matching on a convex bipartite graph takes just polynomial time. Based on this theoretical result, we provide the first polynomial time bound consistency algorithm for the conjunction of two AllDifferent constraints. We identify a pathological problem on which this propagator is exponentially faster compared to existing propagators. Our experiments show that this new propagator can offer significant benefits over existing methods.
cs.AI:The successful execution of a construction project is heavily impacted by making the right decision during tendering processes. Managing tender procedures is very complex and uncertain involving coordination of many tasks and individuals with different priorities and objectives. Bias and inconsistent decision are inevitable if the decision-making process is totally depends on intuition, subjective judgement or emotion. In making transparent decision and healthy competition tendering, there exists a need for flexible guidance tool for decision support. Aim of this paper is to give a review on current practices of Decision Support Systems (DSS) technology in construction tendering processes. Current practices of general tendering processes as applied to the most countries in different regions such as United States, Europe, Middle East and Asia are comprehensively discussed. Applications of Web-based tendering processes is also summarised in terms of its properties. Besides that, a summary of Decision Support System (DSS) components is included in the next section. Furthermore, prior researches on implementation of DSS approaches in tendering processes are discussed in details. Current issues arise from both of paper-based and Web-based tendering processes are outlined. Finally, conclusion is included at the end of this paper.
cs.AI:The need for integration of ontologies with nonmonotonic rules has been gaining importance in a number of areas, such as the Semantic Web. A number of researchers addressed this problem by proposing a unified semantics for hybrid knowledge bases composed of both an ontology (expressed in a fragment of first-order logic) and nonmonotonic rules. These semantics have matured over the years, but only provide solutions for the static case when knowledge does not need to evolve. In this paper we take a first step towards addressing the dynamics of hybrid knowledge bases. We focus on knowledge updates and, considering the state of the art of belief update, ontology update and rule update, we show that current solutions are only partial and difficult to combine. Then we extend the existing work on ABox updates with rules, provide a semantics for such evolving hybrid knowledge bases and study its basic properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an update operator is proposed for hybrid knowledge bases.
cs.AI:On the basis of an analysis of previous research, we present a generalized approach for measuring the difference of plans with an exemplary application to machine scheduling. Our work is motivated by the need for such measures, which are used in dynamic scheduling and planning situations. In this context, quantitative approaches are needed for the assessment of the robustness and stability of schedules. Obviously, any `robustness' or `stability' of plans has to be defined w. r. t. the particular situation and the requirements of the human decision maker. Besides the proposition of an instability measure, we therefore discuss possibilities of obtaining meaningful information from the decision maker for the implementation of the introduced approach.
cs.AI:We define an inference system to capture explanations based on causal statements, using an ontology in the form of an IS-A hierarchy. We first introduce a simple logical language which makes it possible to express that a fact causes another fact and that a fact explains another fact. We present a set of formal inference patterns from causal statements to explanation statements. We introduce an elementary ontology which gives greater expressiveness to the system while staying close to propositional reasoning. We provide an inference system that captures the patterns discussed, firstly in a purely propositional framework, then in a datalog (limited predicate) framework.
cs.AI:We report (to our knowledge) the first evaluation of Constraint Satisfaction as a computational framework for solving closest string problems. We show that careful consideration of symbol occurrences can provide search heuristics that provide several orders of magnitude speedup at and above the optimal distance. We also report (to our knowledge) the first analysis and evaluation -- using any technique -- of the computational difficulties involved in the identification of all closest strings for a given input set. We describe algorithms for web-scale distributed solution of closest string problems, both purely based on AI backtrack search and also hybrid numeric-AI methods.
cs.AI:We consider the problem of jointly training structured models for extraction from sources whose instances enjoy partial overlap. This has important applications like user-driven ad-hoc information extraction on the web. Such applications present new challenges in terms of the number of sources and their arbitrary pattern of overlap not seen by earlier collective training schemes applied on two sources. We present an agreement-based learning framework and alternatives within it to trade-off tractability, robustness to noise, and extent of agreement. We provide a principled scheme to discover low-noise agreement sets in unlabeled data across the sources. Through extensive experiments over 58 real datasets, we establish that our method of additively rewarding agreement over maximal segments of text provides the best trade-offs, and also scores over alternatives such as collective inference, staged training, and multi-view learning.
cs.AI:A technique to study the dynamics of solving of a research task is suggested. The research task was based on specially developed software Right- Wrong Responder (RWR), with the participants having to reveal the response logic of the program. The participants interacted with the program in the form of a semi-binary dialogue, which implies the feedback responses of only two kinds - "right" or "wrong". The technique has been applied to a small pilot group of volunteer participants. Some of them have successfully solved the task (solvers) and some have not (non-solvers). In the beginning of the work, the solvers did more wrong moves than non-solvers, and they did less wrong moves closer to the finish of the work. A phase portrait of the work both in solvers and non-solvers showed definite cycles that may correspond to sequences of partially true hypotheses that may be formulated by the participants during the solving of the task.
cs.AI:This paper constructively proves the existence of an effective procedure generating a computable (total) function that is not contained in any given effectively enumerable set of such functions. The proof implies the existence of machines that process informal concepts such as computable (total) functions beyond the limits of any given Turing machine or formal system, that is, these machines can, in a certain sense, "compute" function values beyond these limits. We call these machines creative. We argue that any "intelligent" machine should be capable of processing informal concepts such as computable (total) functions, that is, it should be creative. Finally, we introduce hypotheses on creative machines which were developed on the basis of theoretical investigations and experiments with computer programs. The hypotheses say that machine intelligence is the execution of a self-developing procedure starting from any universal programming language and any input.
cs.AI:Mountain river torrents and snow avalanches generate human and material damages with dramatic consequences. Knowledge about natural phenomenona is often lacking and expertise is required for decision and risk management purposes using multi-disciplinary quantitative or qualitative approaches. Expertise is considered as a decision process based on imperfect information coming from more or less reliable and conflicting sources. A methodology mixing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi-criteria aid-decision method, and information fusion using Belief Function Theory is described. Fuzzy Sets and Possibilities theories allow to transform quantitative and qualitative criteria into a common frame of discernment for decision in Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST ) and Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) contexts. Main issues consist in basic belief assignments elicitation, conflict identification and management, fusion rule choices, results validation but also in specific needs to make a difference between importance and reliability and uncertainty in the fusion process.
cs.AI:A lot of mathematical knowledge has been formalized and stored in repositories by now: different mathematical theorems and theories have been taken into consideration and included in mathematical repositories. Applications more distant from pure mathematics, however --- though based on these theories --- often need more detailed knowledge about the underlying theories. In this paper we present an example Mizar formalization from the area of electrical engineering focusing on stability theory which is based on complex analysis. We discuss what kind of special knowledge is necessary here and which amount of this knowledge is included in existing repositories.
cs.AI:It is hypothesized that creativity arises from the self-mending capacity of an internal model of the world, or worldview. The uniquely honed worldview of a creative individual results in a distinctive style that is recognizable within and across domains. It is further hypothesized that creativity is domaingeneral in the sense that there exist multiple avenues by which the distinctiveness of one's worldview can be expressed. These hypotheses were tested using art students and creative writing students. Art students guessed significantly above chance both which painting was done by which of five famous artists, and which artwork was done by which of their peers. Similarly, creative writing students guessed significantly above chance both which passage was written by which of five famous writers, and which passage was written by which of their peers. These findings support the hypothesis that creative style is recognizable. Moreover, creative writing students guessed significantly above chance which of their peers produced particular works of art, supporting the hypothesis that creative style is recognizable not just within but across domains.
cs.AI:Approximate dynamic programming has been used successfully in a large variety of domains, but it relies on a small set of provided approximation features to calculate solutions reliably. Large and rich sets of features can cause existing algorithms to overfit because of a limited number of samples. We address this shortcoming using $L_1$ regularization in approximate linear programming. Because the proposed method can automatically select the appropriate richness of features, its performance does not degrade with an increasing number of features. These results rely on new and stronger sampling bounds for regularized approximate linear programs. We also propose a computationally efficient homotopy method. The empirical evaluation of the approach shows that the proposed method performs well on simple MDPs and standard benchmark problems.
cs.AI:We discuss how to use a Genetic Regulatory Network as an evolutionary representation to solve a typical GP reinforcement problem, the pole balancing. The network is a modified version of an Artificial Regulatory Network proposed a few years ago, and the task could be solved only by finding a proper way of connecting inputs and outputs to the network. We show that the representation is able to generalize well over the problem domain, and discuss the performance of different models of this kind.
cs.AI:Programs to solve so-called constraint problems are complex pieces of software which require many design decisions to be made more or less arbitrarily by the implementer. These decisions affect the performance of the finished solver significantly. Once a design decision has been made, it cannot easily be reversed, although a different decision may be more appropriate for a particular problem.   We investigate using machine learning to make these decisions automatically depending on the problem to solve with the alldifferent constraint as an example. Our system is capable of making non-trivial, multi-level decisions that improve over always making a default choice.
cs.AI:In this paper the author presents a kind of Soft Computing Technique, mainly an application of fuzzy set theory of Prof. Zadeh [16], on a problem of Medical Experts Systems. The choosen problem is on design of a physician's decision model which can take crisp as well as fuzzy data as input, unlike the traditional models. The author presents a mathematical model based on fuzzy set theory for physician aided evaluation of a complete representation of information emanating from the initial interview including patient past history, present symptoms, and signs observed upon physical examination and results of clinical and diagnostic tests.
cs.AI:An important problem in computational social choice theory is the complexity of undesirable behavior among agents, such as control, manipulation, and bribery in election systems. These kinds of voting strategies are often tempting at the individual level but disastrous for the agents as a whole. Creating election systems where the determination of such strategies is difficult is thus an important goal.   An interesting set of elections is that of scoring protocols. Previous work in this area has demonstrated the complexity of misuse in cases involving a fixed number of candidates, and of specific election systems on unbounded number of candidates such as Borda. In contrast, we take the first step in generalizing the results of computational complexity of election misuse to cases of infinitely many scoring protocols on an unbounded number of candidates. Interesting families of systems include $k$-approval and $k$-veto elections, in which voters distinguish $k$ candidates from the candidate set.   Our main result is to partition the problems of these families based on their complexity. We do so by showing they are polynomial-time computable, NP-hard, or polynomial-time equivalent to another problem of interest. We also demonstrate a surprising connection between manipulation in election systems and some graph theory problems.
cs.AI:In the last two decades, a number of methods have been proposed for forecasting based on fuzzy time series. Most of the fuzzy time series methods are presented for forecasting of car road accidents. However, the forecasting accuracy rates of the existing methods are not good enough. In this paper, we compared our proposed new method of fuzzy time series forecasting with existing methods. Our method is based on means based partitioning of the historical data of car road accidents. The proposed method belongs to the kth order and time-variant methods. The proposed method can get the best forecasting accuracy rate for forecasting the car road accidents than the existing methods.
cs.AI:In this paper, a new learning algorithm for adaptive network intrusion detection using naive Bayesian classifier and decision tree is presented, which performs balance detections and keeps false positives at acceptable level for different types of network attacks, and eliminates redundant attributes as well as contradictory examples from training data that make the detection model complex. The proposed algorithm also addresses some difficulties of data mining such as handling continuous attribute, dealing with missing attribute values, and reducing noise in training data. Due to the large volumes of security audit data as well as the complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviours, several data miningbased intrusion detection techniques have been applied to network-based traffic data and host-based data in the last decades. However, there remain various issues needed to be examined towards current intrusion detection systems (IDS). We tested the performance of our proposed algorithm with existing learning algorithms by employing on the KDD99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. The experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm achieved high detection rates (DR) and significant reduce false positives (FP) for different types of network intrusions using limited computational resources.
cs.AI:This paper presents a combination of several automated reasoning and proof presentation tools with the Mizar system for formalization of mathematics. The combination forms an online service called MizAR, similar to the SystemOnTPTP service for first-order automated reasoning. The main differences to SystemOnTPTP are the use of the Mizar language that is oriented towards human mathematicians (rather than the pure first-order logic used in SystemOnTPTP), and setting the service in the context of the large Mizar Mathematical Library of previous theorems,definitions, and proofs (rather than the isolated problems that are solved in SystemOnTPTP). These differences poses new challenges and new opportunities for automated reasoning and for proof presentation tools. This paper describes the overall structure of MizAR, and presents the automated reasoning systems and proof presentation tools that are combined to make MizAR a useful mathematical service.
cs.AI:Structured and semi-structured data describing entities, taxonomies and ontologies appears in many domains. There is a huge interest in integrating structured information from multiple sources; however integrating structured data to infer complex common structures is a difficult task because the integration must aggregate similar structures while avoiding structural inconsistencies that may appear when the data is combined. In this work, we study the integration of structured social metadata: shallow personal hierarchies specified by many individual users on the SocialWeb, and focus on inferring a collection of integrated, consistent taxonomies. We frame this task as an optimization problem with structural constraints. We propose a new inference algorithm, which we refer to as Relational Affinity Propagation (RAP) that extends affinity propagation (Frey and Dueck 2007) by introducing structural constraints. We validate the approach on a real-world social media dataset, collected from the photosharing website Flickr. Our empirical results show that our proposed approach is able to construct deeper and denser structures compared to an approach using only the standard affinity propagation algorithm.
cs.AI:The paper offers a mathematical formalization of the Turing test. This formalization makes it possible to establish the conditions under which some Turing machine will pass the Turing test and the conditions under which every Turing machine (or every Turing machine of the special class) will fail the Turing test.
cs.AI:Many social Web sites allow users to annotate the content with descriptive metadata, such as tags, and more recently to organize content hierarchically. These types of structured metadata provide valuable evidence for learning how a community organizes knowledge. For instance, we can aggregate many personal hierarchies into a common taxonomy, also known as a folksonomy, that will aid users in visualizing and browsing social content, and also to help them in organizing their own content. However, learning from social metadata presents several challenges, since it is sparse, shallow, ambiguous, noisy, and inconsistent. We describe an approach to folksonomy learning based on relational clustering, which exploits structured metadata contained in personal hierarchies. Our approach clusters similar hierarchies using their structure and tag statistics, then incrementally weaves them into a deeper, bushier tree. We study folksonomy learning using social metadata extracted from the photo-sharing site Flickr, and demonstrate that the proposed approach addresses the challenges. Moreover, comparing to previous work, the approach produces larger, more accurate folksonomies, and in addition, scales better.
cs.AI:Symmetry is an important feature of many constraint programs. We show that any problem symmetry acting on a set of symmetry breaking constraints can be used to break symmetry. Different symmetries pick out different solutions in each symmetry class. This simple but powerful idea can be used in a number of different ways. We describe one application within model restarts, a search technique designed to reduce the conflict between symmetry breaking and the branching heuristic. In model restarts, we restart search periodically with a random symmetry of the symmetry breaking constraints. Experimental results show that this symmetry breaking technique is effective in practice on some standard benchmark problems.
cs.AI:We propose automatically learning probabilistic Hierarchical Task Networks (pHTNs) in order to capture a user's preferences on plans, by observing only the user's behavior. HTNs are a common choice of representation for a variety of purposes in planning, including work on learning in planning. Our contributions are (a) learning structure and (b) representing preferences. In contrast, prior work employing HTNs considers learning method preconditions (instead of structure) and representing domain physics or search control knowledge (rather than preferences). Initially we will assume that the observed distribution of plans is an accurate representation of user preference, and then generalize to the situation where feasibility constraints frequently prevent the execution of preferred plans. In order to learn a distribution on plans we adapt an Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique from the discipline of (probabilistic) grammar induction, taking the perspective of task reductions as productions in a context-free grammar over primitive actions. To account for the difference between the distributions of possible and preferred plans we subsequently modify this core EM technique, in short, by rescaling its input.
cs.AI:Brain-Like Stochastic Search (BLiSS) refers to this task: given a family of utility functions U(u,A), where u is a vector of parameters or task descriptors, maximize or minimize U with respect to u, using networks (Option Nets) which input A and learn to generate good options u stochastically. This paper discusses why this is crucial to brain-like intelligence (an area funded by NSF) and to many applications, and discusses various possibilities for network design and training. The appendix discusses recent research, relations to work on stochastic optimization in operations research, and relations to engineering-based approaches to understanding neocortex.
cs.AI:We introduce a framework for representing a variety of interesting problems as inference over the execution of probabilistic model programs. We represent a "solution" to such a problem as a guide program which runs alongside the model program and influences the model program's random choices, leading the model program to sample from a different distribution than from its priors. Ideally the guide program influences the model program to sample from the posteriors given the evidence. We show how the KL- divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution induced by the guided model program can be efficiently estimated (up to an additive constant) by sampling multiple executions of the guided model program. In addition, we show how to use the guide program as a proposal distribution in importance sampling to statistically prove lower bounds on the probability of the evidence and on the probability of a hypothesis and the evidence. We can use the quotient of these two bounds as an estimate of the conditional probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. We thus turn the inference problem into a heuristic search for better guide programs.
cs.AI:The basic unit of meaning on the Semantic Web is the RDF statement, or triple, which combines a distinct subject, predicate and object to make a definite assertion about the world. A set of triples constitutes a graph, to which they give a collective meaning. It is upon this simple foundation that the rich, complex knowledge structures of the Semantic Web are built. Yet the very expressiveness of RDF, by inviting comparison with real-world knowledge, highlights a fundamental shortcoming, in that RDF is limited to statements of absolute fact, independent of the context in which a statement is asserted. This is in stark contrast with the thoroughly context-sensitive nature of human thought. The model presented here provides a particularly simple means of contextualizing an RDF triple by associating it with related statements in the same graph. This approach, in combination with a notion of graph similarity, is sufficient to select only those statements from an RDF graph which are subjectively most relevant to the context of the requesting process.
cs.AI:In this Information system age many organizations consider information system as their weapon to compete or gain competitive advantage or give the best services for non profit organizations. Game Information System as combining Information System and game is breakthrough to achieve organizations' performance. The Game Information System will run the Information System with game and how game can be implemented to run the Information System. Game is not only for fun and entertainment, but will be a challenge to combine fun and entertainment with Information System. The Challenge to run the information system with entertainment, deliver the entertainment with information system all at once. Game information system can be implemented in many sectors as like the information system itself but in difference's view. A view of game which people can joy and happy and do their transaction as a fun things.
cs.AI:In order to get strategic positioning for competition in business organization, the information system must be ahead in this information age where the information as one of the weapons to win the competition and in the right hand the information will become a right bullet. The information system with the information technology support isn't enough if just only on internet or implemented with internet technology. The growth of information technology as tools for helping and making people easy to use must be accompanied by wanting to make fun and happy when they make contact with the information technology itself. Basically human like to play, since childhood human have been playing, free and happy and when human grow up they can't play as much as when human was in their childhood. We have to develop the information system which is not perform information system itself but can help human to explore their natural instinct for playing, making fun and happiness when they interact with the information system. Virtual information system is the way to present playing and having fun atmosphere on working area.
cs.AI:Earthquake DSS is an information technology environment which can be used by government to sharpen, make faster and better the earthquake mitigation decision. Earthquake DSS can be delivered as E-government which is not only for government itself but in order to guarantee each citizen's rights for education, training and information about earthquake and how to overcome the earthquake. Knowledge can be managed for future use and would become mining by saving and maintain all the data and information about earthquake and earthquake mitigation in Indonesia. Using Web technology will enhance global access and easy to use. Datawarehouse as unNormalized database for multidimensional analysis will speed the query process and increase reports variation. Link with other Disaster DSS in one national disaster DSS, link with other government information system and international will enhance the knowledge and sharpen the reports.
cs.AI:Markov decision processes (MDPs) are widely used for modeling decision-making problems in robotics, automated control, and economics. Traditional MDPs assume that the decision maker (DM) knows all states and actions. However, this may not be true in many situations of interest. We define a new framework, MDPs with unawareness (MDPUs) to deal with the possibilities that a DM may not be aware of all possible actions. We provide a complete characterization of when a DM can learn to play near-optimally in an MDPU, and give an algorithm that learns to play near-optimally when it is possible to do so, as efficiently as possible. In particular, we characterize when a near-optimal solution can be found in polynomial time.
cs.AI:Existing value function approximation methods have been successfully used in many applications, but they often lack useful a priori error bounds. We propose a new approximate bilinear programming formulation of value function approximation, which employs global optimization. The formulation provides strong a priori guarantees on both robust and expected policy loss by minimizing specific norms of the Bellman residual. Solving a bilinear program optimally is NP-hard, but this is unavoidable because the Bellman-residual minimization itself is NP-hard. We describe and analyze both optimal and approximate algorithms for solving bilinear programs. The analysis shows that this algorithm offers a convergent generalization of approximate policy iteration. We also briefly analyze the behavior of bilinear programming algorithms under incomplete samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can consistently minimize the Bellman residual on simple benchmark problems.
cs.AI:Different notions of equivalence, such as the prominent notions of strong and uniform equivalence, have been studied in Answer-Set Programming, mainly for the purpose of identifying programs that can serve as substitutes without altering the semantics, for instance in program optimization. Such semantic comparisons are usually characterized by various selections of models in the logic of Here-and-There (HT). For uniform equivalence however, correct characterizations in terms of HT-models can only be obtained for finite theories, respectively programs. In this article, we show that a selection of countermodels in HT captures uniform equivalence also for infinite theories. This result is turned into coherent characterizations of the different notions of equivalence by countermodels, as well as by a mixture of HT-models and countermodels (so-called equivalence interpretations). Moreover, we generalize the so-called notion of relativized hyperequivalence for programs to propositional theories, and apply the same methodology in order to obtain a semantic characterization which is amenable to infinite settings. This allows for a lifting of the results to first-order theories under a very general semantics given in terms of a quantified version of HT. We thus obtain a general framework for the study of various notions of equivalence for theories under answer-set semantics. Moreover, we prove an expedient property that allows for a simplified treatment of extended signatures, and provide further results for non-ground logic programs. In particular, uniform equivalence coincides under open and ordinary answer-set semantics, and for finite non-ground programs under these semantics, also the usual characterization of uniform equivalence in terms of maximal and total HT-models of the grounding is correct, even for infinite domains, when corresponding ground programs are infinite.
cs.AI:Human disease diagnosis is a complicated process and requires high level of expertise. Any attempt of developing a web-based expert system dealing with human disease diagnosis has to overcome various difficulties. This paper describes a project work aiming to develop a web-based fuzzy expert system for diagnosing human diseases. Now a days fuzzy systems are being used successfully in an increasing number of application areas; they use linguistic rules to describe systems. This research project focuses on the research and development of a web-based clinical tool designed to improve the quality of the exchange of health information between health care professionals and patients. Practitioners can also use this web-based tool to corroborate diagnosis. The proposed system is experimented on various scenarios in order to evaluate it's performance. In all the cases, proposed system exhibits satisfactory results.
cs.AI:In the area of computer science focusing on creating machines that can engage on behaviors that humans consider intelligent. The ability to create intelligent machines has intrigued humans since ancient times and today with the advent of the computer and 50 years of research into various programming techniques, the dream of smart machines is becoming a reality. Researchers are creating systems which can mimic human thought, understand speech, beat the best human chessplayer, and countless other feats never before possible. Ability of the human to estimate the information is most brightly shown in using of natural languages. Using words of a natural language for valuation qualitative attributes, for example, the person pawns uncertainty in form of vagueness in itself estimations. Vague sets, vague judgments, vague conclusions takes place there and then, where and when the reasonable subject exists and also is interested in something. The vague sets theory has arisen as the answer to an illegibility of language the reasonable subject speaks. Language of a reasonable subject is generated by vague events which are created by the reason and which are operated by the mind. The theory of vague sets represents an attempt to find such approximation of vague grouping which would be more convenient, than the classical theory of sets in situations where the natural language plays a significant role. Such theory has been offered by known American mathematician Gau and Buehrer .In our paper we are describing how vagueness of linguistic variables can be solved by using the vague set theory.This paper is mainly designed for one of directions of the eventology (the theory of the random vague events), which has arisen within the limits of the probability theory and which pursue the unique purpose to describe eventologically a movement of reason.
cs.AI:Ontologies usually suffer from the semantic heterogeneity when simultaneously used in information sharing, merging, integrating and querying processes. Therefore, the similarity identification between ontologies being used becomes a mandatory task for all these processes to handle the problem of semantic heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique for similarity measurement between two ontologies. The proposed technique identifies all candidate pairs of similar concepts without omitting any similar pair. The proposed technique can be used in different types of operations on ontologies such as merging, mapping and aligning. By analyzing its results a reasonable improvement in terms of completeness, correctness and overall quality of the results has been found.
cs.AI:Many formal languages have been proposed to express or represent Ontologies, including RDF, RDFS, DAML+OIL and OWL. Most of these languages are based on XML syntax, but with various terminologies and expressiveness. Therefore, choosing a language for building an Ontology is the main step. The main point of choosing language to represent Ontology is based mainly on what the Ontology will represent or be used for. That language should have a range of quality support features such as ease of use, expressive power, compatibility, sharing and versioning, internationalisation. This is because different kinds of knowledge-based applications need different language features. The main objective of these languages is to add semantics to the existing information on the web. The aims of this paper is to provide a good knowledge of existing language and understanding of these languages and how could be used.
cs.AI:Semantic Web is actually an extension of the current one in that it represents information more meaningfully for humans and computers alike. It enables the description of contents and services in machine-readable form, and enables annotating, discovering, publishing, advertising and composing services to be automated. It was developed based on Ontology, which is considered as the backbone of the Semantic Web. In other words, the current Web is transformed from being machine-readable to machine-understandable. In fact, Ontology is a key technique with which to annotate semantics and provide a common, comprehensible foundation for resources on the Semantic Web. Moreover, Ontology can provide a common vocabulary, a grammar for publishing data, and can supply a semantic description of data which can be used to preserve the Ontologies and keep them ready for inference. This paper provides basic concepts of web services and the Semantic Web, defines the structure and the main applications of ontology, and provides many relevant terms are explained in order to provide a basic understanding of ontologies.
cs.AI:Finding the structure of a graphical model has been received much attention in many fields. Recently, it is reported that the non-Gaussianity of data enables us to identify the structure of a directed acyclic graph without any prior knowledge on the structure. In this paper, we propose a novel non-Gaussianity based algorithm for more general type of models; chain graphs. The algorithm finds an ordering of the disjoint subsets of variables by iteratively evaluating the independence between the variable subset and the residuals when the remaining variables are regressed on those. However, its computational cost grows exponentially according to the number of variables. Therefore, we further discuss an efficient approximate approach for applying the algorithm to large sized graphs. We illustrate the algorithm with artificial and real-world datasets.
cs.AI:Notions of core, support and inversion of a soft set have been defined and studied. Soft approximations are soft sets developed through core and support, and are used for granulating the soft space. Membership structure of a soft set has been probed in and many interesting properties presented. The mathematical apparatus developed so far in this paper yields a detailed analysis of two works viz. [N. Cagman, S. Enginoglu, Soft set theory and uni-int decision making, European Jr. of Operational Research (article in press, available online 12 May 2010)] and [N. Cagman, S. Enginoglu, Soft matrix theory and its decision making, Computers and Mathematics with Applications 59 (2010) 3308 - 3314.]. We prove (Theorem 8.1) that uni-int method of Cagman is equivalent to a core-support expression which is computationally far less expansive than uni-int. This also highlights some shortcomings in Cagman's uni-int method and thus motivates us to improve the method. We first suggest an improvement in uni-int method and then present a new conjecture to solve the optimum choice problem given by Cagman and Enginoglu. Our Example 8.6 presents a case where the optimum choice is intuitively clear yet both uni-int methods (Cagman's and our improved one) give wrong answer but the new conjecture solves the problem correctly.
cs.AI:In recent years there has been growing interest in solutions for the delivery of clinical care for the elderly, due to the large increase in aging population. Monitoring a patient in his home environment is necessary to ensure continuity of care in home settings, but, to be useful, this activity must not be too invasive for patients and a burden for caregivers. We prototyped a system called SINDI (Secure and INDependent lIving), focused on i) collecting a limited amount of data about the person and the environment through Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and ii) inferring from these data enough information to support caregivers in understanding patients' well being and in predicting possible evolutions of their health. Our hierarchical logic-based model of health combines data from different sources, sensor data, tests results, common-sense knowledge and patient's clinical profile at the lower level, and correlation rules between health conditions across upper levels. The logical formalization and the reasoning process are based on Answer Set Programming. The expressive power of this logic programming paradigm makes it possible to reason about health evolution even when the available information is incomplete and potentially incoherent, while declarativity simplifies rules specification by caregivers and allows automatic encoding of knowledge. This paper describes how these issues have been targeted in the application scenario of the SINDI system.
cs.AI:Iris recognition technology, used to identify individuals by photographing the iris of their eye, has become popular in security applications because of its ease of use, accuracy, and safety in controlling access to high-security areas. Fusion of multiple algorithms for biometric verification performance improvement has received considerable attention. The proposed method combines the zero-crossing 1 D wavelet Euler number, and genetic algorithm based for feature extraction. The output from these three algorithms is normalized and their score are fused to decide whether the user is genuine or imposter. This new strategies is discussed in this paper, in order to compute a multimodal combined score.
cs.AI:We study decompositions of the global NVALUE constraint. Our main contribution is theoretical: we show that there are propagators for global constraints like NVALUE which decomposition can simulate with the same time complexity but with a much greater space complexity. This suggests that the benefit of a global propagator may often not be in saving time but in saving space. Our other theoretical contribution is to show for the first time that range consistency can be enforced on NVALUE with the same worst-case time complexity as bound consistency. Finally, the decompositions we study are readily encoded as linear inequalities. We are therefore able to use them in integer linear programs.
cs.AI:Symmetry can be used to help solve many problems. For instance, Einstein's famous 1905 paper ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") uses symmetry to help derive the laws of special relativity. In artificial intelligence, symmetry has played an important role in both problem representation and reasoning. I describe recent work on using symmetry to help solve constraint satisfaction problems. Symmetries occur within individual solutions of problems as well as between different solutions of the same problem. Symmetry can also be applied to the constraints in a problem to give new symmetric constraints. Reasoning about symmetry can speed up problem solving, and has led to the discovery of new results in both graph and number theory.
cs.AI:We propose an online form of the cake cutting problem. This models situations where players arrive and depart during the process of dividing a resource. We show that well known fair division procedures like cut-and-choose and the Dubins-Spanier moving knife procedure can be adapted to apply to such online problems. We propose some desirable properties that online cake cutting procedures might possess like online forms of proportionality and envy-freeness, and identify which properties are in fact possessed by the different online cake procedures.
cs.AI:The stable marriage problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools, or more generally to any two-sided market. We consider a useful variation of the stable marriage problem, where the men and women express their preferences using a preference list with ties over a subset of the members of the other sex. Matchings are permitted only with people who appear in these preference lists. In this setting, we study the problem of finding a stable matching that marries as many people as possible. Stability is an envy-free notion: no man and woman who are not married to each other would both prefer each other to their partners or to being single. This problem is NP-hard. We tackle this problem using local search, exploiting properties of the problem to reduce the size of the neighborhood and to make local moves efficiently. Experimental results show that this approach is able to solve large problems, quickly returning stable matchings of large and often optimal size.
cs.AI:Frequent Episode Discovery framework is a popular framework in Temporal Data Mining with many applications. Over the years many different notions of frequencies of episodes have been proposed along with different algorithms for episode discovery. In this paper we present a unified view of all such frequency counting algorithms. We present a generic algorithm such that all current algorithms are special cases of it. This unified view allows one to gain insights into different frequencies and we present quantitative relationships among different frequencies. Our unified view also helps in obtaining correctness proofs for various algorithms as we show here. We also point out how this unified view helps us to consider generalization of the algorithm so that they can discover episodes with general partial orders.
cs.AI:The stable marriage (SM) problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools, or more generally to any two-sided market. In the classical formulation, n men and n women express their preferences (via a strict total order) over the members of the other sex. Solving a SM problem means finding a stable marriage where stability is an envy-free notion: no man and woman who are not married to each other would both prefer each other to their partners or to being single. We consider both the classical stable marriage problem and one of its useful variations (denoted SMTI) where the men and women express their preferences in the form of an incomplete preference list with ties over a subset of the members of the other sex. Matchings are permitted only with people who appear in these lists, an we try to find a stable matching that marries as many people as possible. Whilst the SM problem is polynomial to solve, the SMTI problem is NP-hard. We propose to tackle both problems via a local search approach, which exploits properties of the problems to reduce the size of the neighborhood and to make local moves efficiently. We evaluate empirically our algorithm for SM problems by measuring its runtime behaviour and its ability to sample the lattice of all possible stable marriages. We evaluate our algorithm for SMTI problems in terms of both its runtime behaviour and its ability to find a maximum cardinality stable marriage.For SM problems, the number of steps of our algorithm grows only as O(nlog(n)), and that it samples very well the set of all stable marriages. It is thus a fair and efficient approach to generate stable marriages.Furthermore, our approach for SMTI problems is able to solve large problems, quickly returning stable matchings of large and often optimal size despite the NP-hardness of this problem.
cs.AI:From the advent of the application of satellite imagery to land cover mapping, one of the growing areas of research interest has been in the area of image classification. Image classifiers are algorithms used to extract land cover information from satellite imagery. Most of the initial research has focussed on the development and application of algorithms to better existing and emerging classifiers. In this paper, a paradigm shift is proposed whereby a committee of classifiers is used to determine the final classification output. Two of the key components of an ensemble system are that there should be diversity among the classifiers and that there should be a mechanism through which the results are combined. In this paper, the members of the ensemble system include: Linear SVM, Gaussian SVM and Quadratic SVM. The final output was determined through a simple majority vote of the individual classifiers. From the results obtained it was observed that the final derived map generated by an ensemble system can potentially improve on the results derived from the individual classifiers making up the ensemble system. The ensemble system classification accuracy was, in this case, better than the linear and quadratic SVM result. It was however less than that of the RBF SVM. Areas for further research could focus on improving the diversity of the ensemble system used in this research.
cs.AI:A general method is given for revising degrees of belief and arriving at consistent decisions about a system of logically constrained issues. In contrast to other works about belief revision, here the constraints are assumed to be fixed. The method has two variants, dual of each other, whose revised degrees of belief are respectively above and below the original ones. The upper [resp. lower] revised degrees of belief are uniquely characterized as the lowest [resp. highest] ones that are invariant by a certain max-min [resp. min-max] operation determined by the logical constraints. In both variants, making balance between the revised degree of belief of a proposition and that of its negation leads to decisions that are ensured to be consistent with the logical constraints. These decisions are ensured to agree with the majority criterion as applied to the original degrees of belief whenever this gives a consistent result. They are also also ensured to satisfy a property of respect for unanimity about any particular issue, as well as a property of monotonicity with respect to the original degrees of belief. The application of the method to certain special domains comes down to well established or increasingly accepted methods, such as the single-link method of cluster analysis and the method of paths in preferential voting.
cs.AI:Strategic Environmental Assessment is a procedure aimed at introducing systematic assessment of the environmental effects of plans and programs. This procedure is based on the so-called coaxial matrices that define dependencies between plan activities (infrastructures, plants, resource extractions, buildings, etc.) and positive and negative environmental impacts, and dependencies between these impacts and environmental receptors. Up to now, this procedure is manually implemented by environmental experts for checking the environmental effects of a given plan or program, but it is never applied during the plan/program construction. A decision support system, based on a clear logic semantics, would be an invaluable tool not only in assessing a single, already defined plan, but also during the planning process in order to produce an optimized, environmentally assessed plan and to study possible alternative scenarios. We propose two logic-based approaches to the problem, one based on Constraint Logic Programming and one on Probabilistic Logic Programming that could be, in the future, conveniently merged to exploit the advantages of both. We test the proposed approaches on a real energy plan and we discuss their limitations and advantages.
cs.AI:Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases are one of the most prominent tightly integrated combinations of open-world ontology languages with closed-world (non-monotonic) rule paradigms. The definition of Hybrid MKNF is parametric on the description logic (DL) underlying the ontology language, in the sense that non-monotonic rules can extend any decidable DL language. Two related semantics have been defined for Hybrid MKNF: one that is based on the Stable Model Semantics for logic programs and one on the Well-Founded Semantics (WFS). Under WFS, the definition of Hybrid MKNF relies on a bottom-up computation that has polynomial data complexity whenever the DL language is tractable. Here we define a general query-driven procedure for Hybrid MKNF that is sound with respect to the stable model-based semantics, and sound and complete with respect to its WFS variant. This procedure is able to answer a slightly restricted form of conjunctive queries, and is based on tabled rule evaluation extended with an external oracle that captures reasoning within the ontology. Such an (abstract) oracle receives as input a query along with knowledge already derived, and replies with a (possibly empty) set of atoms, defined in the rules, whose truth would suffice to prove the initial query. With appropriate assumptions on the complexity of the abstract oracle, the general procedure maintains the data complexity of the WFS for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.   To illustrate this approach, we provide a concrete oracle for EL+, a fragment of the light-weight DL EL++. Such an oracle has practical use, as EL++ is the language underlying OWL 2 EL, which is part of the W3C recommendations for the Semantic Web, and is tractable for reasoning tasks such as subsumption. We show that query-driven Hybrid MKNF preserves polynomial data complexity when using the EL+ oracle and WFS.
cs.AI:Answer set programming - the most popular problem solving paradigm based on logic programs - has been recently extended to support uninterpreted function symbols. All of these approaches have some limitation. In this paper we propose a class of programs called FP2 that enjoys a different trade-off between expressiveness and complexity. FP2 programs enjoy the following unique combination of properties: (i) the ability of expressing predicates with infinite extensions; (ii) full support for predicates with arbitrary arity; (iii) decidability of FP2 membership checking; (iv) decidability of skeptical and credulous stable model reasoning for call-safe queries. Odd cycles are supported by composing FP2 programs with argument restricted programs.
cs.AI:This paper models a decision support system to predict the occurance of suicide attack in a given collection of cities. The system comprises two parts. First part analyzes and identifies the factors which affect the prediction. Admitting incomplete information and use of linguistic terms by experts, as two characteristic features of this peculiar prediction problem we exploit the Theory of Fuzzy Soft Sets. Hence the Part 2 of the model is an algorithm vz. FSP which takes the assessment of factors given in Part 1 as its input and produces a possibility profile of cities likely to receive the accident. The algorithm is of O(2^n) complexity. It has been illustrated by an example solved in detail. Simulation results for the algorithm have been presented which give insight into the strengths and weaknesses of FSP. Three different decision making measures have been simulated and compared in our discussion.
cs.AI:An approach to the revision of logic programs under the answer set semantics is presented. For programs P and Q, the goal is to determine the answer sets that correspond to the revision of P by Q, denoted P * Q. A fundamental principle of classical (AGM) revision, and the one that guides the approach here, is the success postulate. In AGM revision, this stipulates that A is in K * A. By analogy with the success postulate, for programs P and Q, this means that the answer sets of Q will in some sense be contained in those of P * Q. The essential idea is that for P * Q, a three-valued answer set for Q, consisting of positive and negative literals, is first determined. The positive literals constitute a regular answer set, while the negated literals make up a minimal set of naf literals required to produce the answer set from Q. These literals are propagated to the program P, along with those rules of Q that are not decided by these literals. The approach differs from work in update logic programs in two main respects. First, we ensure that the revising logic program has higher priority, and so we satisfy the success postulate; second, for the preference implicit in a revision P * Q, the program Q as a whole takes precedence over P, unlike update logic programs, since answer sets of Q are propagated to P. We show that a core group of the AGM postulates are satisfied, as are the postulates that have been proposed for update logic programs.
cs.AI:We study the problem of coalitional manipulation in elections using the unweighted Borda rule. We provide empirical evidence of the manipulability of Borda elections in the form of two new greedy manipulation algorithms based on intuitions from the bin-packing and multiprocessor scheduling domains. Although we have not been able to show that these algorithms beat existing methods in the worst-case, our empirical evaluation shows that they significantly outperform the existing method and are able to find optimal manipulations in the vast majority of the randomly generated elections that we tested. These empirical results provide further evidence that the Borda rule provides little defense against coalitional manipulation.
cs.AI:Autonomous planetary vehicles, also known as rovers, are small autonomous vehicles equipped with a variety of sensors used to perform exploration and experiments on a planet's surface. Rovers work in a partially unknown environment, with narrow energy/time/movement constraints and, typically, small computational resources that limit the complexity of on-line planning and scheduling, thus they represent a great challenge in the field of autonomous vehicles. Indeed, formal models for such vehicles usually involve hybrid systems with nonlinear dynamics, which are difficult to handle by most of the current planning algorithms and tools. Therefore, when offline planning of the vehicle activities is required, for example for rovers that operate without a continuous Earth supervision, such planning is often performed on simplified models that are not completely realistic. In this paper we show how the UPMurphi model checking based planning tool can be used to generate resource-optimal plans to control the engine of an autonomous planetary vehicle, working directly on its hybrid model and taking into account several safety constraints, thus achieving very accurate results.
cs.AI:This paper presents the solution about the threat of a VBIED (Vehicle-Born Improvised Explosive Device) obtained with the DSmT (Dezert-Smarandache Theory). This problem has been proposed recently to the authors by Simon Maskell and John Lavery as a typical illustrative example to try to compare the different approaches for dealing with uncertainty for decision-making support. The purpose of this paper is to show in details how a solid justified solution can be obtained from DSmT approach and its fusion rules thanks to a proper modeling of the belief functions involved in this problem.
cs.AI:A key factor that can dramatically reduce the search space during constraint solving is the criterion under which the variable to be instantiated next is selected. For this purpose numerous heuristics have been proposed. Some of the best of such heuristics exploit information about failures gathered throughout search and recorded in the form of constraint weights, while others measure the importance of variable assignments in reducing the search space. In this work we experimentally evaluate the most recent and powerful variable ordering heuristics, and new variants of them, over a wide range of benchmarks. Results demonstrate that heuristics based on failures are in general more efficient. Based on this, we then derive new revision ordering heuristics that exploit recorded failures to efficiently order the propagation list when arc consistency is maintained during search. Interestingly, in addition to reducing the number of constraint checks and list operations, these heuristics are also able to cut down the size of the explored search tree.
cs.AI:The two standard branching schemes for CSPs are d-way and 2-way branching. Although it has been shown that in theory the latter can be exponentially more effective than the former, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing such differences. To investigate this, we initially make an experimental comparison of the two branching schemes over a wide range of benchmarks. Experimental results verify the theoretical gap between d-way and 2-way branching as we move from a simple variable ordering heuristic like dom to more sophisticated ones like dom/ddeg. However, perhaps surprisingly, experiments also show that when state-of-the-art variable ordering heuristics like dom/wdeg are used then d-way can be clearly more efficient than 2-way branching in many cases. Motivated by this observation, we develop two generic heuristics that can be applied at certain points during search to decide whether 2-way branching or a restricted version of 2-way branching, which is close to d-way branching, will be followed. The application of these heuristics results in an adaptive branching scheme. Experiments with instantiations of the two generic heuristics confirm that search with adaptive branching outperforms search with a fixed branching scheme on a wide range of problems.
cs.AI:Event-driven automation of reactive functionalities for complex event processing is an urgent need in today's distributed service-oriented architectures and Web-based event-driven environments. An important problem to be addressed is how to correctly and efficiently capture and process the event-based behavioral, reactive logic embodied in reaction rules, and combining this with other conditional decision logic embodied, e.g., in derivation rules. This paper elaborates a homogeneous integration approach that combines derivation rules, reaction rules and other rule types such as integrity constraints into the general framework of logic programming, the industrial-strength version of declarative programming. We describe syntax and semantics of the language, implement a distributed web-based middleware using enterprise service technologies and illustrate its adequacy in terms of expressiveness, efficiency and scalability through examples extracted from industrial use cases. The developed reaction rule language provides expressive features such as modular ID-based updates with support for external imports and self-updates of the intensional and extensional knowledge bases, transactions including integrity testing and roll-backs of update transition paths. It also supports distributed complex event processing, event messaging and event querying via efficient and scalable enterprise middleware technologies and event/action reasoning based on an event/action algebra implemented by an interval-based event calculus variant as a logic inference formalism.
cs.AI:The four intensive problems to the software rose by the software industry .i.e., User System Communication / Human Machine Interface, Meta Data extraction, Information processing & management and Data representation are discussed in this research paper. To contribute in the field we have proposed and described an intelligent semantic oriented agent based search engine including the concepts of intelligent graphical user interface, natural language based information processing, data management and data reconstruction for the final user end information representation.
cs.AI:Web development is a challenging research area for its creativity and complexity. The existing raised key challenge in web technology technologic development is the presentation of data in machine read and process able format to take advantage in knowledge based information extraction and maintenance. Currently it is not possible to search and extract optimized results using full text queries because there is no such mechanism exists which can fully extract the semantic from full text queries and then look for particular knowledge based information.
cs.AI:In order to study the communication between information systems, Gong and Xiao [Z. Gong and Z. Xiao, Communicating between information systems based on including degrees, International Journal of General Systems 39 (2010) 189--206] proposed the concept of general relation mappings based on including degrees. Some properties and the extension for fuzzy information systems of the general relation mappings have been investigated there. In this paper, we point out by counterexamples that several assertions (Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2, Theorem 4.1, and Theorem 4.3) in the aforementioned work are not true in general.
cs.AI:World Wide Web (WWW) is the most popular global information sharing and communication system consisting of three standards .i.e., Uniform Resource Identifier (URL), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML). Information is provided in text, image, audio and video formats over the web by using HTML which is considered to be unconventional in defining and formalizing the meaning of the context...
cs.AI:Recent research has highlighted the practical benefits of subjective interestingness measures, which quantify the novelty or unexpectedness of a pattern when contrasted with any prior information of the data miner (Silberschatz and Tuzhilin, 1995; Geng and Hamilton, 2006). A key challenge here is the formalization of this prior information in a way that lends itself to the definition of an interestingness subjective measure that is both meaningful and practical.   In this paper, we outline a general strategy of how this could be achieved, before working out the details for a use case that is important in its own right.   Our general strategy is based on considering prior information as constraints on a probabilistic model representing the uncertainty about the data. More specifically, we represent the prior information by the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution subject to these constraints. We briefly outline various measures that could subsequently be used to contrast patterns with this MaxEnt model, thus quantifying their subjective interestingness.
cs.AI:We examine the practicality for a user of using Answer Set Programming (ASP) for representing logical formalisms. Our example is a formalism aiming at capturing causal explanations from causal information. We show the naturalness and relative efficiency of this translation job. We are interested in the ease for writing an ASP program. Limitations of the earlier systems made that in practice, the ``declarative aspect'' was more theoretical than practical. We show how recent improvements in working ASP systems facilitate the translation.
cs.AI:Knowledge Management is a global process in companies. It includes all the processes that allow capitalization, sharing and evolution of the Knowledge Capital of the firm, generally recognized as a critical resource of the organization. Several approaches have been defined to capitalize knowledge but few of them study how to learn from this knowledge. We present in this paper an approach that helps to enhance learning from profession knowledge in an organisation. We apply our approach on knitting industry.
cs.AI:Constraint solvers are complex pieces of software which require many design decisions to be made by the implementer based on limited information. These decisions affect the performance of the finished solver significantly. Once a design decision has been made, it cannot easily be reversed, although a different decision may be more appropriate for a particular problem.   We investigate using machine learning to make these decisions automatically depending on the problem to solve. We use the alldifferent constraint as a case study. Our system is capable of making non-trivial, multi-level decisions that improve over always making a default choice and can be implemented as part of a general-purpose constraint solver.
cs.AI:Constraint problems can be trivially solved in parallel by exploring different branches of the search tree concurrently. Previous approaches have focused on implementing this functionality in the solver, more or less transparently to the user. We propose a new approach, which modifies the constraint model of the problem. An existing model is split into new models with added constraints that partition the search space. Optionally, additional constraints are imposed that rule out the search already done. The advantages of our approach are that it can be implemented easily, computations can be stopped and restarted, moved to different machines and indeed solved on machines which are not able to communicate with each other at all.
cs.AI:In many applications involving multi-media data, the definition of similarity between items is integral to several key tasks, e.g., nearest-neighbor retrieval, classification, and recommendation. Data in such regimes typically exhibits multiple modalities, such as acoustic and visual content of video. Integrating such heterogeneous data to form a holistic similarity space is therefore a key challenge to be overcome in many real-world applications.   We present a novel multiple kernel learning technique for integrating heterogeneous data into a single, unified similarity space. Our algorithm learns an optimal ensemble of kernel transfor- mations which conform to measurements of human perceptual similarity, as expressed by relative comparisons. To cope with the ubiquitous problems of subjectivity and inconsistency in multi- media similarity, we develop graph-based techniques to filter similarity measurements, resulting in a simplified and robust training procedure.
cs.AI:Consideration of the primal and dual problems together leads to important new insights into the characteristics of boosting algorithms. In this work, we propose a general framework that can be used to design new boosting algorithms. A wide variety of machine learning problems essentially minimize a regularized risk functional. We show that the proposed boosting framework, termed CGBoost, can accommodate various loss functions and different regularizers in a totally-corrective optimization fashion. We show that, by solving the primal rather than the dual, a large body of totally-corrective boosting algorithms can actually be efficiently solved and no sophisticated convex optimization solvers are needed. We also demonstrate that some boosting algorithms like AdaBoost can be interpreted in our framework--even their optimization is not totally corrective. We empirically show that various boosting algorithms based on the proposed framework perform similarly on the UCIrvine machine learning datasets [1] that we have used in the experiments.
cs.AI:Max Restricted Path Consistency (maxRPC) is a local consistency for binary constraints that can achieve considerably stronger pruning than arc consistency. However, existing maxRRC algorithms suffer from overheads and redundancies as they can repeatedly perform many constraint checks without triggering any value deletions. In this paper we propose techniques that can boost the performance of maxRPC algorithms. These include the combined use of two data structures to avoid many redundant constraint checks, and heuristics for the efficient ordering and execution of certain operations. Based on these, we propose two closely related algorithms. The first one which is a maxRPC algorithm with optimal O(end^3) time complexity, displays good performance when used stand-alone, but is expensive to apply during search. The second one approximates maxRPC and has O(en^2d^4) time complexity, but a restricted version with O(end^4) complexity can be very efficient when used during search. Both algorithms have O(ed) space complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the resulting methods constantly outperform previous algorithms for maxRPC, often by large margins, and constitute a more than viable alternative to arc consistency on many problems.
cs.AI:The technical report presents a generic exact solution approach for minimizing the project duration of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with generalized precedences (Rcpsp/max). The approach uses lazy clause generation, i.e., a hybrid of finite domain and Boolean satisfiability solving, in order to apply nogood learning and conflict-driven search on the solution generation. Our experiments show the benefit of lazy clause generation for finding an optimal solutions and proving its optimality in comparison to other state-of-the-art exact and non-exact methods. The method is highly robust: it matched or bettered the best known results on all of the 2340 instances we examined except 3, according to the currently available data on the PSPLib. Of the 631 open instances in this set it closed 573 and improved the bounds of 51 of the remaining 58 instances.
cs.AI:The search strategy of a CP solver is determined by the variable and value ordering heuristics it employs and by the branching scheme it follows. Although the effects of variable and value ordering heuristics on search effort have been widely studied, the effects of different branching schemes have received less attention. In this paper we study this effect through an experimental evaluation that includes standard branching schemes such as 2-way, d-way, and dichotomic domain splitting, as well as variations of set branching where branching is performed on sets of values. We also propose and evaluate a generic approach to set branching where the partition of a domain into sets is created using the scores assigned to values by a value ordering heuristic, and a clustering algorithm from machine learning. Experimental results demonstrate that although exponential differences between branching schemes, as predicted in theory between 2-way and d-way branching, are not very common, still the choice of branching scheme can make quite a difference on certain classes of problems. Set branching methods are very competitive with 2-way branching and outperform it on some problem classes. A statistical analysis of the results reveals that our generic clustering-based set branching method is the best among the methods compared.
cs.AI:In this paper, we address the problem of creating believable agents (virtual characters) in video games. We consider only one meaning of believability, ``giving the feeling of being controlled by a player'', and outline the problem of its evaluation. We present several models for agents in games which can produce believable behaviours, both from industry and research. For high level of believability, learning and especially imitation learning seems to be the way to go. We make a quick overview of different approaches to make video games' agents learn from players. To conclude we propose a two-step method to develop new models for believable agents. First we must find the criteria for believability for our application and define an evaluation method. Then the model and the learning algorithm can be designed.
cs.AI:Classic evaluation methods of believable agents are time-consuming because they involve many human to judge agents. They are well suited to validate work on new believable behaviours models. However, during the implementation, numerous experiments can help to improve agents' believability. We propose a method which aim at assessing how much an agent's behaviour looks like humans' behaviours. By representing behaviours with vectors, we can store data computed for humans and then evaluate as many agents as needed without further need of humans. We present a test experiment which shows that even a simple evaluation following our method can reveal differences between quite believable agents and humans. This method seems promising although, as shown in our experiment, results' analysis can be difficult.
cs.AI:In this short paper I briefly discuss 3D war Game based on artificial intelligence concepts called AI WAR. Going in to the details, I present the importance of CAICL language and how this language is used in AI WAR. Moreover I also present a designed and implemented 3D War Cybug for AI WAR using CAICL and discus the implemented strategy to defeat its enemies during the game life.
cs.AI:Levesque introduced the notion of only-knowing to precisely capture the beliefs of a knowledge base. He also showed how only-knowing can be used to formalize non-monotonic behavior within a monotonic logic. Despite its appeal, all attempts to extend only-knowing to the many agent case have undesirable properties. A belief model by Halpern and Lakemeyer, for instance, appeals to proof-theoretic constructs in the semantics and needs to axiomatize validity as part of the logic. It is also not clear how to generalize their ideas to a first-order case. In this paper, we propose a new account of multi-agent only-knowing which, for the first time, has a natural possible-world semantics for a quantified language with equality. We then provide, for the propositional fragment, a sound and complete axiomatization that faithfully lifts Levesque's proof theory to the many agent case. We also discuss comparisons to the earlier approach by Halpern and Lakemeyer.
cs.AI:In this paper we present an optimal Bangla Keyboard Layout, which distributes the load equally on both hands so that maximizing the ease and minimizing the effort. Bangla alphabet has a large number of letters, for this it is difficult to type faster using Bangla keyboard. Our proposed keyboard will maximize the speed of operator as they can type with both hands parallel. Here we use the association rule of data mining to distribute the Bangla characters in the keyboard. First, we analyze the frequencies of data consisting of monograph, digraph and trigraph, which are derived from data wire-house, and then used association rule of data mining to distribute the Bangla characters in the layout. Finally, we propose a Bangla Keyboard Layout. Experimental results on several keyboard layout shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach with better performance.

cs.AI:Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are popular tools for data mining tasks such as classification, regression, and density estimation. However, original SVM (C-SVM) only considers local information of data points on or over the margin. Therefore, C-SVM loses robustness. To solve this problem, one approach is to translate (i.e., to move without rotation or change of shape) the hyperplane according to the distribution of the entire data. But existing work can only be applied for 1-D case. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method called General Scaled SVM (GS-SVM) to extend the existing approach to multi-dimensional case. Our method translates the hyperplane according to the distribution of data projected on the normal vector of the hyperplane. Compared with C-SVM, GS-SVM has better performance on several data sets.
cs.AI:The problem of measuring similarity of graphs and their nodes is important in a range of practical problems. There is a number of proposed measures, some of them being based on iterative calculation of similarity between two graphs and the principle that two nodes are as similar as their neighbors are. In our work, we propose one novel method of that sort, with a refined concept of similarity of two nodes that involves matching of their neighbors. We prove convergence of the proposed method and show that it has some additional desirable properties that, to our knowledge, the existing methods lack. We illustrate the method on two specific problems and empirically compare it to other methods.
cs.AI:The paper proposes artificial intelligence technique called hill climbing to find numerical solutions of Diophantine Equations. Such equations are important as they have many applications in fields like public key cryptography, integer factorization, algebraic curves, projective curves and data dependency in super computers. Importantly, it has been proved that there is no general method to find solutions of such equations. This paper is an attempt to find numerical solutions of Diophantine equations using steepest ascent version of Hill Climbing. The method, which uses tree representation to depict possible solutions of Diophantine equations, adopts a novel methodology to generate successors. The heuristic function used help to make the process of finding solution as a minimization process. The work illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology using a class of Diophantine equations given by a1. x1 p1 + a2. x2 p2 + ...... + an . xn pn = N where ai and N are integers. The experimental results validate that the procedure proposed is successful in finding solutions of Diophantine Equations with sufficiently large powers and large number of variables.
cs.AI:This paper is mainly concerned with the question of how to decompose multiclass classification problems into binary subproblems. We extend known Jensen-Shannon bounds on the Bayes risk of binary problems to hierarchical multiclass problems and use these bounds to develop a heuristic procedure for constructing hierarchical multiclass decomposition for multinomials. We test our method and compare it to the well known "all-pairs" decomposition. Our tests are performed using a new authorship determination benchmark test of machine learning authors. The new method consistently outperforms the all-pairs decomposition when the number of classes is small and breaks even on larger multiclass problems. Using both methods, the classification accuracy we achieve, using an SVM over a feature set consisting of both high frequency single tokens and high frequency token-pairs, appears to be exceptionally high compared to known results in authorship determination.
cs.AI:The iDian (previously named as the Operation Agent System) is a framework designed to enable computer users to operate software in natural language. Distinct from current speech-recognition systems, our solution supports format-free combinations of orders, and is open to both developers and customers. We used a multi-layer structure to build the entire framework, approached rule-based natural language processing, and implemented demos narrowing down to Windows, text-editing and a few other applications. This essay will firstly give an overview of the entire system, and then scrutinize the functions and structure of the system, and finally discuss the prospective de-velopment, esp. on-line interaction functions.
cs.AI:In this work we present a protocol for self-synchronized duty-cycling in wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting capabilities. The protocol is implemented in Wiselib, a library of generic algorithms for sensor networks. Simulations are conducted with the sensor network simulator Shawn. They are based on the specifications of real hardware known as iSense sensor nodes. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism is able to adapt to changing energy availabilities. Moreover, it is shown that the system is very robust against packet loss.
cs.AI:Active Learning Method (ALM) is a soft computing method used for modeling and control based on fuzzy logic. All operators defined for fuzzy sets must serve as either fuzzy S-norm or fuzzy T-norm. Despite being a powerful modeling method, ALM does not possess operators which serve as S-norms and T-norms which deprive it of a profound analytical expression/form. This paper introduces two new operators based on morphology which satisfy the following conditions: First, they serve as fuzzy S-norm and T-norm. Second, they satisfy Demorgans law, so they complement each other perfectly. These operators are investigated via three viewpoints: Mathematics, Geometry and fuzzy logic.
cs.AI:Substitutability, interchangeability and related concepts in Constraint Programming were introduced approximately twenty years ago and have given rise to considerable subsequent research. We survey this work, classify, and relate the different concepts, and indicate directions for future work, in particular with respect to making connections with research into symmetry breaking. This paper is a condensed version of a larger work in progress.
cs.AI:Concept drift refers to a non stationary learning problem over time. The training and the application data often mismatch in real life problems. In this report we present a context of concept drift problem 1. We focus on the issues relevant to adaptive training set formation. We present the framework and terminology, and formulate a global picture of concept drift learners design. We start with formalizing the framework for the concept drifting data in Section 1. In Section 2 we discuss the adaptivity mechanisms of the concept drift learners. In Section 3 we overview the principle mechanisms of concept drift learners. In this chapter we give a general picture of the available algorithms and categorize them based on their properties. Section 5 discusses the related research fields and Section 5 groups and presents major concept drift applications. This report is intended to give a bird's view of concept drift research field, provide a context of the research and position it within broad spectrum of research fields and applications.
cs.AI:We introduce a new perspective on spectral dimensionality reduction which views these methods as Gaussian Markov random fields (GRFs). Our unifying perspective is based on the maximum entropy principle which is in turn inspired by maximum variance unfolding. The resulting model, which we call maximum entropy unfolding (MEU) is a nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis. We relate the model to Laplacian eigenmaps and isomap. We show that parameter fitting in the locally linear embedding (LLE) is approximate maximum likelihood MEU. We introduce a variant of LLE that performs maximum likelihood exactly: Acyclic LLE (ALLE). We show that MEU and ALLE are competitive with the leading spectral approaches on a robot navigation visualization and a human motion capture data set. Finally the maximum likelihood perspective allows us to introduce a new approach to dimensionality reduction based on L1 regularization of the Gaussian random field via the graphical lasso.
cs.AI:Human can be distinguished by different limb movements and unique ground reaction force. Cumulative foot pressure image is a 2-D cumulative ground reaction force during one gait cycle. Although it contains pressure spatial distribution information and pressure temporal distribution information, it suffers from several problems including different shoes and noise, when putting it into practice as a new biometric for pedestrian identification. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical translation-invariant representation for cumulative foot pressure images, inspired by the success of Convolutional deep belief network for digital classification. Key contribution in our approach is discriminative hierarchical sparse coding scheme which helps to learn useful discriminative high-level visual features. Based on the feature representation of cumulative foot pressure images, we develop a pedestrian recognition system which is invariant to three different shoes and slight local shape change. Experiments are conducted on a proposed open dataset that contains more than 2800 cumulative foot pressure images from 118 subjects. Evaluations suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method and the potential of cumulative foot pressure images as a biometric.
cs.AI:An important issue in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning is the representation of relative direction. In this paper we present simple geometric rules that enable reasoning about relative direction between oriented points. This framework, the Oriented Point Algebra OPRA_m, has a scalable granularity m. We develop a simple algorithm for computing the OPRA_m composition tables and prove its correctness. Using a composition table, algebraic closure for a set of OPRA statements is sufficient to solve spatial navigation tasks. And it turns out that scalable granularity is useful in these navigation tasks.
cs.AI:In the article a turn-based game played on four computers connected via network is investigated. There are three computers with natural intelligence and one with artificial intelligence. Game table is seen by each player's own view point in all players' monitors. Domino pieces are three dimensional. For distributed systems TCP/IP protocol is used. In order to get 3D image, Microsoft XNA technology is applied. Domino 101 game is nondeterministic game that is result of the game depends on the initial random distribution of the pieces. Number of the distributions is equal to the multiplication of following combinations: . Moreover, in this game that is played by four people, players are divided into 2 pairs. Accordingly, we cannot predict how the player uses the dominoes that is according to the dominoes of his/her partner or according to his/her own dominoes. The fact that the natural intelligence can be a player in any level affects the outcome. These reasons make it difficult to develop an AI. In the article four levels of AI are developed. The AI in the first level is equivalent to the intelligence of a child who knows the rules of the game and recognizes the numbers. The AI in this level plays if it has any domino, suitable to play or says pass. In most of the games which can be played on the internet, the AI does the same. But the AI in the last level is a master player, and it can develop itself according to its competitors' levels.
cs.AI:In this paper it is considered rule reduct generation problem, based on Rough Set Theory. Rule Reduct Generation (RG) and Modified Rule Generation (MRG) algorithms are well-known. Alternative to these algorithms Pruning Algorithm of Generation A Minimal Set of Rule Reducts, or briefly Pruning Rule Generation (PRG) algorithm is developed. PRG algorithm uses tree structured data type. PRG algorithm is compared with RG and MRG algorithms
cs.AI:The cardinal direction calculus (CDC) proposed by Goyal and Egenhofer is a very expressive qualitative calculus for directional information of extended objects. Early work has shown that consistency checking of complete networks of basic CDC constraints is tractable while reasoning with the CDC in general is NP-hard. This paper shows, however, if allowing some constraints unspecified, then consistency checking of possibly incomplete networks of basic CDC constraints is already intractable. This draws a sharp boundary between the tractable and intractable subclasses of the CDC. The result is achieved by a reduction from the well-known 3-SAT problem.
cs.AI:Imitation learning in robots, also called programing by demonstration, has made important advances in recent years, allowing humans to teach context dependant motor skills/tasks to robots. We propose to extend the usual contexts investigated to also include acoustic linguistic expressions that might denote a given motor skill, and thus we target joint learning of the motor skills and their potential acoustic linguistic name. In addition to this, a modification of a class of existing algorithms within the imitation learning framework is made so that they can handle the unlabeled demonstration of several tasks/motor primitives without having to inform the imitator of what task is being demonstrated or what the number of tasks are, which is a necessity for language learning, i.e; if one wants to teach naturally an open number of new motor skills together with their acoustic names. Finally, a mechanism for detecting whether or not linguistic input is relevant to the task is also proposed, and our architecture also allows the robot to find the right framing for a given identified motor primitive. With these additions it becomes possible to build an imitator that bridges the gap between imitation learning and language learning by being able to learn linguistic expressions using methods from the imitation learning community. In this sense the imitator can learn a word by guessing whether a certain speech pattern present in the context means that a specific task is to be executed. The imitator is however not assumed to know that speech is relevant and has to figure this out on its own by looking at the demonstrations: indeed, the architecture allows the robot to transparently also learn tasks which should not be triggered by an acoustic word, but for example by the color or position of an object or a gesture made by someone in the environment. To demonstrate this ability to find the ...
cs.AI:The aim of this study is to show the importance of two classification techniques, viz. decision tree and clustering, in prediction of learning disabilities (LD) of school-age children. LDs affect about 10 percent of all children enrolled in schools. The problems of children with specific learning disabilities have been a cause of concern to parents and teachers for some time. Decision trees and clustering are powerful and popular tools used for classification and prediction in Data mining. Different rules extracted from the decision tree are used for prediction of learning disabilities. Clustering is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets, called clusters, which are useful in finding the different signs and symptoms (attributes) present in the LD affected child. In this paper, J48 algorithm is used for constructing the decision tree and K-means algorithm is used for creating the clusters. By applying these classification techniques, LD in any child can be identified.
cs.AI:The task of verifying the compatibility between interacting web services has traditionally been limited to checking the compatibility of the interaction protocol in terms of message sequences and the type of data being exchanged. Since web services are developed largely in an uncoordinated way, different services often use independently developed ontologies for the same domain instead of adhering to a single ontology as standard. In this work we investigate the approaches that can be taken by the server to verify the possibility to reach a state with semantically inconsistent results during the execution of a protocol with a client, if the client ontology is published. Often database is used to store the actual data along with the ontologies instead of storing the actual data as a part of the ontology description. It is important to observe that at the current state of the database the semantic conflict state may not be reached even if the verification done by the server indicates the possibility of reaching a conflict state. A relational algebra based decision procedure is also developed to incorporate the current state of the client and the server databases in the overall verification procedure.
cs.AI:The paper proposes a numerically stable recursive algorithm for the exact computation of the linear-chain conditional random field gradient. It operates as a forward algorithm over the log-domain expectation semiring and has the purpose of enhancing memory efficiency when applied to long observation sequences. Unlike the traditional algorithm based on the forward-backward recursions, the memory complexity of our algorithm does not depend on the sequence length. The experiments on real data show that it can be useful for the problems which deal with long sequences.
cs.AI:In this paper, a new reinforcement learning approach is proposed which is based on a powerful concept named Active Learning Method (ALM) in modeling. ALM expresses any multi-input-single-output system as a fuzzy combination of some single-input-singleoutput systems. The proposed method is an actor-critic system similar to Generalized Approximate Reasoning based Intelligent Control (GARIC) structure to adapt the ALM by delayed reinforcement signals. Our system uses Temporal Difference (TD) learning to model the behavior of useful actions of a control system. The goodness of an action is modeled on Reward- Penalty-Plane. IDS planes will be updated according to this plane. It is shown that the system can learn with a predefined fuzzy system or without it (through random actions).
cs.AI:An effective approach for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks is scheduling sleep intervals for extraneous nodes while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous service. For the sensor network to operate successfully the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity, It proved before if the communication range of nodes is at least twice the sensing range, complete coverage of a convex area implies connectivity among the working set of nodes. In this paper we consider a rectangular region A = a *b, such that R a R b s s {\pounds}, {\pounds}, where s R is the sensing range of nodes. and put a constraint on minimum allowed distance between nodes(s). according to this constraint we present a new lower bound for communication range relative to sensing range of sensors(s 2 + 3 *R) that complete coverage of considered area implies connectivity among the working set of nodes; also we present a new distribution method, that satisfy our constraint.
cs.AI:In this paper, we propose a new approach for recommender systems based on target tracking by Kalman filtering. We assume that users and their seen resources are vectors in the multidimensional space of the categories of the resources. Knowing this space, we propose an algorithm based on a Kalman filter to track users and to predict the best prediction of their future position in the recommendation space.
cs.AI:We investigate projection methods, for evaluating a linear approximation of the value function of a policy in a Markov Decision Process context. We consider two popular approaches, the one-step Temporal Difference fix-point computation (TD(0)) and the Bellman Residual (BR) minimization. We describe examples, where each method outperforms the other. We highlight a simple relation between the objective function they minimize, and show that while BR enjoys a performance guarantee, TD(0) does not in general. We then propose a unified view in terms of oblique projections of the Bellman equation, which substantially simplifies and extends the characterization of (schoknecht,2002) and the recent analysis of (Yu & Bertsekas, 2008). Eventually, we describe some simulations that suggest that if the TD(0) solution is usually slightly better than the BR solution, its inherent numerical instability makes it very bad in some cases, and thus worse on average.
cs.AI:Graph coloring, also known as vertex coloring, considers the problem of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that adjacent nodes do not share the same color. The optimization version of the problem concerns the minimization of the number of used colors. In this paper we deal with the problem of finding valid colorings of graphs in a distributed way, that is, by means of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color of the nodes. Such algorithms prescind from any central control. Due to the fact that quite a few practical applications require to find colorings in a distributed way, the interest in distributed algorithms for graph coloring has been growing during the last decade. As an example consider wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks, where tasks such as the assignment of frequencies or the assignment of TDMA slots are strongly related to graph coloring.   The algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by the calling behavior of Japanese tree frogs. Male frogs use their calls to attract females. Interestingly, groups of males that are located nearby each other desynchronize their calls. This is because female frogs are only able to correctly localize the male frogs when their calls are not too close in time. We experimentally show that our algorithm is very competitive with the current state of the art, using different sets of problem instances and comparing to one of the most competitive algorithms from the literature.
cs.AI:This paper describes an application of Bayesian programming to the control of an autonomous avatar in a multiplayer role-playing game (the example is based on World of Warcraft). We model a particular task, which consists of choosing what to do and to select which target in a situation where allies and foes are present. We explain the model in Bayesian programming and show how we could learn the conditional probabilities from data gathered during human-played sessions.
cs.AI:We present a probabilistic logic programming framework to reinforcement learning, by integrating reinforce-ment learning, in POMDP environments, with normal hybrid probabilistic logic programs with probabilistic answer set seman-tics, that is capable of representing domain-specific knowledge. We formally prove the correctness of our approach. We show that the complexity of finding a policy for a reinforcement learning problem in our approach is NP-complete. In addition, we show that any reinforcement learning problem can be encoded as a classical logic program with answer set semantics. We also show that a reinforcement learning problem can be encoded as a SAT problem. We present a new high level action description language that allows the factored representation of POMDP. Moreover, we modify the original model of POMDP so that it be able to distinguish between knowledge producing actions and actions that change the environment.
cs.AI:Biometrics is the science and technology of measuring and analyzing biological data of human body, extracting a feature set from the acquired data, and comparing this set against to the template set in the database. Experimental studies show that Unimodal biometric systems had many disadvantages regarding performance and accuracy. Multimodal biometric systems perform better than unimodal biometric systems and are popular even more complex also. We examine the accuracy and performance of multimodal biometric authentication systems using state of the art Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) products. Here we discuss fingerprint and face biometric systems, decision and fusion techniques used in these systems. We also discuss their advantage over unimodal biometric systems.
cs.AI:Uncertainty of decisions in safety-critical engineering applications can be estimated on the basis of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of averaging over decision models. The use of decision tree (DT) models assists experts to interpret causal relations and find factors of the uncertainty. Bayesian averaging also allows experts to estimate the uncertainty accurately when a priori information on the favored structure of DTs is available. Then an expert can select a single DT model, typically the Maximum a Posteriori model, for interpretation purposes. Unfortunately, a priori information on favored structure of DTs is not always available. For this reason, we suggest a new prior on DTs for the Bayesian MCMC technique. We also suggest a new procedure of selecting a single DT and describe an application scenario. In our experiments on the Short-Term Conflict Alert data our technique outperforms the existing Bayesian techniques in predictive accuracy of the selected single DTs.
cs.AI:We examine the practicality for a user of using Answer Set Programming (ASP) for representing logical formalisms. We choose as an example a formalism aiming at capturing causal explanations from causal information. We provide an implementation, showing the naturalness and relative efficiency of this translation job. We are interested in the ease for writing an ASP program, in accordance with the claimed ``declarative'' aspect of ASP. Limitations of the earlier systems (poor data structure and difficulty in reusing pieces of programs) made that in practice, the ``declarative aspect'' was more theoretical than practical. We show how recent improvements in working ASP systems facilitate a lot the translation, even if a few improvements could still be useful.
cs.AI:There are a huge number of problems, from various areas, being solved by reducing them to SAT. However, for many applications, translation into SAT is performed by specialized, problem-specific tools. In this paper we describe a new system for uniform solving of a wide class of problems by reducing them to SAT. The system uses a new specification language URSA that combines imperative and declarative programming paradigms. The reduction to SAT is defined precisely by the semantics of the specification language. The domain of the approach is wide (e.g., many NP-complete problems can be simply specified and then solved by the system) and there are problems easily solvable by the proposed system, while they can be hardly solved by using other programming languages or constraint programming systems. So, the system can be seen not only as a tool for solving problems by reducing them to SAT, but also as a general-purpose constraint solving system (for finite domains). In this paper, we also describe an open-source implementation of the described approach. The performed experiments suggest that the system is competitive to state-of-the-art related modelling systems.
cs.AI:SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is one of the most widespread ontologies in the life sciences, with more than 300,000 concepts and relationships, but is distributed with no associated software tools. In this paper we present MySNOM, a web-based SNOMED CT browser. MySNOM allows organizations to browse their own distribution of SNOMED CT under a controlled environment, focuses on navigating using the structure of SNOMED CT, and has diagramming capabilities.
cs.AI:In this paper we dealt with the comparison and linking between lexical resources with domain knowledge provided by ontologies. It is one of the issues for the combination of the Semantic Web Ontologies and Text Mining. We investigated the relations between the linguistics oriented and domain-specific semantics, by associating the GO biological process concepts to the FrameNet semantic frames. The result shows the gaps between the linguistics-oriented and domain-specific semantics on the classification of events and the grouping of target words. The result provides valuable information for the improvement of domain ontologies supporting for text mining systems. And also, it will result in benefits to language understanding technology.
cs.AI:Virtual e-Science infrastructures supporting Web-based scientific workflows are an example for knowledge-intensive collaborative and weakly-structured processes where the interaction with the human scientists during process execution plays a central role. In this paper we propose the lightweight dynamic user-friendly interaction with humans during execution of scientific workflows via the low-barrier approach of Semantic Wikis as an intuitive interface for non-technical scientists. Our Process Makna Semantic Wiki system is a novel combination of an business process management system adapted for scientific workflows with a Corporate Semantic Web Wiki user interface supporting knowledge intensive human interaction tasks during scientific workflow execution.
cs.AI:ChemgaPedia is a multimedia, webbased eLearning service platform that currently contains about 18.000 pages organized in 1.700 chapters covering the complete bachelor studies in chemistry and related topics of chemistry, pharmacy, and life sciences. The eLearning encyclopedia contains some 25.000 media objects and the eLearning platform provides services such as virtual and remote labs for experiments. With up to 350.000 users per month the platform is the most frequently used scientific educational service in the German spoken Internet. In this demo we show the benefit of mapping the static eLearning contents of ChemgaPedia to a Linked Data representation for Semantic Chemistry which allows for generating dynamic eLearning paths tailored to the semantic profiles of the users.
cs.AI:This research applies ideas from argumentation theory in the context of semantic wikis, aiming to provide support for structured-large scale argumentation between human agents. The implemented prototype is exemplified by modelling the MMR vaccine controversy.
cs.AI:Creating a new Ontology: a Modular Approach
cs.AI:Research in the Life Sciences depends on the integration of large, distributed and heterogeneous data sources and web services. The discovery of which of these resources are the most appropriate to solve a given task is a complex research question, since there is a large amount of plausible candidates and there is little, mostly unstructured, metadata to be able to decide among them.We contribute a semi-automatic approach,based on semantic techniques, to assist researchers in the discovery of the most appropriate web services to full a set of given requirements.
cs.AI:Semantic wikis, wikis enhanced with Semantic Web technologies, are appropriate systems for community-authored knowledge models. They are particularly suitable for scientific collaboration. This paper details the design principles ofWikiBridge, a semantic wiki.
cs.AI:We present Populous, a tool for gathering content with which to populate an ontology. Domain experts need to add content, that is often repetitive in its form, but without having to tackle the underlying ontological representation. Populous presents users with a table based form in which columns are constrained to take values from particular ontologies; the user can select a concept from an ontology via its meaningful label to give a value for a given entity attribute. Populated tables are mapped to patterns that can then be used to automatically generate the ontology's content. Populous's contribution is in the knowledge gathering stage of ontology development. It separates knowledge gathering from the conceptualisation and also separates the user from the standard ontology authoring environments. As a result, Populous can allow knowledge to be gathered in a straight-forward manner that can then be used to do mass production of ontology content.
cs.AI:In this work, we develop an intelligent user interface that allows users to enter biomedical queries in a natural language, and that presents the answers (possibly with explanations if requested) in a natural language. We develop a rule layer over biomedical ontologies and databases, and use automated reasoners to answer queries considering relevant parts of the rule layer.
cs.AI:There has been a long history of using fuzzy language equivalence to compare the behavior of fuzzy systems, but the comparison at this level is too coarse. Recently, a finer behavioral measure, bisimulation, has been introduced to fuzzy finite automata. However, the results obtained are applicable only to finite-state systems. In this paper, we consider bisimulation for general fuzzy systems which may be infinite-state or infinite-event, by modeling them as fuzzy transition systems. To help understand and check bisimulation, we characterize it in three ways by enumerating whole transitions, comparing individual transitions, and using a monotonic function. In addition, we address composition operations, subsystems, quotients, and homomorphisms of fuzzy transition systems and discuss their properties connected with bisimulation. The results presented here are useful for comparing the behavior of general fuzzy systems. In particular, this makes it possible to relate an infinite fuzzy system to a finite one, which is easier to analyze, with the same behavior.
cs.AI:Fuzzy automata have long been accepted as a generalization of nondeterministic finite automata. A closer examination, however, shows that the fundamental property---nondeterminism---in nondeterministic finite automata has not been well embodied in the generalization. In this paper, we introduce nondeterministic fuzzy automata with or without $\el$-moves and fuzzy languages recognized by them. Furthermore, we prove that (deterministic) fuzzy automata, nondeterministic fuzzy automata, and nondeterministic fuzzy automata with $\el$-moves are all equivalent in the sense that they recognize the same class of fuzzy languages.
cs.AI:The previous decade has brought a remarkable increase of the interest in applications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Many of the research efforts in this context have focused on introducing new representation methods for dimensionality reduction or novel similarity measures for the underlying data. In the vast majority of cases, each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive experimental study re-implementing eight different time series representations and nine similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on thirty-eight time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. In addition to providing a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, our experiments also indicate that, in some cases, certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.
cs.AI:In this paper, we propose a new approach for recommender systems based on target tracking by Kalman filtering. We assume that users and their seen resources are vectors in the multidimensional space of the categories of the resources. Knowing this space, we propose an algorithm based on a Kalman filter to track users and to predict the best prediction of their future position in the recommendation space.
cs.AI:Knowledge is attributed to human whose problem-solving behavior is subjective and complex. In today's knowledge economy, the need to manage knowledge produced by a community of actors cannot be overemphasized. This is due to the fact that actors possess some level of tacit knowledge which is generally difficult to articulate. Problem-solving requires searching and sharing of knowledge among a group of actors in a particular context. Knowledge expressed within the context of a problem resolution must be capitalized for future reuse. In this paper, an approach that permits dynamic capitalization of relevant and reliable actors' knowledge in solving decision problem following Economic Intelligence process is proposed. Knowledge annotation method and temporal attributes are used for handling the complexity in the communication among actors and in contextualizing expressed knowledge. A prototype is built to demonstrate the functionalities of a collaborative Knowledge Management system based on this approach. It is tested with sample cases and the result showed that dynamic capitalization leads to knowledge validation hence increasing reliability of captured knowledge for reuse. The system can be adapted to various domains
cs.AI:The shift from industrial economy to knowledge economy in today's world has revolutionalized strategic planning in organizations as well as their problem solving approaches. The point of focus today is knowledge and service production with more emphasis been laid on knowledge capital. Many organizations are investing on tools that facilitate knowledge sharing among their employees and they are as well promoting and encouraging collaboration among their staff in order to build the organization's knowledge capital with the ultimate goal of creating a lasting competitive advantage for their organizations. One of the current leading approaches used for solving organization's decision problem is the Economic Intelligence (EI) approach which involves interactions among various actors called EI actors. These actors collaborate to ensure the overall success of the decision problem solving process. In the course of the collaboration, the actors express knowledge which could be capitalized for future reuse. In this paper, we propose in the first place, an annotation model for knowledge elicitation among EI actors. Because of the need to build a knowledge capital, we also propose a dynamic knowledge capitalisation approach for managing knowledge produced by the actors. Finally, the need to manage the interactions and the interdependencies among collaborating EI actors, led to our third proposition which constitute an awareness mechanism for group work management.
cs.AI:A new distance function dist(A,B) for fuzzy sets A and B is introduced. It is based on the descriptive complexity, i.e., the number of bits (on average) that are needed to describe an element in the symmetric difference of the two sets. The distance gives the amount of additional information needed to describe any one of the two sets given the other. We prove its mathematical properties and perform pattern clustering on data based on this distance.
cs.AI:Product take-back legislation forces manufacturers to bear the costs of collection and disposal of products that have reached the end of their useful lives. In order to reduce these costs, manufacturers can consider reuse, remanufacturing and/or recycling of components as an alternative to disposal. The implementation of such alternatives usually requires an appropriate reverse supply chain management. With the concepts of reverse supply chain are gaining popularity in practice, the use of artificial intelligence approaches in these areas is also becoming popular. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the recent publications concerning the application of artificial intelligence techniques to reverse supply chain with emphasis on certain types of product returns.
cs.AI:Intersections constitute one of the most dangerous elements in road systems. Traffic signals remain the most common way to control traffic at high-volume intersections and offer many opportunities to apply intelligent transportation systems to make traffic more efficient and safe. This paper describes an automated method to estimate the temporal exposure of road users crossing the conflict zone to lateral collision with road users originating from a different approach. This component is part of a larger system relying on video sensors to provide queue lengths and spatial occupancy that are used for real time traffic control and monitoring. The method is evaluated on data collected during a real world experiment.
cs.AI:A conservative class of constraint satisfaction problems CSPs is a class for which membership is preserved under arbitrary domain reductions. Many well-known tractable classes of CSPs are conservative. It is well known that lexleader constraints may significantly reduce the number of solutions by excluding symmetric solutions of CSPs. We show that adding certain lexleader constraints to any instance of any conservative class of CSPs still allows us to find all solutions with a time which is polynomial between successive solutions. The time is polynomial in the total size of the instance and the additional lexleader constraints. It is well known that for complete symmetry breaking one may need an exponential number of lexleader constraints. However, in practice, the number of additional lexleader constraints is typically polynomial number in the size of the instance. For polynomially many lexleader constraints, we may in general not have complete symmetry breaking but polynomially many lexleader constraints may provide practically useful symmetry breaking -- and they sometimes exclude super-exponentially many solutions. We prove that for any instance from a conservative class, the time between finding successive solutions of the instance with polynomially many additional lexleader constraints is polynomial even in the size of the instance without lexleaderconstraints.
cs.AI:In the interpretation of experimental data, one is actually looking for plausible explanations. We look for a measure of plausibility, with which we can compare different possible explanations, and which can be combined when there are different sets of data. This is contrasted to the conventional measure for probabilities as well as to the proposed measure of possibilities. We define what characteristics this measure of plausibility should have.   In getting to the conception of this measure, we explore the relation of plausibility to abductive reasoning, and to Bayesian probabilities. We also compare with the Dempster-Schaefer theory of evidence, which also has its own definition for plausibility. Abduction can be associated with biconditionality in inference rules, and this provides a platform to relate to the Collins-Michalski theory of plausibility. Finally, using a formalism for wiring logic onto Hopfield neural networks, we ask if this is relevant in obtaining this measure.
cs.AI:This article deals with Part family formation problem which is believed to be moderately complicated to be solved in polynomial time in the vicinity of Group Technology (GT). In the past literature researchers investigated that the part family formation techniques are principally based on production flow analysis (PFA) which usually considers operational requirements, sequences and time. Part Coding Analysis (PCA) is merely considered in GT which is believed to be the proficient method to identify the part families. PCA classifies parts by allotting them to different families based on their resemblances in: (1) design characteristics such as shape and size, and/or (2) manufacturing characteristics (machining requirements). A novel approach based on simulated annealing namely SAPFOCS is adopted in this study to develop effective part families exploiting the PCA technique. Thereafter Taguchi's orthogonal design method is employed to solve the critical issues on the subject of parameters selection for the proposed metaheuristic algorithm. The adopted technique is therefore tested on 5 different datasets of size 5 {\times} 9 to 27 {\times} 9 and the obtained results are compared with C-Linkage clustering technique. The experimental results reported that the proposed metaheuristic algorithm is extremely effective in terms of the quality of the solution obtained and has outperformed C-Linkage algorithm in most instances.
cs.AI:Using the notion of an elementary loop, Gebser and Schaub refined the theorem on loop formulas due to Lin and Zhao by considering loop formulas of elementary loops only. In this article, we reformulate their definition of an elementary loop, extend it to disjunctive programs, and study several properties of elementary loops, including how maximal elementary loops are related to minimal unfounded sets. The results provide useful insights into the stable model semantics in terms of elementary loops. For a nondisjunctive program, using a graph-theoretic characterization of an elementary loop, we show that the problem of recognizing an elementary loop is tractable. On the other hand, we show that the corresponding problem is {\sf coNP}-complete for a disjunctive program. Based on the notion of an elementary loop, we present the class of Head-Elementary-loop-Free (HEF) programs, which strictly generalizes the class of Head-Cycle-Free (HCF) programs due to Ben-Eliyahu and Dechter. Like an HCF program, an HEF program can be turned into an equivalent nondisjunctive program in polynomial time by shifting head atoms into the body.
cs.AI:In this paper we introduce a method for extending binary qualitative direction calculi with adjustable granularity like OPRAm or the star calculus with a granular distance concept. This method is similar to the concept of extending points with an internal reference direction to get oriented points which are the basic entities in the OPRAm calculus. Even if the spatial objects are from a geometrical point of view infinitesimal small points locally available reference measures are attached. In the case of OPRAm, a reference direction is attached. The same principle works also with local reference distances which are called elevations. The principle of attaching references features to a point is called hidden feature attachment.
cs.AI:In video games, virtual characters' decision systems often use a simplified representation of the world. To increase both their autonomy and believability we want those characters to be able to learn this representation from human players. We propose to use a model called growing neural gas to learn by imitation the topology of the environment. The implementation of the model, the modifications and the parameters we used are detailed. Then, the quality of the learned representations and their evolution during the learning are studied using different measures. Improvements for the growing neural gas to give more information to the character's model are given in the conclusion.
cs.AI:Current work in planning with preferences assume that the user's preference models are completely specified and aim to search for a single solution plan. In many real-world planning scenarios, however, the user probably cannot provide any information about her desired plans, or in some cases can only express partial preferences. In such situations, the planner has to present not only one but a set of plans to the user, with the hope that some of them are similar to the plan she prefers. We first propose the usage of different measures to capture quality of plan sets that are suitable for such scenarios: domain-independent distance measures defined based on plan elements (actions, states, causal links) if no knowledge of the user's preferences is given, and the Integrated Convex Preference measure in case the user's partial preference is provided. We then investigate various heuristic approaches to find set of plans according to these measures, and present empirical results demonstrating the promise of our approach.
cs.AI:Performing effective preference-based data retrieval requires detailed and preferentially meaningful structurized information about the current user as well as the items under consideration. A common problem is that representations of items often only consist of mere technical attributes, which do not resemble human perception. This is particularly true for integral items such as movies or songs. It is often claimed that meaningful item features could be extracted from collaborative rating data, which is becoming available through social networking services. However, there is only anecdotal evidence supporting this claim; but if it is true, the extracted information could very valuable for preference-based data retrieval. In this paper, we propose a methodology to systematically check this common claim. We performed a preliminary investigation on a large collection of movie ratings and present initial evidence.
cs.AI:We suggest a procedure that is relevant both to electronic performance and human psychology, so that the creative logic and the respect for human nature appear in a good agreement. The idea is to create an electronic card containing basic information about a person's psychological behavior in order to make it possible to quickly decide about the suitability of one for another. This "psychological electronics" approach could be tested via student projects.
cs.AI:Meaning negotiation (MN) is the general process with which agents reach an agreement about the meaning of a set of terms. Artificial Intelligence scholars have dealt with the problem of MN by means of argumentations schemes, beliefs merging and information fusion operators, and ontology alignment but the proposed approaches depend upon the number of participants. In this paper, we give a general model of MN for an arbitrary number of agents, in which each participant discusses with the others her viewpoint by exhibiting it in an actual set of constraints on the meaning of the negotiated terms. We call this presentation of individual viewpoints an angle. The agents do not aim at forming a common viewpoint but, instead, at agreeing about an acceptable common angle. We analyze separately the process of MN by two agents (\emph{bilateral} or \emph{pairwise} MN) and by more than two agents (\emph{multiparty} MN), and we use game theoretic models to understand how the process develops in both cases: the models are Bargaining Game for bilateral MN and English Auction for multiparty MN. We formalize the process of reaching such an agreement by giving a deduction system that comprises of rules that are consistent and adequate for representing MN.
cs.AI:Although some information-theoretic measures of uncertainty or granularity have been proposed in rough set theory, these measures are only dependent on the underlying partition and the cardinality of the universe, independent of the lower and upper approximations. It seems somewhat unreasonable since the basic idea of rough set theory aims at describing vague concepts by the lower and upper approximations. In this paper, we thus define new information-theoretic entropy and co-entropy functions associated to the partition and the approximations to measure the uncertainty and granularity of an approximation space. After introducing the novel notions of entropy and co-entropy, we then examine their properties. In particular, we discuss the relationship of co-entropies between different universes. The theoretical development is accompanied by illustrative numerical examples.
cs.AI:One of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way. The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the execution of several environments, including those which are generated randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests, the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated environment will serve that purpose.
cs.AI:The World Wide Web (WWW) allows the people to share the information (data) from the large database repositories globally. The amount of information grows billions of databases. We need to search the information will specialize tools known generically search engine. There are many of search engines available today, retrieving meaningful information is difficult. However to overcome this problem in search engines to retrieve meaningful information intelligently, semantic web technologies are playing a major role. In this paper we present survey on the search engine generations and the role of search engines in intelligent web and semantic search technologies.
cs.AI:The analysis of online least squares estimation is at the heart of many stochastic sequential decision making problems. We employ tools from the self-normalized processes to provide a simple and self-contained proof of a tail bound of a vector-valued martingale. We use the bound to construct a new tighter confidence sets for the least squares estimate.   We apply the confidence sets to several online decision problems, such as the multi-armed and the linearly parametrized bandit problems. The confidence sets are potentially applicable to other problems such as sleeping bandits, generalized linear bandits, and other linear control problems.   We improve the regret bound of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm of Auer et al. (2002) and show that its regret is with high-probability a problem dependent constant. In the case of linear bandits (Dani et al., 2008), we improve the problem dependent bound in the dimension and number of time steps. Furthermore, as opposed to the previous result, we prove that our bound holds for small sample sizes, and at the same time the worst case bound is improved by a logarithmic factor and the constant is improved.
cs.AI:This paper presents a new multi-objective hybrid model that makes cooperation between the strength of research of neighborhood methods presented by the tabu search (TS) and the important exploration capacity of evolutionary algorithm. This model was implemented and tested in benchmark functions (ZDT1, ZDT2, and ZDT3), using a network of computers.
cs.AI:An algorithm running in O(1.1995n) is presented for counting models for exact satisfiability formulae(#XSAT). This is faster than the previously best algorithm which runs in O(1.2190n). In order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, a new principle, i.e. the common literals principle, is addressed to simplify formulae. This allows us to eliminate more common literals. In addition, we firstly inject the resolution principles into solving #XSAT problem, and therefore this further improves the efficiency of the algorithm.
q-bio.BM:We consider the regime in which the bands of the torsional acoustic (TA) and the hydrogen-bond-stretch (HBS) modes of the DNA interpenetrate each other. Within the framework of a model that accommodates the structure of the double helix, we find the three-wave interaction between the TA- and the HBS-modes, and show that microwave radiation could bring about torsional vibrations that could serve as a pump mode for maintaining the HBS-one. Rayleigh's threshold condition for the parametric resonance provides an estimate for the power density of the mw-field necessary for generating the HBS-mode.
q-bio.BM:Identifying the driving forces and the mechanism of association of huntingtin-exon1, a close marker for the progress of Huntington's disease, is an important prerequisite towards finding potential drug targets, and ultimately a cure. We introduce here a modelling framework based on a key analogy of the physico-chemical properties of the exon1 fragment to block copolymers. We use a systematic mesoscale methodology, based on Dissipative Particle Dynamics, which is capable of overcoming kinetic barriers, thus capturing the dynamics of significantly larger systems over longer times than considered before. Our results reveal that the relative hydrophobicity of the poly-glutamine block as compared to the rest of the (proline-based) exon1 fragment, ignored to date, constitutes a major factor in the initiation of the self-assembly process. We find that the assembly is governed by both the concentration of exon1 and the length of the poly-glutamine stretch, with a low length threshold for association even at the lowest volume fractions we considered. Moreover, this self-association occurs irrespective of whether the glutamine stretch is in random coil or hairpin configuration, leading to spherical or cylindrical assemblies, respectively. We discuss the implications of these results for reinterpretation of existing research within this context, including that the routes towards aggregation of exon1 may be distinct to those of the widely studied homopolymeric poly-glutamine peptides.
q-bio.BM:The molecular mechanism of the solvent motion that is required to instigate the protein structural relaxation above a critical hydration level or transition temperature has yet to be determined. In this work we use quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and molecular dynamics simulation to investigate hydration water dynamics near a greatly simplified protein surface. We consider the hydration water dynamics near the completely deuterated N-acetyl-leucine-methylamide (NALMA) solute, a hydrophobic amino acid side chain attached to a polar blocked polypeptide backbone, as a function of concentration between 0.5M-2.0M, under ambient conditions. In this Communication, we focus our results of hydration dynamics near a model protein surface on the issue of how enzymatic activity is restored once a critical hydration level is reached, and provide a hypothesis for the molecular mechanism of the solvent motion that is required to trigger protein structural relaxation when above the hydration transition.
q-bio.BM:We analyze the dependence of thermal denaturation transition and folding rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid residues, N. Using lattice Go models we show that DeltaT/T_F ~ N^-1, where T_F is the folding transition temperature and DeltaT is the folding transition width. This finding is consistent with finite size effects expected for the systems undergoing a phase transition from a disordered to an ordered phase. The dependence of the folding rates k_F on N for lattice models and the dataset of 57 proteins and peptides shows that k_F = k_F^0 exp(-CN^beta) provides a good fit, if 0 < beta <= 2/3 and C is a constant. We find that k_F = k_F^0 exp(-1.1N^0.5) with k_F^0 =(0.4x10^-6 s)^-1 can estimate optimal protein folding rates to within an order of magnitude in most cases. By using this fit for a set of proteins with beta-sheet topology we find that k_F^0 is approximately equal to k_U^0, the prefactor for unfolding rates. The maximum ratio of k_U^0/k_F^0 is 10 for this class of proteins.
q-bio.BM:The asymmetry in the shapes of folded and unfolded states are probed using two parameters, one being a measure of the sphericity and the other that describes the shape. For the folded states, whose interiors are densely packed, the radii of gyration (Rg) and these two parameters are calculated using the coordinates of the experimentally determined structures. Although Rg scales as expected for maximally compact structures, the distributions of the shape parameters show that there is considerable asymmetry in the shapes of folded structures. The degree of asymmetry is greater for proteins that form oligomers. Analysis of the two- and three-body contacts in the native structures shows that the presence of near equal number of contacts between backbone and side-chains and between side-chains gives rise to dense packing. We suggest that proteins with relatively large values of shape parameters can tolerate volume mutations without greatly affecting the network of contacts or their stability. To probe shape characteristics of denatured states we have developed a model of a WW-like domain. The shape parameters, which are calculated using Langevin simulations, change dramatically in the course of coil to globule transition. Comparison of the values of shape parameters between the globular state and the folded state of WW domain shows that both energetic (especially dispersion in the hydrophobic interactions) and steric effects are important in determining packing in proteins.
q-bio.BM:Instead of conformation states of single residues, refined conformation states of quintuplets are proposed to reflect conformation correlation. Simple hidden Markov models combining with sliding window scores are used for predicting secondary structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. Since the length of protein conformation segments varies in a narrow range, we ignore the duration effect of the length distribution. The window scores for residues are a window version of the Chou-Fasman propensities estimated under an approximation of conditional independency. Different window widths are examined, and the optimal width is found to be 17. A high accuracy about 70% is achieved.
q-bio.BM:Is protein secondary structure primarily determined by local interactions between residues closely spaced along the amino acid backbone, or by non-local tertiary interactions? To answer this question we have measured the entropy densities of primary structure and secondary structure sequences, and the local inter-sequence mutual information density. We find that the important inter-sequence interactions are short ranged, that correlations between neighboring amino acids are essentially uninformative, and that only 1/4 of the total information needed to determine the secondary structure is available from local inter-sequence correlations. Since the remaining information must come from non-local interactions, this observation supports the view that the majority of most proteins fold via a cooperative process where secondary and tertiary structure form concurrently. To provide a more direct comparison to existing secondary structure prediction methods, we construct a simple hidden Markov model (HMM) of the sequences. This HMM achieves a prediction accuracy comparable to other single sequence secondary structure prediction algorithms, and can extract almost all of the inter-sequence mutual information. This suggests that these algorithms are almost optimal, and that we should not expect a dramatic improvement in prediction accuracy. However, local correlations between secondary and primary structure are probably of under-appreciated importance in many tertiary structure prediction methods, such as threading.
q-bio.BM:The determination of the folding mechanisms of proteins is critical to understand the topological change that can propagate Alzheimer and Creutzfeld-Jakobs diseases, among others. The computational community has paid considerable attention to this problem; however, the associated time scale, typically on the order of milliseconds or more, represents a formidable challenge. Ab initio protein folding from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or ensemble dynamics is not feasible with ordinary computing facilities and new techniques must be introduced. Here we present a detailed study of the folding of a 16-residue beta-hairpin, described by a generic energy model and using the activation-relaxation technique. From a total of 90 trajectories at 300 K, three folding pathways emerge. All involve a simultaneous optimization of the complete hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. The first two follow closely those observed by previous theoretical studies. The third pathway, never observed by previous all-atom folding, unfolding and equilibrium simulations, can be described as a reptation move of one strand of the beta-sheet with respect to the other. This reptation move indicates that non-native interactions can play a dominant role in the folding of secondary structures. These results point to a more complex folding picture than expected for a simple beta-hairpin.
q-bio.BM:Analytic estimates for the forces and free energy generated by bilayer deformation reveal a compelling and intuitive model for MscL channel gating analogous to the nucleation of a second phase. We argue that the competition between hydrophobic mismatch and tension results in a surprisingly rich story which can provide both a quantitative comparison to measurements of opening tension for MscL when reconstituted in bilayers of different thickness and qualitative insights into the function of the MscL channel and other transmembrane proteins.
q-bio.BM:It is important to understand how protein folding and evolution influences each other. Several studies based on entropy calculation correlating experimental measurement of residue participation in folding nucleus and sequence conservation have reached different conclusions. Here we report analysis of conservation of folding nucleus using an evolutionary model alternative to entropy based approaches. We employ a continuous time Markov model of codon substitution to distinguish mutation fixed by evolution and mutation fixed by chance. This model takes into account bias in codon frequency, bias favoring transition over transversion, as well as explicit phylogenetic information. We measure selection pressure using the ratio $\omega$ of synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitution at individual residue site. The $\omega$-values are estimated using the {\sc Paml} method, a maximum-likelihood estimator. Our results show that there is little correlation between the extent of kinetic participation in protein folding nucleus as measured by experimental $\phi$-value and selection pressure as measured by $\omega$-value. In addition, two randomization tests failed to show that folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved than the whole protein. These results suggest that at the level of codon substitution, there is no indication that folding nucleus residues are significantly more conserved than other residues. We further reconstruct candidate ancestral residues of the folding nucleus and suggest possible test tube mutation studies of ancient folding nucleus.
q-bio.BM:Many signalling functions in molecular biology require proteins bind to substrates such as DNA in response to environmental signals such as the simultaneous binding to a small molecule. Examples are repressor proteins which may transmit information via a conformational change in response to the ligand binding. An alternative entropic mechanism of ``allostery'' suggests that the inducer ligand changes the intramolecular vibrational entropy not just the static structure. We present a quantitative, coarse-grained model of entropic allostery that suggests design rules for internal cohesive potentials in proteins employing this effect. It also addresses the issue of how the signal information to bind or unbind is transmitted through the protein. The model may be applicable to a wide range of repressors and also to signalling in transmembrane proteins.
q-bio.BM:How DNA repair enzymes find the relatively rare sites of damage is not known in great detail. Recent experiments and molecular data suggest that the individual repair enzymes do not work independently of each other, but rather interact with each other through currents exchanged along DNA. A damaged site in DNA hinders this exchange and this makes it possible to quickly free up resources from error free stretches of DNA. Here the size of the speedup gained from this current exchange mechanism is calculated and the characteristic length and time scales are identified. In particular for Escherichia coli we estimate the speedup to be 50000/N, where N is the number of repair enzymes participating in the current exchange mechanism. Even though N is not exactly known a speedup of order 10 is not entirely unreasonable. Furthermore upon over expression of repair enzymes the detection time only varies as one over the squareroot of N and not as 1/N. This behavior is of interest in assessing the impact of stress full and radioactive environments on individual cell mutation rates.
q-bio.BM:We study DNA adsorption and renaturation in a water-phenol two-phase system, with or without shaking. In very dilute solutions, single-stranded DNA is adsorbed at the interface in a salt-dependent manner. At high salt concentrations the adsorption is irreversible. The adsorption of the single-stranded DNA is specific to phenol and relies on stacking and hydrogen bonding. We establish the interfacial nature of a DNA renaturation at a high salt concentration. In the absence of shaking, this reaction involves an efficient surface diffusion of the single-stranded DNA chains. In the presence of a vigorous shaking, the bimolecular rate of the reaction exceeds the Smoluchowski limit for a three-dimensional diffusion-controlled reaction. DNA renaturation in these conditions is known as the Phenol Emulsion Reassociation Technique or PERT. Our results establish the interfacial nature of PERT. A comparison of this interfacial reaction with other approaches shows that PERT is the most efficient technique and reveals similarities between PERT and the renaturation performed by single-stranded nucleic acid binding proteins. Our results lead to a better understanding of the partitioning of nucleic acids in two-phase systems, and should help design improved extraction procedures for damaged nucleic acids. We present arguments in favor of a role of phenol and water-phenol interface in prebiotic chemistry. The most efficient renaturation reactions (in the presence of condensing agents or with PERT) occur in heterogeneous systems. This reveals the limitations of homogeneous approaches to the biochemistry of nucleic acids. We propose a heterogeneous approach to overcome the limitations of the homogeneous viewpoint.
q-bio.BM:Hydrophobicity is thought to be one of the primary forces driving the folding of proteins. On average, hydrophobic residues occur preferentially in the core, whereas polar residues tends to occur at the surface of a folded protein. By analyzing the known protein structures, we quantify the degree to which the hydrophobicity sequence of a protein correlates with its pattern of surface exposure. We have assessed the statistical significance of this correlation for several hydrophobicity scales in the literature, and find that the computed correlations are significant but far from optimal. We show that this less than optimal correlation arises primarily from the large degree of mutations that naturally occurring proteins can tolerate. Lesser effects are due in part to forces other than hydrophobicity and we quantify this by analyzing the surface exposure distributions of all amino acids. Lastly we show that our database findings are consistent with those found from an off-lattice hydrophobic-polar model of protein folding.
q-bio.BM:The approach for the description of the DNA conformational transformations on the mesoscopic scales in the frame of the double helix is presented. Due to consideration of the joint motions of DNA structural elements along the conformational pathways the models for different transformations may be constructed in the unifying two-component form. One component of the model is the degree of freedom of the elastic rod and another component -- the effective coordinate of the conformational transformation. The internal and external model components are interrelated, as it is characteristic for the DNA structure organization. It is shown that the kinetic energy of the conformational transformation of heterogeneous DNA may be put in homogeneous form. In the frame of the developed approach the static excitations of the DNA structure under the transitions between the stable states are found for internal and external components. The comparison of the data obtained with the experiment on intrinsic DNA deformability shows good qualitative agreement. The conclusion is made that the found excitations in the DNA structure may be classificated as the static conformational solitons.
q-bio.BM:Molecular combing is a powerful and simple method for aligning DNA molecules onto a surface. Using this technique combined with fluorescence microscopy, we observed that the length of lambda-DNA molecules was extended to about 1.6 times their contour length (unextended length, 16.2 micrometers) by the combing method on hydrophobic polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) coated surfaces. The effects of sodium and magnesium ions and pH of the DNA solution were investigated. Interestingly, we observed force-induced melting of single DNA molecules.
q-bio.BM:Using a Brownian dynamics simulation, we numerically studied the interaction of DNA with histone and proposed an octamer-rotation model to describe the process of nucleosome formation. Nucleosome disruption under stretching was also simulated. The theoretical curves of extension versus time as well as of force versus extension are consistent with previous experimental results.
q-bio.BM:We propose a two-dimensional model for a complete description of the dynamics of molecular motors, including both the processive movement along track filaments and the dissociation from the filaments. The theoretical results on the distributions of the run length and dwell time at a given ATP concentration, the dependences of mean run length, mean dwell time and mean velocity on ATP concentration and load are in good agreement with the previous experimental results.
q-bio.BM:Kinesin motors have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically. However, the microscopic mechanism of the processive movement of kinesin is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a hand-over-hand model for the processivity of kinesin, which is based on chemical, mechanical, and electrical couplings. In the model the processive movement does not need to rely on the two heads' coordination in their ATP hydrolysis and mechanical cycles. Rather, the ATP hydrolyses at the two heads are independent. The much higher ATPase rate at the trailing head than the leading head makes the motor walk processively in a natural way, with one ATP being hydrolyzed per step. The model is consistent with the structural study of kinesin and the measured pathway of the kinesin ATPase. Using the model the estimated driving force of ~ 5.8 pN is in agreements with the experimental results (5~7.5 pN). The prediction of the moving time in one step (~10 microseconds) is also consistent with the measured values of 0~50 microseconds. The previous observation of substeps within the 8-nm step is explained. The shapes of velocity-load (both positive and negative) curves show resemblance to previous experimental results.
q-bio.BM:Myosin V and myosin VI are two classes of two-headed molecular motors of the myosin superfamily that move processively along helical actin filaments in opposite directions. Here we present a hand-over-hand model for their processive movements. In the model, the moving direction of a dimeric molecular motor is automatically determined by the relative orientation between its two heads at free state and its head's binding orientation on track filament. This determines that myosin V moves toward the barbed end and myosin VI moves toward the pointed end of actin. During the moving period in one step, one head remains bound to actin for myosin V whereas two heads are detached for myosin VI: The moving manner is determined by the length of neck domain. This naturally explains the similar dynamic behaviors but opposite moving directions of myosin VI and mutant myosin V (the neck of which is truncated to only one-sixth of the native length). Because of different moving manners, myosin VI and mutant myosin V exhibit significantly broader step-size distribution than native myosin V. However, all three motors give the same mean step size of 36 nm (the pseudo-repeat of actin helix). Using the model we study the dynamics of myosin V quantitatively, with theoretical results in agreement with previous experimental ones.
q-bio.BM:We describe a faster and more accurate algorithm for computing the statistical mechanics of DNA denaturation according to the Poland-Scheraga type. Nearest neighbor thermodynamics is included in a complete and general way. The algorithm represents an optimization with respect to algorithmic complexity of the partition function algorithm of Yeramian et al.: We reduce the computation time for a base-pairing probability profile from O(N2) to O(N). This speed-up comes in addition to the speed-up due to a multiexponential approximation of the loop entropy factor as introduced by Fixman and Freire. The speed-up, however, is independent of the multiexponential approximation and reduces time from O(N3) to O(N2) in the exact case. In addition to calculating the standard base-pairing probability profiles, we propose to use the algorithm to calculate various other probabilities (loops, helices, tails) for a more direct view of the melting regions and their positions and sizes.
q-bio.BM:A joint experimental / theoretical investigation of the elastin-like octapeptide GVG(VPGVG) was carried out. In this paper a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of the temperature dependent folding and unfolding of the octapeptide is presented. The current study, as well as its experimental counterpart find that this peptide undergoes an "inverse temperature transition", ITT, leading to a folding at about 310-330 K. In addition, an unfolding transition is identified at unusually high temperatures approaching the boiling point of water. Due to the small size of the system two broad temperature regimes are found: the "ITT regime" (at about 280-320 K) and the "unfolding regime" at about T > 330 K, where the peptide has a maximum probability of being folded at approximately 330 K. A detailed molecular picture involving a thermodynamic order parameter, or reaction coordinate, for this process is presented along with a time-correlation function analysis of the hydrogen bond dynamics within the peptide as well as between the peptide and solvating water molecules. Correlation with experimental evidence and ramifications on the properties of elastin are discussed.
q-bio.BM:A simplified model for the closed circular DNA (ccDNA) is proposed to describe some specific features of the helix-coil transition in such molecule. The Hamiltonian of ccDNA is related to the one introduced earlier for the linear DNA. The basic assumption is that the reduced energy of the hydrogen bond is not constant through the transition process but depends effectively on the fraction of already broken bonds. A transformation formula is obtained which relates the temperature of ccDNA at a given degree of helicity during the transition to the temperature of the corresponding linear chain at the same degree of helicity. The formula provides a simple method to calculate the melting curve for the ccDNA from the experimental melting curve of the linear DNA with the same nucleotide sequence.
q-bio.BM:We develop a simple but rigorous model of protein-protein association kinetics based on diffusional association on free energy landscapes obtained by sampling configurations within and surrounding the native complex binding funnels. Guided by results obtained on exactly solvable model problems, we transform the problem of diffusion in a potential into free diffusion in the presence of an absorbing zone spanning the entrance to the binding funnel. The free diffusion problem is solved using a recently derived analytic expression for the rate of association of asymmetrically oriented molecules. Despite the required high steric specificity and the absence of long-range attractive interactions, the computed rates are typically on the order of 10^4-10^6 M-1 s-1, several orders of magnitude higher than rates obtained using a purely probabilistic model in which the association rate for free diffusion of uniformly reactive molecules is multiplied by the probability of a correct alignment of the two partners in a random collision. As the association rates of many protein-protein complexes are also in the 10^5-10^6 M-1 s-1, our results suggest that free energy barriers arising from desolvation and/or side-chain freezing during complex formation or increased ruggedness within the binding funnel, which are completely neglected in our simple diffusional model, do not contribute significantly to the dynamics of protein-protein association. The transparent physical interpretation of our approach that computes association rates directly from the size and geometry of protein-protein binding funnels makes it a useful complement to Brownian dynamics simulations.
q-bio.BM:Functional proteins must fold with some minimal stability to a structure that can perform a biochemical task. Here we use a simple model to investigate the relationship between the stability requirement and the capacity of a protein to evolve the function of binding to a ligand. Although our model contains no built-in tradeoff between stability and function, proteins evolved function more efficiently when the stability requirement was relaxed. Proteins with both high stability and high function evolved more efficiently when the stability requirement was gradually increased than when there was constant selection for high stability. These results show that in our model, the evolution of function is enhanced by allowing proteins to explore sequences corresponding to marginally stable structures, and that it is easier to improve stability while maintaining high function than to improve function while maintaining high stability. Our model also demonstrates that even in the absence of a fundamental biophysical tradeoff between stability and function, the speed with which function can evolve is limited by the stability requirement imposed on the protein.
q-bio.BM:Using the model for the processive movement of a dimeric kinesin we proposed before, we study the dynamics of a number of mutant homodimeric and heterodimeric kinesins that were constructed by Kaseda et al. (Kaseda, K., Higuchi, H. and Hirose, K. PNAS 99, 16058 (2002)). The theoretical results of ATPase rate per head, moving velocity, and stall force of the motors show good agreement with the experimental results by Kaseda et al.: The puzzling dynamic behaviors of heterodimeric kinesin that consists of two distinct heads compared with its parent homodimers can be easily explained by using independent ATPase rates of the two heads in our model. We also study the collective kinetic behaviors of kinesins in MT-gliding motility. The results explains well that the average MT-gliding velocity is independent of the number of bound motors and is equal to the moving velocity of a single kinesin relative to MT.
q-bio.BM:The simplest approximation of interaction potential between amino-acids in proteins is the contact potential, which defines the effective free energy of a protein conformation by a set of amino acid contacts formed in this conformation. Finding a contact potential capable of predicting free energies of protein states across a variety of protein families will aid protein folding and engineering in silico on a computationally tractable time-scale. We test the ability of contact potentials to accurately and transferably (across various protein families) predict stability changes of proteins upon mutations. We develop a new methodology to determine the contact potentials in proteins from experimental measurements of changes in protein thermodynamic stabilities (ddG) upon mutations. We apply our methodology to derive sets of contact interaction parameters for a hierarchy of interaction models including solvation and multi-body contact parameters. We test how well our models reproduce experimental measurements by statistical tests. We evaluate the maximum accuracy of predictions obtained by using contact potentials and the correlation between parameters derived from different data-sets of experimental ddG values. We argue that it is impossible to reach experimental accuracy and derive fully transferable contact parameters using the contact models of potentials. However, contact parameters can yield reliable predictions of ddG for datasets of mutations confined to specific amino-acid positions in the sequence of a single protein.
q-bio.BM:We first review how to determine the rate of vibrational energy relaxation (VER) using perturbation theory. We then apply those theoretical results to the problem of VER of a CD stretching mode in the protein cytochrome c. We model cytochrome c in vacuum as a normal mode system with the lowest-order anharmonic coupling elements. We find that, for the ``lifetime'' width parameter $\gamma=3 \sim 30$ cm$^{-1}$, the VER time is $0.2 \sim 0.3$ ps, which agrees rather well with the previous classical calculation using the quantum correction factor method, and is consistent with spectroscopic experiments by Romesberg's group. We decompose the VER rate into separate contributions from two modes, and find that the most significant contribution, which depends on the ``lifetime'' width parameter, comes from those modes most resonant with the CD vibrational mode.
q-bio.BM:The three-dimensional structures of two common repeat motifs Val$^1$-Pro$^2$-Gly$^3$-Val$^4$-Gly$^5$ and Val$^1$-Gly$^2$-Val$^3$-Pro$^4$-Gly$^5$-Val$^6$-Gly$^7$-Val$^8$-Pro$^9$ of tropoelastin are investigated by using the multicanonical simulation procedure. By minimizing the energy structures along the trajectory the thermodynamically most stable low-energy microstates of the molecule are determined. The structural predictions are in good agreement with X-ray diffraction experiments.
q-bio.BM:We address the controversial hot question concerning the validity of the loose-coupling versus the lever-arm models in the actomyosin dynamics by re-interpreting and extending the washboard potential model proposed by some of us in a previous paper. In the new theory, a loose-coupling mechanism co-exists with the deterministic lever-arm model. The synergetic action of a random component, originating from the harnessed thermal energy, and of the power-stroke generated by the lever-arm classical mechanism is seen to yield an excellent fit of the set of data obtained in T. Yanagida's laboratory on the sliding of Myosin II heads on actin filaments under various load conditions. Our theoretical arguments are complemented by accurate numerical simulations, and the robustness of theory is tested via different combination of parameters and potential profiles.
q-bio.BM:In simple models side chains are often represented implicitly (e.g., by spin-states) or simplified as one atom. We study side chain effects using square lattice and tetrahedral lattice models, with explicitly side chains of two atoms. We distinguish effects due to chirality and effects due to side chain flexibilities, since residues in proteins are L-residues, and their side chains adopt different rotameric states. Short chains are enumerated exhaustively. For long chains, we sample effectively rare events (eg, compact conformations) and obtain complete pictures of ensemble properties of these models at all compactness region. We find that both chirality and reduced side chain flexibility lower the folding entropy significantly for globally compact conformations, suggesting that they are important properties of residues to ensure fast folding and stable native structure. This corresponds well with our finding that natural amino acid residues have reduced effective flexibility, as evidenced by analysis of rotamer libraries and side chain rotatable bonds. We further develop a method calculating the exact side-chain entropy for a given back bone structure. We show that simple rotamer counting often underestimates side chain entropy significantly, and side chain entropy does not always correlate well with main chain packing. Among compact backbones with maximum side chain entropy, helical structures emerges as the dominating configurations. Our results suggest that side chain entropy may be an important factor contributing to the formation of alpha helices for compact conformations.
q-bio.BM:We show that the contact map of the native structure of globular proteins can be reconstructed starting from the sole knowledge of the contact map's principal eigenvector, and present an exact algorithm for this purpose. Our algorithm yields a unique contact map for all 221 globular structures of PDBselect25 of length $N \le 120$. We also show that the reconstructed contact maps allow in turn for the accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional structure. These results indicate that the reduced vectorial representation provided by the principal eigenvector of the contact map is equivalent to the protein structure itself. This representation is expected to provide a useful tool in bioinformatics algorithms for protein structure comparison and alignment, as well as a promising intermediate step towards protein structure prediction.
q-bio.BM:Function of proteins or a network of interacting proteins often involves communication between residues that are well separated in sequence. The classic example is the participation of distant residues in allosteric regulation. Bioinformatic and structural analysis methods have been introduced to infer residues that are correlated. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to obtain the sequence properties that determine the tendency of disease related proteins (Abeta peptides, prion proteins, transthyretin etc.) to aggregate and form fibrils. Motivated in part by the need to identify sequence characteristics that indicate a tendency to aggregate, we introduce a general method that probes covariations in charged residues along the sequence in a given protein family. The method, which involves computing the Sequence Correlation Entropy (SCE) using the quenched probability Psk(i,j) of finding a residue pair at a given sequence separation sk, allows us to classify protein families in terms of their SCE. Our general approach may be a useful way in obtaining evolutionary covariations of amino acid residues on a genome wide level.
q-bio.BM:We present an analysis of the effects of global topology on the structural stability of folded proteins in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath. For a large class of single domain proteins, we computed the harmonic spectrum within the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and determined the spectral dimension, a parameter describing the low frequency behaviour of the density of modes. We find a surprisingly strong correlation between the spectral dimension and the number of amino acids of the protein. Considering that larger spectral dimension value relate to more topologically compact folded state, our results indicate that for a given temperature and length of the protein, the folded structure corresponds to the less compact folding compatible with thermodynamic stability.
q-bio.BM:We present a simple physical model which demonstrates that the native state folds of proteins can emerge on the basis of considerations of geometry and symmetry. We show that the inherent anisotropy of a chain molecule, the geometrical and energetic constraints placed by the hydrogen bonds and sterics, and hydrophobicity are sufficient to yield a free energy landscape with broad minima even for a homopolymer. These minima correspond to marginally compact structures comprising the menu of folds that proteins choose from to house their native-states in. Our results provide a general framework for understanding the common characteristics of globular proteins.
q-bio.BM:With the aim to study the relationship between protein sequences and their native structures, we adopt vectorial representations for both sequence and structure. The structural representation is based on the Principal Eigenvector of the fold's contact matrix (PE). As recently shown, the latter encodes sufficient information for reconstructing the whole contact matrix. The sequence is represented through a Hydrophobicity Profile (HP), using a generalized hydrophobicity scale that we obtain from the principal eigenvector of a residue-residue interaction matrix and denote it as interactivity scale. Using this novel scale, we define the optimal HP of a protein fold, and predict, by means of stability arguments, that it is strongly correlated with the PE of the fold's contact matrix. This prediction is confirmed through an evolutionary analysis, which shows that the PE correlates with the HP of each individual sequence adopting the same fold and, even more strongly, with the average HP of this set of sequences. Thus, protein sequences evolve in such a way that their average HP is close to the optimal one, implying that neutral evolution can be viewed as a kind of motion in sequence space around the optimal HP. Our results indicate that the correlation coefficient between N-dimensional vectors constitutes a natural metric in the vectorial space in which we represent both protein sequences and protein structures, which we call Vectorial Protein Space. In this way, we define a unified framework for sequence to sequence, sequence to structure, and structure to structure alignments. We show that the interactivity scale is nearly optimal both for the comparison of sequences with sequences and sequences with structures.
q-bio.BM:We fit the Fourier transforms of solvent accessibility and hydrophobicity profiles of a representative set of proteins to a joint multi-variable Gaussian. This allows us to separate the intrinsic tendencies of sequence and structure profiles from the interactions that correlate them; for example, the $\alpha$-helix periodicity in sequence hydrophobicity is dictated by the solvent accessibility of structures. The distinct intrinsic tendencies of sequence and structure profiles are most pronounced at long periods, where sequence hydrophobicity fluctuates more, while solvent accessibility fluctuations are less than average. Interestingly, correlations between the two profiles can be interpreted as the Boltzmann weight of the solvation energy at room temperature.
q-bio.BM:In this paper, we examine the mechanical role of the lipid bilayer in ion channel conformation and function with specific reference to the case of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). In a recent paper (Wiggins and Phillips, 2004), we argued that mechanotransduction very naturally arises from lipid-protein interactions by invoking a simple analytic model of the MscL channel and the surrounding lipid bilayer. In this paper, we focus on improving and expanding this analytic framework for studying lipid-protein interactions with special attention to MscL. Our goal is to generate simple scaling relations which can be used to provide qualitative understanding of the role of membrane mechanics in protein function and to quantitatively interpret experimental results. For the MscL channel, we find that the free energies induced by lipid-protein interaction are of the same order as the free energy differences between conductance states measured by Sukharev et al. (1999). We therefore conclude that the mechanics of the bilayer plays an essential role in determining the conformation and function of the channel. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental results from the recent investigations of the MscL channel by Perozo et al. (2002), Powl et al. (2003), Yoshimura et al. (2004), and others and suggest a suite of new experiments.
q-bio.BM:The conjunction of insights from structural biology, solution biochemistry, genetics and single molecule biophysics has provided a renewed impetus for the construction of quantitative models of biological processes. One area that has been a beneficiary of these experimental techniques is the study of viruses. In this paper we describe how the insights obtained from such experiments can be utilized to construct physical models of processes in the viral life cycle. We focus on dsDNA bacteriophages and show that the bending elasticity of DNA and its electrostatics in solution can be combined to determine the forces experienced during packaging and ejection of the viral genome. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the effect of fluid viscosity and capsid expansion on the forces experienced during packaging. Finally, we present a model for DNA ejection from bacteriophages based on the hypothesis that the energy stored in the tightly packed genome within the capsid leads to its forceful ejection. The predictions of our model can be tested through experiments in vitro where DNA ejection is inhibited by the application of external osmotic pressure.
q-bio.BM:Amyloid fibers are aggregates of proteins. They are built out of a peptide called $\beta$--amyloid (A$\beta$) containing between 41 and 43 residues, produced by the action of an enzyme which cleaves a much larger protein known as the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). X-ray diffraction experiments have shown that these fibrils are rich in $\beta$--structures, whereas the shape of the peptide displays an $\alpha$--helix structure within the APP in its biologically active conformation. A realistic model of fibril formation is developed based on the seventeen residues A$\beta$12--28 amyloid peptide, which has been shown to form fibrils structurally similar to those of the whole A$\beta$ peptide. With the help of physical arguments and in keeping with experimental findings, the A$\beta$12--28 monomer is assumed to be in four possible states (i.e., native helix conformation, $\beta$--hairpin, globular low--energy state and unfolded state). Making use of these monomeric states, oligomers (dimers, tertramers and octamers) were constructed. With the help of short, detailed Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations of the three monomers and of a variety of oligomers, energies for these structures were obtained. Making use of these results within the framework of a simple yet realistic model to describe the entropic terms associated with the variety of amyloid conformations, a phase diagram can be calculated of the whole many--body system, leading to a thermodynamical picture in overall agreement with the experimental findings. In particular, the existence of micellar metastable states seem to be a key issue to determine the thermodynamical properties of the system.
q-bio.BM:The possibility of deriving the contact potentials between amino acids from their frequencies of occurence in proteins is discussed in evolutionary terms. This approach allows the use of traditional thermodynamics to describe such frequencies and, consequently, to develop a strategy to include in the calculations correlations due to the spatial proximity of the amino acids and to their overall tendency of being conserved in proteins. Making use of a lattice model to describe protein chains and defining a "true" potential, we test these strategies by selecting a database of folding model sequences, deriving the contact potentials from such sequences and comparing them with the "true" potential. Taking into account correlations allows for a markedly better prediction of the interaction potentials.
q-bio.BM:While all the information required for the folding of a protein is contained in its amino acid sequence, one has not yet learned how to extract this information to predict the three--dimensional, biologically active, native conformation of a protein whose sequence is known. Using insight obtained from simple model simulations of the folding of proteins, in particular of the fact that this phenomenon is essentially controlled by conserved (native) contacts among (few) strongly interacting ("hot"), as a rule hydrophobic, amino acids, which also stabilize local elementary structures (LES, hidden, incipient secondary structures like $\alpha$--helices and $\beta$--sheets) formed early in the folding process and leading to the postcritical folding nucleus (i.e., the minimum set of native contacts which bring the system pass beyond the highest free--energy barrier found in the whole folding process) it is possible to work out a succesful strategy for reading the native structure of designed proteins from the knowledge of only their amino acid sequence and of the contact energies among the amino acids. Because LES have undergone millions of years of evolution to selectively dock to their complementary structures, small peptides made out of the same amino acids as the LES are expected to selectively attach to the newly expressed (unfolded) protein and inhibit its folding, or to the native (fluctuating) native conformation and denaturate it. These peptides, or their mimetic molecules, can thus be used as effective non--conventional drugs to those already existing (and directed at neutralizing the active site of enzymes), displaying the advantage of not suffering from the uprise of resistance.
q-bio.BM:Methods for alignment of protein sequences typically measure similarity by using substitution matrix with scores for all possible exchanges of one amino acid with another. Although widely used, the matrices derived from homologous sequence segments, such as Dayhoff's PAM matrices and Henikoff's BLOSUM matrices, are not specific for protein conformation identification. Using a different approach, we got many amino acid segment blocks. For each of them, the protein secondary structure is identical. Based on these blocks, we have derived new amino acid substitution matrices. The application of these matrices led to marked improvements in conformation segment search and homologues detection in twilight zone.
q-bio.BM:The advent of new experimental genomic technologies and the massive increase of DNA sequence information is helping researchers better understand how our genes work. Recently, experiments on mRNA abundance (gene expression) have revealed that gene expression shows a stationary organization described by a power-law distribution (scale-free organization) (i.e., gene expression $k$ decays as $k^{-\gamma}$), which is highly conserved in all the major five kingdoms of life, from Bacteria to Human. An underlying gene expression dynamics "rich-travel-more" was suggested to recover that evolutional conservation of transcriptional organization. Here we propose a constructive approach to gene expression dynamics with larger scope. Our gene expression construction restores the stationary state, predicts the power-law exponent for different organisms with natural explanation for small correction at high and low expression levels, describes the intermediate state dynamics (time finite) and elucidates the gene expression stability. This approach requires only one assumption: Markov property.
q-bio.BM:Proteins are minimally frustrated polymers. However, for realistic protein models non-native interactions must be taken into account. In this paper we analyze the effect of non-native interactions on the folding rate and on the folding free energy barrier. We present an analytic theory to account for the modification on the free energy landscape upon introduction of non-native contacts, added as a perturbation to the strong native interactions driving folding. Our theory predicts a rate-enhancement regime at fixed temperature, under the introduction of weak, non-native interactions. We have thoroughly tested this theoretical prediction with simulations of a coarse-grained protein model, by employing an off-lattice $C_\alpha$ model of the src-SH3 domain. The strong agreement between results from simulations and theory confirm the non trivial result that a relatively small amount of non-native interaction energy can actually assist the folding to the native structure.
q-bio.BM:An effective potential function is critical for protein structure prediction and folding simulation. For simplified models of proteins where coordinates of only $C_\alpha$ atoms need to be specified, an accurate potential function is important. Such a simplified model is essential for efficient search of conformational space. In this work, we present a formulation of potential function for simplified representations of protein structures. It is based on the combination of descriptors derived from residue-residue contact and sequence-dependent local geometry. The optimal weight coefficients for contact and local geometry is obtained through optimization by maximizing margins among native and decoy structures. The latter are generated by chain growth and by gapless threading. The performance of the potential function in blind test of discriminating native protein structures from decoys is evaluated using several benchmark decoy sets. This potential function have comparable or better performance than several residue-based potential functions that require in addition coordinates of side chain centers or coordinates of all side chain atoms.
q-bio.BM:Circular permutation connects the N and C termini of a protein and concurrently cleaves elsewhere in the chain, providing an important mechanism for generating novel protein fold and functions. However, their in genomes is unknown because current detection methods can miss many occurances, mistaking random repeats as circular permutation. Here we develop a method for detecting circularly permuted proteins from structural comparison. Sequence order independent alignment of protein structures can be regarded as a special case of the maximum-weight independent set problem, which is known to be computationally hard. We develop an efficient approximation algorithm by repeatedly solving relaxations of an appropriate intermediate integer programming formulation, we show that the approximation ratio is much better then the theoretical worst case ratio of $r = 1/4$. Circularly permuted proteins reported in literature can be identified rapidly with our method, while they escape the detection by publicly available servers for structural alignment.
q-bio.BM:Motivation. Protein design aims to identify sequences compatible with a given protein fold but incompatible to any alternative folds. To select the correct sequences and to guide the search process, a design scoring function is critically important. Such a scoring function should be able to characterize the global fitness landscape of many proteins simultaneously.   Results. To find optimal design scoring functions, we introduce two geometric views and propose a formulation using mixture of nonlinear Gaussian kernel functions. We aim to solve a simplified protein sequence design problem. Our goal is to distinguish each native sequence for a major portion of representative protein structures from a large number of alternative decoy sequences, each a fragment from proteins of different fold. Our scoring function discriminate perfectly a set of 440 native proteins from 14 million sequence decoys. We show that no linear scoring function can succeed in this task. In a blind test of unrelated proteins, our scoring function misclassfies only 13 native proteins out of 194. This compares favorably with about 3-4 times more misclassifications when optimal linear functions reported in literature are used. We also discuss how to develop protein folding scoring function.
q-bio.BM:Being HIV-1-PR an essential enzyme in the viral life cycle, its inhibition can control AIDS. Because the folding of single domain proteins, like HIV-1-PR is controlled by local elementary structures (LES, folding units stabilized by strongly interacting, highly conserved amino acids) which have evolved over myriads of generations to recognize and strongly attract each other so as to make the protein fold fast, we suggest a novel type of HIV-1-PR inhibitors which interfere with the folding of the protein: short peptides displaying the same amino acid sequence of that of LES. Theoretical and experimental evidence for the specificity and efficiency of such inhibitors are presented.
q-bio.BM:Vibrational energy relaxation (VER) of a selected mode in cytochrome c (hemeprotein) in vacuum is studied using two theoretical approaches: One is the equilibrium simulation approach with quantum correction factors, and the other is the reduced model approach which describes the protein as an ensemble of normal modes coupled with nonlinear coupling elements. Both methods result in estimates of VER time (sub ps) for a CD stretching mode in the protein at room temperature, that are in accord with the experimental data of Romesberg's group. The applicability of the two methods is examined through a discussion of the validity of Fermi's golden rule on which the two methods are based.
q-bio.BM:The 16-22 amino acid fragment of the beta-amyloid peptide associated with the Alzheimer's disease, Abeta, is capable of forming amyloid fibrils. Here we study the aggregation mechanism of Abeta(16-22) peptides by unbiased thermodynamic simulations at the atomic level for systems of one, three and six Abeta(16-22) peptides. We find that the isolated Abeta(16-22) peptide is mainly a random coil in the sense that both the alpha-helix and beta-strand contents are low, whereas the three- and six-chain systems form aggregated structures with a high beta-sheet content. Furthermore, in agreement with experiments on Abeta(16-22) fibrils, we find that large parallel beta-sheets are unlikely to form. For the six-chain system, the aggregated structures can have many different shapes, but certain particularly stable shapes can be identified.
q-bio.BM:We identified latent periodicity in catalytic domains of approximately 85% of serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases. Similar results were obtained for other 22 protein domains. We also designed the method of noise decomposition, which is aimed to distinguish between different periodicity types of the same period length. The method is to be used in conjunction with the cyclic profile alignment, and this combination is able to reveal structure-related or function-related patterns of latent periodicity. Possible origins of the periodic structure of protein kinase active sites are discussed. Summarizing, we presume that latent periodicity is the common property of many catalytic protein domains.
q-bio.BM:We found latent periodicity of 150 protein families now. We suppose that latent periodicity can determine a spectrum of resonance oscillations in proteins.
q-bio.BM:Proteins have regular tertiary structures but irregular amino acid sequences. This made it very difficult to decode the structural information in the protein sequences. Here we demonstrate that many small alpha protein domains have hidden sequence symmetries characteristic of their pseudo-symmetric tertiary structures. We also present a modified method of recurrent plot to reveal this kind of the hidden sequence symmetry. The results may enable us understand parts of the relations between protein sequences and their tertiary structures, i.e, how the primary sequence of a protein determines its tertiary structure.

q-bio.BM:Activated processes such as protein unfolding are highly sensitive to heterogeneity in the environment. We study a highly simplified model of a protein in a random heterogeneous environment, a model of the in vivo environment. It is found that if the heterogeneity is sufficiently large the total rate of the process is essentially a random variable; this may be the cause of the species-to-species variability in the rate of prion protein conversion found by Deleault et al. [Nature, 425 (2003) 717].
q-bio.BM:Water molecules and molecular chaperones efficiently help the protein folding process. Here we describe their action in the context of the energy and topological networks of proteins. In energy terms water and chaperones were suggested to decrease the activation energy between various local energy minima smoothing the energy landscape, rescuing misfolded proteins from conformational traps and stabilizing their native structure. In kinetic terms water and chaperones may make the punctuated equilibrium of conformational changes less punctuated and help protein relaxation. Finally, water and chaperones may help the convergence of multiple energy landscapes during protein-macromolecule interactions. We also discuss the possibility of the introduction of protein games to narrow the multitude of the energy landscapes when a protein binds to another macromolecule. Both water and chaperones provide a diffuse set of rapidly fluctuating weak links (low affinity and low probability interactions), which allow the generalization of all these statements to a multitude of networks.
q-bio.BM:Nucleosomes organize the folding of DNA into chromatin and significantly influence transcription, replication, regulation and repair. All atom molecular dynamics simulations of a nucleosome and of its 146 basepairs of DNA free in solution have been conducted. DNA helical parameters are extracted from each trajectory to compare the conformation, effective force constants, persistence length measures, and fluctuations of nucleosomal DNA to free DNA. A method for disassembling and reconstructing the conformation and dynamics of the nucleosome using Fourier analysis is presented. Results indicate that the superhelical path of DNA in the nucleosome is irregular. Long length variations in the conformation of nucleosomal DNA are identified other than those associated with helix repeat. These variations are required to create a proposed tetrasome conformation or to qualitatively reconstruct the 1.75 turns of the nuclesomal superhelix. Free DNA achieves enough bend and shear in solution to create an ideal nucleosome superhelix, but these deformations are not organized so the conformation is essentially linear. Reconstruction of free DNA using selected long wavelength variations in conformation can produce either a left-handed or a right-handed superhelix. DNA is less flexible in the nucleosome than when free in solution, however such measures are length scale dependent.
q-bio.BM:Gene expression analysis by means of microarrays is based on the sequence specific binding of mRNA to DNA oligonucleotide probes and its measurement using fluorescent labels. The binding of RNA fragments involving other sequences than the intended target is problematic because it adds a "chemical background" to the signal, which is not related to the expression degree of the target gene. The paper presents a molecular signature of specific and non specific hybridization with potential consequences for gene expression analysis. We analyzed the signal intensities of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes of GeneChip microarrays to specify the effect of specific and non specific hybridization. We found that these events give rise to different relations between the PM and MM intensities as function of the middle base of the PMs, namely a triplet- (C>G=T>A>0) and a duplet-like (C=T>0>G=A) pattern of the PM-MM log-intensity difference upon binding of specific and non specific RNA fragments, respectively. The systematic behaviour of the intensity difference can be rationalized on the level of base pairings of DNA/RNA oligonucleotide duplexes in the middle of the probe sequence. Non-specific binding is characterized by the reversal of the central Watson Crick (WC) pairing for each PM/MM probe pair, whereas specific binding refers to the combination of a WC and a self complementary (SC) pairing in PM and MM probes, respectively. The intensity of complementary MM introduces a systematic source of variation which decreases the precision of expression measures based on the MM intensities.
q-bio.BM:We implement the replica exchange molecular dynamics algorithm to study the interactions of a model peptide (WALP-16) with an explicitly represented DPPC membrane bilayer. We observe the spontaneous, unbiased insertion of WALP-16 into the DPPC bilayer and its folding into an a-helix with a trans-bilayer orientation. We observe that the insertion of the peptide into the DPPC bilayer precedes secondary structure formation. Although the peptide has some propensity to form a partially helical structure in the interfacial region of the DPPC/water system, this state is not a productive intermediate but rather an off-pathway trap for WALP-16 insertion. Equilibrium simulations show that the observed insertion/folding pathway mirrors the potential of mean force (PMF). Calculation of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to this PMF show that the surface bound conformation of WALP-16 is significantly lower in energy than other conformations, and that the insertion of WALP-16 into the bilayer without regular secondary structure is enthalpically unfavorable by 5-10 kcal/mol/residue. The observed insertion/folding pathway disagrees with the dominant conceptual model, which is that a surface bound helix is an obligatory intermediate for the insertion of a-helical peptides into lipid bilayers. In our simulations, the observed insertion/folding pathway is favored because of a large (> 100 kcal/mol) increase in system entropy that occurs when the unstructured WALP-16 peptide enters the lipid bilayer interior. The insertion/folding pathway that is lowest in free energy depends sensitively on the near cancellation of large enthalpic and entropic terms. This suggests that intrinsic membrane peptides may have a diversity of insertion/folding behaviors depending on the exact system of peptide and lipid under consideration.
q-bio.BM:Analysis of data from an Affymetrix Latin Square spike-in experiment indicates that measured fluorescence intensities of features on an oligonucleotide microarray are related to spike-in RNA target concentrations via a hyperbolic response function, generally identified as a Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Furthermore the asymptotic signal at high spike-in concentrations is almost invariably lower for a mismatch feature than for its partner perfect match feature. We survey a number of theoretical adsorption models of hybridization at the microarray surface and find that in general they are unable to explain the differing saturation responses of perfect and mismatch features. On the other hand, we find that a simple and consistent explanation can be found in a model in which equilibrium hybridization followed by partial dissociation of duplexes during the post-hybridization washing phase.
q-bio.BM:A model for the processive movement of dynein is presented based on experimental observations available. In the model, the change from strong microtubule-binding to weak binding of dynein is determined naturally by the variation of the relative orientation between the two interacting surfaces of the stalk tip and the microtubule as the stalk rotates from the ADP.Vi-state orientation to the apo-state orientation. This means that the puzzling communication from the ATP binding site in the globular head to the MT-binding site in the tip of the stalk, which is prerequisite in the conventional model, is not required. Using the present model, the previous experimental results, such as (i) the step size of a dynein being an integer times of the period of the MT lattice, (ii) the dependence of the step size on load, i.e., the step size decreasing with the increase of load, and (iii) the stall force being proportional to [ATP] at low [ATP] and becoming saturated at high [ATP], are well explained.
q-bio.BM:We address the controversial hot question concerning the validity of the loose coupling versus the lever-arm theories in the actomyosin dynamics by re-interpreting and extending the phenomenological washboard potential model proposed by some of us in a previous paper. In this new model a Brownian motion harnessing thermal energy is assumed to co-exist with the deterministic swing of the lever-arm, to yield an excellent fit of the set of data obtained by some of us on the sliding of Myosin II heads on immobilized actin filaments under various load conditions. Our theoretical arguments are complemented by accurate numerical simulations, and the robustness of the model is tested via different choices of parameters and potential profiles.
q-bio.BM:In this paper we investigate the role of native geometry on the kinetics of protein folding based on simple lattice models and Monte Carlo simulations. Results obtained within the scope of the Miyazawa-Jernigan indicate the existence of two dynamical folding regimes depending on the protein chain length. For chains larger than 80 amino acids the folding performance is sensitive to the native state's conformation. Smaller chains, with less than 80 amino acids, fold via two-state kinetics and exhibit a significant correlation between the contact order parameter and the logarithmic folding times. In particular, chains with N=48 amino acids were found to belong to two broad classes of folding, characterized by different cooperativity, depending on the contact order parameter. Preliminary results based on the G\={o} model show that the effect of long range contact interaction strength in the folding kinetics is largely dependent on the native state's geometry.
q-bio.BM:Monte Carlo simulations show that long-range interactions play a major role in determining the folding rates of 48-mer three-dimensional lattice polymers modelled by the Go potential. For three target structures with different native geometries we found a sharp increase in the folding time when the relative contribution of the long-range interactions to the native state's energy is decreased from ~50% towards zero. However, the dispersion of the simulated folding times depends strongly on the native geometry and Go polymers folding to one of the target structures exhibit folding times spanning three orders of magnitude. We have also found that, depending on the target geometry, a strong geometric coupling may exist between local and long-range contacts meaning that, when this coupling exists, the formation of long-range contacts is forced by the previous formation of local contacts. The absence of a strong geometric coupling leads to kinetics that are more sensitive to the interaction energy parameters; in this case the formation of local contacts is not sufficient to promote the establishment of long-range ones when these are strongly penalized energetically, leading to longer folding times.
q-bio.BM:A simplified interaction potential for protein folding studies at the atomic level is discussed and tested on a set of peptides with about 20 residues each. The test set contains both alpha-helical (Trp cage, Fs) and beta-sheet (GB1p, GB1m2, GB1m3, Betanova, LLM) peptides. The model, which is entirely sequence-based, is able to fold these different peptides for one and the same choice of model parameters. Furthermore, the melting behavior of the peptides is in good quantitative agreement with experimental data. Apparent folded populations obtained using different observables are compared, and are found to be very different for some of the peptides (e.g., Betanova). In other cases (in particular, GB1m2 and GB1m3), the different estimates agree reasonably well, indicating a more two-state-like melting behavior.
q-bio.BM:Single molecule FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) is a powerful technique for detecting real-time conformational changes and molecular interactions during biological reactions. In this review, we examine different techniques of extending observation times via immobilization and illustrate how useful biological information can be obtained from single molecule FRET time trajectories with or without absolute distance information.
q-bio.BM:An ensemble of directed macromolecules on a lattice is considered, where the constituting molecules are chosen as a random sequence of N different types. The same type of molecules experiences a hard-core (exclusion) interaction. We study the robustness of the macromolecules with respect to breaking and substituting individual molecules, using a 1/N expansion. The properties depend strongly on the density of macromolecules. In particular, the macromolecules are robust against breaking and substituting at high densities.
q-bio.BM:The vibrational dynamics of a DNA molecule with counterions neutralizing the charged phosphate groups have been studied. With the help of elaborated model the conformational vibrations of the DNA double helix with alkaline metal ions have been described both qualitatively and quantitatively. For the complexes of DNA with counterions Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+ the normal modes have been found, and a mode characterized by the most notable ion displacements with respect to the DNA backbone has been determined. The frequency of counterion vibrations has been established to decrease as the ion mass increases. The results of theoretical calculation have been showed to be in good agreement with the experimental data of Raman spectroscopy.
q-bio.BM:To understand the mechanism of TATA-box conformational transformations we model structure mobility and find the types of conformational excitations of DNA macromolecule in heteronomous conformation. We have constructed the two-component model for describing DNA conformational transformation with simultaneous transitions in the furanos rings of the monomer link. Internal component describes the change of the base pair position in the double helix. External component describes the displacement of mass center of the monomer link. Nonlinearity of the system is accounted with a form of potential energy describing C3'-C2' and C2'-C3' sugars transitions in monomer link, and interrelation between monomer conformational transition and macromolecule deformation. The comparison of our results with experimental data allows to confirm that the localized conformational excitations may realise in DNA TATA-box. These excitations cause the deformation of the macromolecule fragment.
q-bio.BM:A simple approach is proposed to investigate the protein structure. Using a low complexity model, a simple pairwise interaction and the concept of global optimization, we are able to calculate ground states of proteins, which are in agreement with experimental data. All possible model structures of small proteins are available below a certain energy threshold. The exact lowenergy landscapes for the trp cage protein (1L2Y) is presented showing the connectivity of all states and energy barriers.
q-bio.BM:The effective DNA-DNA interaction force is calculated by computer simulations with explicit tetravalent counterions and monovalent salt. For overcharged DNA molecules, the interaction force shows a double-minimum structure. The positions and depths of these minima are regulated by the counterion density in the bulk. Using two-dimensional lattice sum and free energy perturbation theories, the coexisting phases for DNA bundles are calculated. A DNA-condensation and redissolution transition and a stable mesocrystal with an intermediate lattice constant for high counterion concentration are obtained.
q-bio.BM:By using a mixture model for the density distribution of the three pseudobond angles formed by $C_\alpha$ atoms of four consecutive residues, the local structural states are discretized as 17 conformational letters of a protein structural alphabet. This coarse-graining procedure converts a 3D structure to a 1D code sequence. A substitution matrix between these letters is constructed based on the structural alignments of the FSSP database.
q-bio.BM:An overview of theories related to vibrational energy relaxation (VER) in proteins is presented. VER of a selected mode in cytochrome c is studied using two theoretical approaches. One is the equilibrium simulation approach with quantum correction factors, and the other is the reduced model approach which describes the protein as an ensemble of normal modes interacting through nonlinear coupling elements. Both methods result in estimates of the VER time (sub ps) for a CD stretching mode in the protein at room temperature. The theoretical predictions are in accord with the experimental data of Romesberg's group. A perspective on future directions for the detailed study of time scales and mechanisms for VER in proteins is presented.
q-bio.BM:Protein one-dimensional (1D) structures such as secondary structure and contact number provide intuitive pictures to understand how the native three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein is encoded in the amino acid sequence. However, it has not been clear whether a given set of 1D structures contains sufficient information for recovering the underlying 3D structure. Here we show that the 3D structure of a protein can be recovered from a set of three types of 1D structures, namely, secondary structure, contact number and residue-wise contact order which is introduced here for the first time. Using simulated annealing molecular dynamics simulations, the structures satisfying the given native 1D structural restraints were sought for 16 proteins of various structural classes and of sizes ranging from 56 to 146 residues. By selecting the structures best satisfying the restraints, all the proteins showed a coordinate RMS deviation of less than 4\AA{} from the native structure, and for most of them, the deviation was even less than 2\AA{}. The present result opens a new possibility to protein structure prediction and our understanding of the sequence-structure relationship.
q-bio.BM:The lack of specificity in microarray experiments due to non-specific hybridization raises a serious problem for the analysis of microarray data because the residual chemical background intensity is not related to the expression degree of the gene of interest. We analyzed the concentration dependence of the signal intensity of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes in terms using a microscopic binding model using a combination of mean hybridization isotherms and single base related affinity terms. The signal intensities of the PM and MM probes and their difference are assessed with regard to their sensitivity, specificity and resolution for gene expression measures. The presented theory implies the refinement of existing algorithms of probe level analysis to correct microarray data for non-specific background intensities.
q-bio.BM:Residue-wise contact order (RWCO) is a new kind of one-dimensional protein structures which represents the extent of long-range contacts. We have recently shown that a set of three types of one-dimensional structures (secondary structure, contact number, and RWCO) contains sufficient information for reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Currently, there exist prediction methods for secondary structure and contact number from amino acid sequence, but none exists for RWCO. Also, the properties of amino acids that affect RWCO is not clearly understood. Here, we present a linear regression-based method to predict RWCO from amino acid sequence, and analyze the regression parameters to identify the properties that correlates with the RWCO. The present method achieves the significant correlation of 0.59 between the native and predicted RWCOs on average. An unusual feature of the RWCO prediction is the remarkably large optimal half window size of 26 residues. The regression parameters for the central and near-central residues of the local sequence segment highly correlate with those of the contact number prediction, and hence with hydrophobicity.
q-bio.BM:In this paper the heat signaling in microtubules (MT) is investigated. It is argued that for the description of the heat signaling phenomena in MT, the hyperbolic heat transport (HHT) equation must be used. It is shown that HHT is the Klein-Gordon (K-G) equation. The general solution for the K-G equation for MT is obtained. For the undistorted signal propagation in MT the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is formulated and discussed.   Key words: Microtubules; Heat signaling; Klein-Gordon equation; Heisenberg principle.
q-bio.BM:In the last years, tens of thousands gene expression profiles for cells of several organisms have been monitored. Gene expression is a complex transcriptional process where mRNA molecules are translated into proteins, which control most of the cell functions. In this process, the correlation among genes is crucial to determine the specific functions of genes. Here, we propose a novel multi-dimensional stochastic approach to deal with the gene correlation phenomena. Interestingly, our stochastic framework suggests that the study of the gene correlation requires only one theoretical assumption -Markov property- and the experimental transition probability, which characterizes the gene correlation system. Finally, a gene expression experiment is proposed for future applications of the model.
q-bio.BM:The importance of understanding the mechanism of protein aggregation into insoluble amyloid fibrils relies not only on its medical consequences, but also on its more basic properties of self--organization. The discovery that a large number of uncorrelated proteins can form, under proper conditions, structurally similar fibrils has suggested that the underlying mechanism is a general feature of polypeptide chains. In the present work, we address the early events preceeding amyloid fibril formation in solutions of zinc--free human insulin incubated at low pH and high temperature. Aside from being a easy--to--handle model for protein fibrillation, subcutaneous aggregation of insulin after injection is a nuisance which affects patients with diabetes. Here, we show by time--lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) that a steady-state distribution of protein oligomers with an exponential tail is reached within few minutes after heating. This metastable phase lasts for few hours until aggregation into fibrils suddenly occurs. A theoretical explanation of the oligomer pre--fibrillar distribution is given in terms of a simple coagulation--evaporation kinetic model, in which concentration plays the role of a critical parameter. Due to high resolution and sensitivity of AFM technique, the observation of a long-lasting latency time should be considered an actual feature of the aggregation process, and not simply ascribed to instrumental inefficency. These experimental facts, along with the kinetic model used, claim for a critical role of thermal concentration fluctuations in the process of fibril nucleation.
q-bio.BM:Identical objects, regularly assembled, form a helix, which is the principal motif of nucleic acids, proteins, and viral capsids.
q-bio.BM:The ambitious and ultimate research purpose in Systems Biology is the understanding and modelling of the cell's system. Although a vast number of models have been developed in order to extract biological knowledge from complex systems composed of basic elements as proteins, genes and chemical compounds, a need remains for improving our understanding of dynamical features of the systems (i.e., temporal-dependence).   In this article, we analyze the gene expression dynamics (i.e., how the genes expression fluctuates in time) by using a new constructive approach. This approach is based on only two fundamental ingredients: symmetry and the Markov property of dynamics. First, by using experimental data of human and yeast gene expression time series, we found a symmetry in short-time transition probability from time $t$ to time $t+1$. We call it self-similarity symmetry (i.e., surprisingly, the gene expression short-time fluctuations contain a repeating pattern of smaller and smaller parts that are like the whole, but different in size). Secondly, the Markov property of dynamics reflects that the short-time fluctuation governs the full-time behaviour of the system. Here, we succeed in reconstructing naturally the global behavior of the observed distribution of gene expression (i.e., scaling-law) and the local behaviour of the power-law tail of this distribution, by using only these two ingredients: symmetry and the Markov property of dynamics. This approach may represent a step forward toward an integrated image of the basic elements of the whole cell.
q-bio.BM:In this work, the dynamics of fluctuations in gene expression time series is investigated. By using collected data of gene expression from yeast and human organisms, we found that the fluctuations of gene expression level and its average value over time are strongly correlated and obey a scaling law. As this feature is found in yeast and human organisms, it suggests that probably this coupling is a common dynamical organizing property of all living systems. To understand these observations, we propose a stochastic model which can explain these collective fluctuations, and predict the scaling exponent. Interestingly, our results indicate that the observed scaling law emerges from the self-similarity symmetry embedded in gene expression fluctuations.
q-bio.BM:We study the mechanism underlying the attraction between nucleosomes, the fundamental packaging units of DNA inside the chromatin complex. We introduce a simple model of the nucleosome, the eight-tail colloid, consisting of a charged sphere with eight oppositely charged, flexible, grafted chains that represent the terminal histone tails. We demonstrate that our complexes are attracted via the formation of chain bridges and that this attraction can be tuned by changing the fraction of charged monomers on the tails. This suggests a physical mechanism of chromatin compaction where the degree of DNA condensation can be controlled via biochemical means, namely the acetylation and deacetylation of lysines in the histone tails.
q-bio.BM:The effects of monovalent (Na+, K+) and divalent (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+) ions on the interaction between DNA and histone are studied using the molecular combing technique. Lamda-DNA molecules and DNA-histone complexes incubated with metal cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+) are stretched on hydrophobic surfaces, and directly observed by fluorescence microscopy. The results indicate that when these cations are added into the DNA solution, the fluorescence intensities of the stained DNA are reduced differently. The monovalent cations (Na+, K+) inhibit binding of histone to DNA. The divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+) enhance significantly the binding of histone to DNA and the binding of the DNA-histone complex to the hydrophobic surface. Mn2+ also induces condensation and aggregation of the DNA-histone complex.
q-bio.BM:PDZ (Post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1) domains are relatively small (80 to 120 residues) protein binding modules central in the organization of receptor clusters and in the association of cellular proteins. Their main function is to bind C-terminals of selected proteins that are recognized through specific amino-acids in their carboxyl end. Binding is associated with a deformation of the PDZ native structure and is responsible for dynamical changes in regions not in direct contact with the target. We investigate how this deformation is related to the harmonic dynamics of the PDZ structure and show that one low-frequency collective normal mode, characterized by the concerted movements of different secondary structures, is involved in the binding process. Our results suggest that even minimal structural changes are responsible of communication between distant regions of the protein, in agreement with recent Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments. Thus PDZ domains are a very clear example of how collective normal modes are able to characterize the relation between function and dynamics of proteins, and to provide indications on the precursors of binding/unbonding events.
q-bio.BM:We introduce a new measure of antigenic distance between influenza A vaccine and circulating strains. The measure correlates well with efficacies of the H3N2 influenza A component of the annual vaccine between 1971 and 2004, as do results of a theory of the immune response to influenza following vaccination. This new measure of antigenic distance is correlated with vaccine efficacy to a greater degree than are current state-of-the-art phylogenetic sequence analyzes or ferret antisera inhibition assays. We suggest that this new measure of antigenic distance be used in the design of the annual influenza vaccine and in the interpretation of vaccine efficacy monitoring.
q-bio.BM:Prediction of one-dimensional protein structures such as secondary structures and contact numbers is useful for the three-dimensional structure prediction and important for the understanding of sequence-structure relationship. Here we present a new machine-learning method, critical random networks (CRNs), for predicting one-dimensional structures, and apply it, with position-specific scoring matrices, to the prediction of secondary structures (SS), contact numbers (CN), and residue-wise contact orders (RWCO). The present method achieves, on average, $Q_3$ accuracy of 77.8% for SS, correlation coefficients of 0.726 and 0.601 for CN and RWCO, respectively. The accuracy of the SS prediction is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, and that of the CN prediction is a significant improvement over previous methods. We give a detailed formulation of critical random networks-based prediction scheme, and examine the context-dependence of prediction accuracies. In order to study the nonlinear and multi-body effects, we compare the CRNs-based method with a purely linear method based on position-specific scoring matrices. Although not superior to the CRNs-based method, the surprisingly good accuracy achieved by the linear method highlights the difficulty in extracting structural features of higher order from amino acid sequence beyond that provided by the position-specific scoring matrices.
q-bio.BM:We describe the results obtained from an improved model for protein folding. We find that a good agreement with the native structure of a 46 residue long, five-letter protein segment is obtained by carefully tuning the parameters of the self-avoiding energy. In particular we find an improved free-energy profile. We also compare the efficiency of the multidimensional replica exchange method with the widely used parallel tempering.
q-bio.BM:We use single-particle tracking to study the elastic properties of single microtubules grafted to a substrate. Thermal fluctuations of the free microtubule's end are recorded, in order to measure position distribution functions from which we calculate the persistence length of microtubules with contour lengths between 2.6 and 48 micrometers. We find the persistence length to vary by more than a factor of 20 over the total range of contour lengths. Our results support the hypothesis that shearing between protofilaments contributes significantly to the mechanics of microtubules.
q-bio.BM:Optimal structure of proteins is described by linear stochastic differential equation with mean decrease of free energy and volatility. Structure determining strategy is given by a twin of stochastic variables for which empirical conditions are not postulated. Optimal structure determination will be deformed to be adoptive to trading strategy employing martingale property where stochastic integral w.r.t. analytical solution of stochastic differential equation will be employed.
q-bio.BM:One of the main problems of drug design is that of optimizing the drug--target interaction. In the case in which the target is a viral protein displaying a high mutation rate, a second problem arises, namely the eventual development of resistance. We wish to suggest a scheme for the design of non--conventional drugs which do not face any of these problems and apply it to the case of HIV--1 protease. It is based on the knowledge that the folding of single--domain proteins, like e.g. each of the monomers forming the HIV--1--PR homodimer, is controlled by local elementary structures (LES), stabilized by local contacts among hydrophobic, strongly interacting and highly conserved amino acids which play a central role in the folding process. Because LES have evolved over myriads of generations to recognize and strongly interact with each other so as to make the protein fold fast as well as to avoid aggregation with other proteins, highly specific (and thus little toxic) as well as effective folding--inhibitor drugs suggest themselves: short peptides (or eventually their mimetic molecules), displaying the same amino acid sequence of that of LES (p--LES). Aside from being specific and efficient, these inhibitors are expected not to induce resistance: in fact, mutations which successfully avoid their action imply the destabilization of one or more LES and thus should lead to protein denaturation. Making use of Monte Carlo simulations within the framework of a simple although not oversimplified model, which is able to reproduce the main thermodynamic as well as dynamic properties of monoglobular proteins, we first identify the LES of the HIV--1--PR and then show that the corresponding p--LES peptides act as effective inhibitors of the folding of the protease which do not create resistance.
q-bio.BM:Protein structure is generally conceptualized as the global arrangement or of smaller, local motifs of helices, sheets, and loops. These regular, recurring secondary structural elements have well-understood and standardized definitions in terms of amino acid backbone geometry and the manner in which hydrogen bonding requirements are satisfied. Recently, "tube" models have been proposed to explain protein secondary structure in terms of the geometrically optimal packing of a featureless cylinder. However, atomically detailed simulations demonstrate that such packing considerations alone are insufficient for defining secondary structure; both excluded volume and hydrogen bonding must be explicitly modeled for helix formation. These results have fundamental implications for the construction and interpretation of realistic and meaningful biomacromolecular models.
q-bio.BM:Structure predictions of helical membrane proteins have been designed to take advantage of the structural autonomy of secondary structure elements, as postulated by the two-stage model of Engelman and Popot. In this context, we investigate structure calculation strategies for two membrane proteins with different functions, sizes, aminoacid compositions, and topologies: the glycophorin A homodimer (a paradigm for close inter-helical packing in membrane proteins) and aquaporin (a channel protein). Our structure calculations are based on two alternative folding schemes: a one-step simulated annealing from an extended chain conformation, and a two-step procedure inspired by the grid-search methods traditionally used in membrane protein predictions. In this framework, we investigate rationales for the utilization of sparse NMR data such as distance-based restraints and residual dipolar couplings in structure calculations of helical membrane proteins.
q-bio.BM:Proteins created by combinatorial methods in vitro are an important source of information for understanding sequence-structure-function relationships. Alignments of folded proteins from combinatorial libraries can be analyzed using methods developed for naturally occurring proteins, but this neglects the information contained in the unfolded sequences of the library. We introduce two algorithms, logistic regression and excess information analysis, that use both the folded and unfolded sequences and compare them against contingency table and statistical coupling analysis, which only use the former. The test set for this benchmark study is a library of fictitious proteins that fold according to a hypothetical energy model. Of the four methods studied, only logistic regression is able to correctly recapitulate the energy model from the sequence alignment. The other algorithms predict spurious interactions between alignment positions with strong but individual influences on protein stability. When present in the same protein, stabilizing amino acids tend to lower the energy below the threshold needed for folding. As a result, their frequencies in the alignment can be correlated even if the positions do not interact. We believe any algorithm that neglects the nonlinear relationship between folding and energy is susceptible to this error.
q-bio.BM:In order to extend the results obtained with minimal lattice models to more realistic systems, we study a model where proteins are described as a chain of 20 kinds of structureless amino acids moving in a continuum space and interacting through a contact potential controlled by a 20x20 quenched random matrix. The goal of the present work is to design and characterize amino acid sequences folding to the SH3 conformation, a 60-residues recognition domain common to many regulatory proteins. We show that a number of sequences can fold, starting from a random conformation, to within a distance root mean square deviation (dRMSD) of 2.6A from the native state. Good folders are those sequences displaying in the native conformation an energy lower than a sequence--independent threshold energy.
q-bio.BM:We recently introduced a physical model [Hoang et al., P. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2004), Banavar et al., Phys. Rev. E (2004)] for proteins which incorporates, in an approximate manner, several key features such as the inherent anisotropy of a chain molecule, the geometrical and energetic constraints placed by the hydrogen bonds and sterics, and the role played by hydrophobicity. Within this framework, marginally compact conformations resembling the native state folds of proteins emerge as broad competing minima in the free energy landscape even for a homopolymer. Here we show how the introduction of sequence heterogeneity using a simple scheme of just two types of amino acids, hydrophobic (H) and polar (P), and sequence design allows a selected putative native fold to become the free energy minimum at low temperature. The folding transition exhibits thermodynamic cooperativity, if one neglects the degeneracy between two different low energy conformations sharing the same fold topology.
q-bio.BM:In eukaryote nucleosome, DNA wraps around a histone octamer in a left-handed way. We study the process of chirality formation of nucleosome with Brownian dynamics simulation. We model the histone octamer with a quantitatively adjustable chirality: left-handed, right-handed or non-chiral, and simulate the dynamical wrapping process of a DNA molecule on it. We find that the chirality of a nucleosome formed is strongly dependent on that of the histone octamer, and different chiralities of the histone octamer induce its different rotation directions in the wrapping process of DNA. In addition, a very weak chirality of the histone octamer is quite enough for sustaining the correct chirality of the nucleosome formed. We also show that the chirality of a nucleosome may be broken at elevated temperature.
q-bio.BM:Trypsin and chymotrypsin are both serine proteases with high sequence and structural similarities, but with different substrate specificity. Previous experiments have demonstrated the critical role of the two loops outside the binding pocket in controlling the specificity of the two enzymes. To understand the mechanism of such a control of specificity by distant loops, we have used the Gaussian Network Model to study the dynamic properties of trypsin and chymotrypsin and the roles played by the two loops. A clustering method was introduced to analyze the correlated motions of residues. We have found that trypsin and chymotrypsin have distinct dynamic signatures in the two loop regions which are in turn highly correlated with motions of certain residues in the binding pockets. Interestingly, replacing the two loops of trypsin with those of chymotrypsin changes the motion style of trypsin to chymotrypsin-like, whereas the same experimental replacement was shown necessary to make trypsin have chymotrypsin's enzyme specificity and activity. These results suggest that the cooperative motions of the two loops and the substrate-binding sites contribute to the activity and substrate specificity of trypsin and chymotrypsin.
q-bio.BM:The emergence and spreading of chirality on the early Earth is considered by studying a set of reaction-diffusion equations based on a polymerization model. It is found that effective mixing of the early oceans is necessary to reach the present homochiral state. The possibility of introducing mass extinctions and modifying the emergence rate of life is discussed.
q-bio.BM:The differences between uni-directional and bi-directional polymerization are considered. The uni-directional case is discussed in the framework of the RNA world. Similar to earlier models of this type, where polymerization was assumed to proceed in a bi-directional fashion (presumed to be relevant to peptide nucleic acids), left-handed and right-handed monomers are produced via an autocatalysis from an achiral substrate. The details of the bifurcation from a racemic solution to a homochiral state of either handedness is shown to be remarkably independent of whether the polymerization in uni-directional or bi-directional. Slightly larger differences are seen when dissociation is allowed and the dissociation fragments are being recycled into the achiral substrate.
q-bio.BM:A variety of viruses tightly pack their genetic material into protein capsids that are barely large enough to enclose the genome. In particular, in bacteriophages, forces as high as 60 pN are encountered during packaging and ejection, produced by DNA bending elasticity and self-interactions. The high forces are believed to be important for the ejection process, though the extent of their involvement is not yet clear. As a result, there is a need for quantitative models and experiments that reveal the nature of the forces relevant to DNA ejection. Here we report measurements of the ejection forces for two different mutants of bacteriophage lambda, lambda b221cI26 and lambda cI60, which differ in genome length by ~30%. As expected for a force-driven ejection mechanism, the osmotic pressure at which DNA release is completely inhibited varies with the genome length: we find inhibition pressures of 15 atm and 25 atm, respectively, values that are in agreement with our theoretical calculations.
q-bio.BM:The correlations of primary and secondary structures were analyzed using proteins with known structure from Protein Data Bank. The correlation values of amino acid type and the eight secondary structure types at distant position were calculated for distances between -25 and 25. Shapes of the diagrams indicate that amino acids polarity and capability for hydrogen bonding have influence on the secondary structure at some distances. Clear preference of most of the amino acids towards certain secondary structure type classifies amino acids into four groups: alpha-helix admirers, strand admirers, turn and bend admirers and the others. Group four consists of His and Cis, the amino acids that do not show clear preference for any secondary structure. Amino acids from a group have similar physicochemical properties, and the same structural characteristics. The results suggest that amino acid preference for secondary structure type is based on the structural characteristics at Cb and Cg atoms of amino acid. alpha-helix admirers do not have polar heteroatoms on Cb and Cg atoms, nor branching or aromatic group on Cb atom. Amino acids that have aromatic groups or branching on Cb atom are strand admirers. Turn and bend admirers have polar heteroatom on Cb or Cg atoms or do not have Cb atom at all. Our results indicate that polarity and capability for hydrogen bonding have influence on the secondary structure at some distance, and that amino acid preference for secondary structure is caused by structural properties at Cb or Cg atoms.
q-bio.BM:The functionality of proteins is related to their structure in the native state. Protein structures are made up of emergent building blocks of helices and almost planar sheets. A simple coarse-grained geometrical model of a flexible tube barely subject to compaction provides a unified framework for understanding the common character of globular proteins.We argue that a recent critique of the tube idea is not well founded.
q-bio.BM:To gain a deeper insight into cellular processes such as transcription and translation, one needs to uncover the mechanisms controlling the configurational changes of nucleic acids. As a step toward this aim, we present here a novel mesoscopic-level computational model that provides a new window into nucleic acid dynamics. We model a single-stranded nucleic as a polymer chain whose monomers are the nucleosides. Each monomer comprises a bead representing the sugar molecule and a pin representing the base. The bead-pin complex can rotate about the backbone of the chain. We consider pairwise stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions. We use a modified Monte Carlo dynamics that splits the dynamics into translational bead motion and rotational pin motion. By performing a number of tests we first show that our model is physically sound. We then focus on the study of a the kinetics of a DNA hairpin--a single-stranded molecule comprising two complementary segments joined by a non-complementary loop--studied experimentally. We find that results from our simulations agree with experimental observations, demonstrating that our model is a suitable tool for the investigation of the hybridization of single strands.
q-bio.BM:We investigate the folding behavior of protein sequences by numerically studying all sequences with maximally compact lattice model through exhaustive enumeration. We get the prion-like behavior of protein folding. Individual proteins remaining stable in the isolated native state may change their conformations when they aggregate. We observe the folding properties as the interfacial interaction strength changes, and find that the strength must be strong enough before the propagation of the most stable structures happens.
q-bio.BM:We review some of our recent results obtained within the scope of simple lattice models and Monte Carlo simulations that illustrate the role of native geometry in the folding kinetics of two state folders.
q-bio.BM:Ion channels are proteins with a hole down the middle embedded in cell membranes. Membranes form insulating structures and the channels through them allow and control the movement of charged particles, spherical ions, mostly Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl-. Membranes contain hundreds or thousands of types of channels, fluctuating between open conducting, and closed insulating states. Channels control an enormous range of biological function by opening and closing in response to specific stimuli using mechanisms that are not yet understood in physical language. Open channels conduct current of charged particles following laws of Brownian movement of charged spheres rather like the laws of electrodiffusion of quasi-particles in semiconductors. Open channels select between similar ions using a combination of electrostatic and 'crowded charge' (Lennard-Jones) forces. The specific location of atoms and the exact atomic structure of the channel protein seems much less important than certain properties of the structure, namely the volume accessible to ions and the effective density of fixed and polarization charge. There is no sign of other chemical effects like delocalization of electron orbitals between ions and the channel protein. Channels play a role in biology as important as transistors in computers, and they use rather similar physics to perform part of that role. Understanding their fluctuations awaits physical insight into the source of the variance and mathematical analysis of the coupling of the fluctuations to the other components and forces of the system.
q-bio.BM:We propose a criterion for optimal parameter selection in coarse-grained models of proteins, and develop a refined elastic network model (ENM) of bovine trypsinogen. The unimodal density-of-states distribution of the trypsinogen ENM disagrees with the bimodal distribution obtained from an all-atom model; however, the bimodal distribution is recovered by strengthening interactions between atoms that are backbone neighbors. We use the backbone-enhanced model to analyze allosteric mechanisms of trypsinogen, and find relatively strong communication between the regulatory and active sites.
q-bio.BM:The protonation of N2 bound to the active center of nitrogenase has been investigated using state-of-the-art DFT calculations. Dinitrogen in the bridging mode is activated by forming two bonds to Fe sites, which results in a reduction of the energy for the first hydrogen transfer by 123 kJ/mol. The axial binding mode with open sulfur bridge is less reactive by 30 kJ/mol and the energetic ordering of the axial and bridged binding mode is reversed in favor of the bridging dinitrogen during the first protonation. Protonation of the central ligand is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically hindered. If the central ligand is protonated, the proton is transferred to dinitrogen following the second protonation. Protonation of dinitrogen at the Mo site does not lead to low-energy intermediates.
q-bio.BM:The ejection of DNA from a bacterial virus (``phage'') into its host cell is a biologically important example of the translocation of a macromolecular chain along its length through a membrane. The simplest mechanism for this motion is diffusion, but in the case of phage ejection a significant driving force derives from the high degree of stress to which the DNA is subjected in the viral capsid. The translocation is further sped up by the ratcheting and entropic forces associated with proteins that bind to the viral DNA in the host cell cytoplasm. We formulate a generalized diffusion equation that includes these various pushing and pulling effects and make estimates of the corresponding speed-ups in the overall translocation process. Stress in the capsid is the dominant factor throughout early ejection, with the pull due to binding particles taking over at later stages. Confinement effects are also investigated, in the case where the phage injects its DNA into a volume comparable to the capsid size. Our results suggest a series of in vitro experiments involving the ejection of DNA into vesicles filled with varying amounts of binding proteins from phage whose state of stress is controlled by ambient salt conditions or by tuning genome length.
q-bio.BM:We present a base-pairing model of oligonuleotide duplex formation and show in detail its equivalence to the Nearest-Neighbour dimer methods from fits to free energy of duplex formation data for short DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA hybrids containing only Watson Crick pairs. In this approach the connection between rank-deficient polymer and rank-determinant oligonucleotide parameter, sets for DNA duplexes is transparent. The method is generalised to include RNA/DNA hybrids where the rank-deficient model with 11 dimer parameters in fact provides marginally improved predictions relative to the standard method with 16 independent dimer parameters ($\Delta G$ mean errors of 4.5 and 5.4 % respectively).
q-bio.BM:A formalism is developed which allows to determine the locations of all local symmetry axes of three-dimensional particles with overall icosahedral symmetry. It relies on the fact that the root system of the non-crystallographic Coxeter group H_3 encodes the locations of the planes of reflection that generate the discrete rotational symmetries of the particles. Via an appropriate extension of the root system, new planes of reflection are introduced which determine local axes of rotational symmetry. An easy-to-implement formalism is derived that allows to compute the surface structure of any three-dimensional icosahedral particle with local symmetries. It can be used also for particles with overall octahedral and tetrahedral symmetry in conjunction with the root systems of the corresponding reflection groups.   Applications to viruses are discussed explicitly. It is shown that the concept of quasi-equivalence in Caspar-Klug Theory corresponds to the special case of local six-fold symmetry axes contained in the theory developed here, and the corresponding geometries can hence be obtained with this formalism based on the root system of H_3.   Moreover, as a by-product, the theory answers the long-standing open question why only certain types of capsomeres, i.e. clusters of protein subunits, are observed in the surface structures of viruses. Since the types of the capsomeres are determined by the orders of the local symmetry axes on which they are located, the possible types of capsomeres are restricted by the spectrum of local symmetry axes allowed by the theory. Based on this we determine the spectrum of all capsomere types that may occur in viral capsids and give explicit examples for the lower-order cases.
q-bio.BM:The tethered-particle method is a single-molecule technique that has been used to explore the dynamics of a variety of macromolecules of biological interest. We give a theoretical analysis of the particle motions in such experiments. Our analysis reveals that the proximity of the tethered bead to a nearby surface (the microscope slide) gives rise to a volume-exclusion effect, resulting in an entropic force on the molecule. This force stretches the molecule, changing its statistical properties. In particular, the proximity of bead and surface brings about intriguing scaling relations between key observables (statistical moments of the bead) and parameters such as the bead size and contour length of the molecule. We present both approximate analytic solutions and numerical results for these effects in both flexible and semiflexible tethers. Finally, our results give a precise, experimentally-testable prediction for the probability distribution of the distance between the polymer attachment point and the center of the mobile bead.
q-bio.BM:The distribution of inequivalent geometries occurring during self-assembly of the major capsid protein in thermodynamic equilibrium is determined based on a master equation approach. These results are implemented to characterize the assembly of SV40 virus and to obtain information on the putative pathways controlling the progressive build-up of the SV40 capsid. The experimental testability of the predictions is assessed and an analysis of the geometries of the assembly intermediates on the dominant pathways is used to identify targets for antiviral drug design.
q-bio.BM:A vital constituent of a virus is its protein shell, called the viral capsid, that encapsulates and hence provides protection for the viral genome. Assembly models are developed for viral capsids built from protein building blocks that can assume different local bonding structures in the capsid. This situation occurs, for example, for viruses in the family of Papovaviridae, which are linked to cancer and are hence of particular interest for the health sector. More specifically, the viral capsids of the (pseudo-) T=7 particles in this family consist of pentamers that exhibit two different types of bonding structures. While this scenario cannot be described mathematically in terms of Caspar-Klug Theory (Caspar and Klug 1962), it can be modelled via tiling theory (Twarock 2004). The latter is used to encode the local bonding environment of the building blocks in a combinatorial structure, called the assembly tree, which is a basic ingredient in the derivation of assembly models for Papovaviridae along the lines of the equilibrium approach of Zlotnick (Zlotnick 1994). A phase space formalism is introduced to characterize the changes in the assembly pathways and intermediates triggered by the variations in the association energies characterizing the bonds between the building blocks in the capsid. Furthermore, the assembly pathways and concentrations of the statistically dominant assembly intermediates are determined. The example of Simian Virus 40 is discussed in detail.
q-bio.BM:We calculate the equation of state of DNA under tension for the case that the DNA features loops. Such loops occur transiently during DNA condensation in the presence of multivalent ions or sliding cationic protein linkers. The force-extension relation of such looped DNA modelled as a wormlike chain is calculated via path integration in the semiclassical limit. This allows us to determine rigorously the high stretching asymptotics. Notably the functional form of the force-extension curve resembles that of straight DNA, yet with a strongly renormalized apparent persistence length. That means that the experimentally extracted single molecule elasticity does not necessarily reflect the bare DNA stiffness only, but can also contain additional contributions that depend on the overall chain conformation and length.
q-bio.BM:A generalized computational method for folding proteins with a fully transferable potential and geometrically realistic all-atom model is presented and tested on seven different helix bundle proteins. The protocol, which includes graph-theoretical analysis of the ensemble of resulting folded conformations, was systematically applied and consistently produced structure predictions of approximately 3 Angstroms without any knowledge of the native state. To measure and understand the significance of the results, extensive control simulations were conducted. Graph theoretic analysis provides a means for systematically identifying the native fold and provides physical insight, conceptually linking the results to modern theoretical views of protein folding. In addition to presenting a method for prediction of structure and folding mechanism, our model suggests that a accurate all-atom amino acid representation coupled with a physically reasonable atomic interaction potential (that does not require optimization to the test set) and hydrogen bonding are essential features for a realistic protein model.
q-bio.BM:Being the HIV-1 Protease (HIV-1-PR) an essential enzyme in the viral life cycle, its inhibition can control AIDS. The folding of single domain proteins, like each of the monomers forming the HIV-1-PR homodimer, is controlled by local elementary structures (LES, folding units stabilized by strongly interacting, highly conserved, as a rule hydrophobic, amino acids). These LES have evolved over myriad of generations to recognize and strongly attract each other, so as to make the protein fold fast and be stable in its native conformation. Consequently, peptides displaying a sequence identical to those segments of the monomers associated with LES are expected to act as competitive inhibitors and thus destabilize the native structure of the enzyme. These inhibitors are unlikely to lead to escape mutants as they bind to the protease monomers through highly conserved amino acids which play an essential role in the folding process. The properties of one of the most promising inhibitors of the folding of the HIV-1-PR monomers found among these peptides is demonstrated with the help of spectrophotometric assays and CD spectroscopy.
q-bio.BM:It is shown that a small subset of modes which are likely to be involved in protein functional motions of large amplitude can be determined by retaining the most robust normal modes obtained using different protein models. This result should prove helpful in the context of several applications proposed recently, like for solving difficult molecular replacement problems or for fitting atomic structures into low-resolution electron density maps. Moreover, it may also pave the way for the development of methods allowing to predict such motions accurately.
q-bio.BM:A new formalism for calculation of the partition function of single stranded nucleic acids is presented. Secondary structures and the topology of structure elements are the level of resolution that is used. The folding model deals with matches, mismatches, symmetric and asymmetric interior loops, stacked pairs in loop and dangling end regions, multi-branched loops, bulges and single base stacking that might exist at duplex ends or at the ends of helices. Calculations on short and long sequences show, that for short oligonucleotides, a duplex formation often displays a two-state transition. However, for longer oligonucleotides, the thermodynamic properties of the single self-folding transition affects the transition nature of the duplex formation, resulting in a population of intermediate hairpin species in the solution. The role of intermediate hairpin species is analyzed in the case when a short oligonucleotides (molecular beacons) have to reliably identify and hybridize to accessible nucleotides within their targeted mRNA sequences. It is shown that the enhanced specificity of the molecular beacons is a result of their constrained conformational flexibility and the all-or-none mechanism of their hybridization to the target sequence.
q-bio.BM:A vital constituent of a virus is its protein shell, called the viral capsid, that encapsulates and hence provides protection for the viral genome. Viral capsids are usually spherical, and for a significant number of viruses exhibit overall icosahedral symmetry. The corresponding surface lattices, that encode the locations of the capsid proteins and intersubunit bonds, can be modelled by Viral Tiling Theory.   It has been shown in vitro that under a variation of the experimental boundary conditions, such as the pH value and salt concentration, tubular particles may appear instead of, or in addition to, spherical ones. In order to develop models that describe the simultaneous assembly of both spherical and tubular variants, and hence study the possibility of triggering tubular malformations as a means of interference with the replication mechanism, Viral Tiling Theory has to be extended to include tubular lattices with end caps. This is done here for the case of Papovaviridae, which play a distinguished role from the viral structural point of view as they correspond to all pentamer lattices, i.e. lattices formed from clusters of five protein subunits throughout. These results pave the way for a generalisation of recently developed assembly models.
q-bio.BM:Experimental investigations of the biosynthesis of a number of proteins have pointed out that part of the native structure can be acquired already during translation. We carried out a comprehensive statistical analysis of some average structural properties of proteins that have been put forward as possible signatures of this progressive buildup process. Contrary to a widespread belief, it is found that there is no major propensity of the amino acids to form contacts with residues that are closer to the N terminus. Moreover, it is found that the C terminus is significantly more compact and locally-organized than the N one. Also this bias, though, is unlikely to be related to vectorial effects, since it correlates with subtle differences in the primary sequence. These findings indicate that even if proteins aquire their structure vectorially no signature of this seems to be detectable in their average structural properties.
q-bio.BM:The aim of this article is to present a developed method that decomposes the autofluorescence spectrum into the spectra of naturally occurring biochemical components of biotissue. It requires knowledge of detailed spectrum behaviour of different endogenous fluorophores. We have studied the main bio-markers in human tissue and proposed a simple modelling algorithm for their spectra shapes. The empirical method was tested theoretically by quantum-mechanical calculations of the spectra in the unharmonic Morse potential approach.
q-bio.BM:Experimental evidence suggests that the folding and aggregation of the amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) into oligomers is a key pathogenetic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting the pathologic folding and oligomerization of A$\beta$ could be effective in the prevention and treatment of AD. Here, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent, we probe the initial stages of folding of a decapeptide segment of A$\beta$, A$\beta_{21-30}$, shown experimentally to nucleate the folding process. In addition, we examine the folding of a homologous decapeptide containing an amino acid substitution linked to hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis--Dutch type, [Gln22]A$\beta_{21-30}$. We find that: (i) when the decapeptide is in water, hydrophobic interactions and transient salt bridges between Lys28 and either Glu22 or Asp23 are important in the formation of a loop in the Val24--Lys28 region of the wild type decapeptide; (ii) in the presence of salt ions, salt bridges play a more prominent role in the stabilization of the loop; (iii) in water with a reduced density, the decapeptide forms a helix, indicating the sensitivity of folding to different aqueous environments; (iv) the ``Dutch'' peptide in water, in contrast to the wild type peptide, fails to form a long-lived Val24--Lys28 loop, suggesting that loop stability is a critical factor in determining whether A$\beta$ folds into pathologic structures. Our results are relevant to understand the mechanism of A$\beta$ peptide folding in different environments, such as intra- and extracellular milieus or cell membranes, and how amino acid substitutions linked to familial forms of amyloidosis cause disease.

q-bio.BM:We develop a class of models with which we simulate the assembly of particles into T1 capsid-like objects using Newtonian dynamics. By simulating assembly for many different values of system parameters, we vary the forces that drive assembly. For some ranges of parameters, assembly is facile, while for others, assembly is dynamically frustrated by kinetic traps corresponding to malformed or incompletely formed capsids. Our simulations sample many independent trajectories at various capsomer concentrations, allowing for statistically meaningful conclusions. Depending on subunit (i.e., capsomer) geometries, successful assembly proceeds by several mechanisms involving binding of intermediates of various sizes. We discuss the relationship between these mechanisms and experimental evaluations of capsid assembly processes.
q-bio.BM:In this paper the heat transport in microtubules (MT) is investigated. When the dimension of the structure is of the order of the de Broglie wave length the transport phenomena must be analyzed within quantum mechanics. In this paper we developed the Dirac type thermal equation for MT .The solution of the equation-the temperature fields for electrons can be wave type or diffusion type depending on the dynamics of the scattering. Key words: Microtubules ultrashort laser pulses, Dirac thermal equation, temperature fields.
q-bio.BM:Mouse prion protein PrP106-126 is a peptide corresponding to the residues 107-127 of human prion protein. It has been shown that PrP106-126 can reproduce the main neuropathological features of prionrelated transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and can form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. The conformational characteristics of PrP106-126 fibril have been investigated by electron microscopy, CD spectroscopy, NMR and molecular dynamics simulations. Recent researches have found out that PrP106-126 in water assumes a stable structure consisting of two parallel beta-sheets that are tightly packed against each other. In this work we perform molecular dynamics simulation to reveal the elongation mechanism of PrP106-126 fibril. Influenced by the edge strands of the fibril which already adopt beta-sheets conformation, single PrP106-126 peptide forms beta-structure and becomes a new element of the fibril. Under acidic condition, single PrP106-126 peptide adopts a much larger variety of conformations than it does under neural condition, which makes a peptide easier to be influenced by the edge strands of the fibril. However, acidic condition dose not largely affect the stability of PrP106-126 peptide fibril. Thus, the speed of fibril elongation can be dramatically increased by lowering the pH value of the solution. The pH value was adjusted by either changing the protonation state of the residues or adding hydronium ions (acidic solution) or hydroxyl ions (alkaline solution). The differences between these two approaches are analyzed here.
q-bio.BM:The thermodynamics of the small SH3 protein domain is studied by means of a simplified model where each bead-like amino acid interacts with the others through a contact potential controlled by a 20x20 random matrix. Good folding sequences, characterized by a low native energy, display three main thermodynamical phases, namely a coil-like phase, an unfolded globule and a folded phase (plus other two phases, namely frozen and random coil, populated only at extremes temperatures). Interestingly, the unfolded globule has some regions already structured. Poorly designed sequences, on the other hand, display a wide transition from the random coil to a frozen state. The comparison with the analytic theory of heteropolymers is discussed.
q-bio.BM:In a seminal paper Caspar and Klug established a theory that provides a family of polyhedra as blueprints for the structural organisation of viral capsids. In particular, they encode the locations of the proteins in the shells that encapsulate, and hence provide protection for, the viral genome. Despite of its huge success and numerous applications in virology experimental results have provided evidence for the fact that the theory is too restrictive to describe all known viruses. Especially, the family of Papovaviridae, which contains cancer-causing viruses, falls out of the scope of this theory.   In a recent paper we have shown that certain members of the family of Papovaviridae can be described via tilings. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical framework for the derivation of all surface structures of viral particles in this family. We show that this formalism fixes the structure and relative sizes of all particles collectively so that there exists only one scaling factor that relates the sizes of all particles with their biological counterparts.   The series of polyhedra derived here complements the Caspar-Klug family of polyhedra. It is the first mathematical result that provides a common organisational principle for different types of viral particles in the family of Papovaviridae and paves the way for an understanding of Papovaviridae polymorphism. Moreover, it provides crucial input for the construction of assembly models.
q-bio.BM:The amino acid sequences of proteins provide rich information for inferring distant phylogenetic relationships and for predicting protein functions. Estimating the rate matrix of residue substitutions from amino acid sequences is also important because the rate matrix can be used to develop scoring matrices for sequence alignment. Here we use a continuous time Markov process to model the substitution rates of residues and develop a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for rate estimation. We validate our method using simulated artificial protein sequences. Because different local regions such as binding surfaces and the protein interior core experience different selection pressures due to functional or stability constraints, we use our method to estimate the substitution rates of local regions. Our results show that the substitution rates are very different for residues in the buried core and residues on the solvent exposed surfaces. In addition, the rest of the proteins on the binding surfaces also have very different substitution rates from residues. Based on these findings, we further develop a method for protein function prediction by surface matching using scoring matrices derived from estimated substitution rates for residues located on the binding surfaces. We show with examples that our method is effective in identifying functionally related proteins that have overall low sequence identity, a task known to be very challenging.
q-bio.BM:This chapter discusses geometric models of biomolecules and geometric constructs, including the union of ball model, the weigthed Voronoi diagram, the weighted Delaunay triangulation, and the alpha shapes. These geometric constructs enable fast and analytical computaton of shapes of biomoleculres (including features such as voids and pockets) and metric properties (such as area and volume). The algorithms of Delaunay triangulation, computation of voids and pockets, as well volume/area computation are also described. In addition, applications in packing analysis of protein structures and protein function prediction are also discussed.
q-bio.BM:This chapter discusses theoretical framework and methods for developing knowledge-based potential functions essential for protein structure prediction, protein-protein interaction, and protein sequence design. We discuss in some details about the Miyazawa-Jernigan contact statistical potential, distance-dependent statistical potentials, as well as geometric statistical potentials. We also describe a geometric model for developing both linear and non-linear potential functions by optimization. Applications of knowledge-based potential functions in protein-decoy discrimination, in protein-protein interactions, and in protein design are then described. Several issues of knowledge-based potential functions are finally discussed.
q-bio.BM:$\beta$-barrel membrane proteins are found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. We have developed probabilistic models to quantify propensities of residues for different spatial locations and for interstrand pairwise contact interactions involving strong H-bonds, side-chain interactions, and weak H-bonds. The propensity values and p-values measuring statistical significance are calculated exactly by analytical formulae we have developed. Contrary to the ``positive-inside'' rule for helical membrane proteins, $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins follow a significant albeit weaker ``positive-outside'' rule, in that the basic residues Arg and Lys are disproportionately favored in the extracellular cap region and disfavored in the periplasmic cap region. Different residue pairs prefer strong backbone H-bonded interstrand pairings (e.g. Gly-Aromatic) or non-H-bonded pairings (e.g. Aromatic-Aromatic). In addition, Tyr and Phe participate in aromatic rescue by shielding Gly from polar environments. These propensities can be used to predict the registration of strand pairs, an important task for the structure prediction of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins. Our accuracy of 44% is considerably better than random (7%) and other studies. Our results imply several experiments that can help to elucidate the mechanisms of in vitro and in vivo folding of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins. See supplementary material after the bibliography for detailed techniques.
q-bio.BM:An effective potential function is critical for protein structure prediction and folding simulation. Simplified protein models such as those requiring only $C_\alpha$ or backbone atoms are attractive because they enable efficient search of the conformational space. We show residue specific reduced discrete state models can represent the backbone conformations of proteins with small RMSD values. However, no potential functions exist that are designed for such simplified protein models. In this study, we develop optimal potential functions by combining contact interaction descriptors and local sequence-structure descriptors. The form of the potential function is a weighted linear sum of all descriptors, and the optimal weight coefficients are obtained through optimization using both native and decoy structures. The performance of the potential function in test of discriminating native protein structures from decoys is evaluated using several benchmark decoy sets. Our potential function requiring only backbone atoms or $C_\alpha$ atoms have comparable or better performance than several residue-based potential functions that require additional coordinates of side chain centers or coordinates of all side chain atoms. By reducing the residue alphabets down to size 5 for local structure-sequence relationship, the performance of the potential function can be further improved. Our results also suggest that local sequence-structure correlation may play important role in reducing the entropic cost of protein folding.
q-bio.BM:Without invoking the Markov approximation, we derive formulas for vibrational energy relaxation (VER) and dephasing for an anharmonic system oscillator using a time-dependent perturbation theory. The system-bath Hamiltonian contains more than the third order coupling terms since we take a normal mode picture as a zeroth order approximation. When we invoke the Markov approximation, our theory reduces to the Maradudin-Fein formula which is used to describe VER properties of glass and proteins. When the system anharmonicity and the renormalization effect due to the environment vanishes, our formulas reduce to those derived by Mikami and Okazaki invoking the path-integral influence functional method [J. Chem. Phys. 121 (2004) 10052]. We apply our formulas to VER of the amide I mode of a small amino-acide like molecule, N-methylacetamide, in heavy water.
q-bio.BM:Simplified Go models, where only native contacts interact favorably, have proven useful to characterize some aspects of the folding of small proteins. The success of these models is limited by the fact that all residues interact in the same way, so that the folding features of a protein are determined only by the geometry of its native conformation. We present an extended version of a C-alpha based Go model where different residues interact with different energies. The model is used to calculate the thermodynamics of three small proteins (Protein G, SrcSH3 and CI2) and the effect of mutations on the wildtype sequence. The model allows to investigate some of the most controversial areas in protein folding such as its earliest stages, a subject which has lately received particular attention. The picture which emerges for the three proteins under study is that of a hierarchical process, where local elementary structures (LES) (not necessarily coincident with elements of secondary structure) are formed at the early stages of the folding and drive the protein, through the transition state and the postcritical folding nucleus (FN), resulting from the docking of the LES, to the native conformation.
q-bio.BM:The chiral nature of DNA plays a crucial role in cellular processes. Here we use magnetic tweezers to explore one of the signatures of this chirality, the coupling between stretch and twist deformations. We show that the extension of a stretched DNA molecule increases linearly by 0.42 nm per excess turn applied to the double helix. This result contradicts the intuition that DNA should lengthen as it is unwound and get shorter with overwinding. We then present numerical results of energy minimizations of torsionally restrained DNA that display a behaviour similar to the experimental data and shed light on the molecular details of this surprising effect.
q-bio.BM:PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), a method which replicates a selected sequence of DNA, has revolutionized the study of genomic material, but mathematical study of the process has been limited to simple deterministic models or descriptions relying on stochastic processes. In this paper we develop a suite of deterministic models for the reactions of quantitative PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) based on the law of mass action. Maps are created from DNA copy number in one cycle to the next, with ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of difference molecular species during each cycle. Qualitative analysis is preformed at each stage and parameters are estimated by fitting each model to data from Roche LightCycler (TM) runs.
q-bio.BM:Kinetics of folding of a protein held in a force-clamp are compared to an unconstrained folding. The comparison is made within a simple topology-based dynamical model of ubiquitin. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed variations in the end-to-end distance reflect microscopic events during folding. However, the folding scenarios in and out of the force-clamp are distinct.
q-bio.BM:In the template-assistance model, normal prion protein (PrPC), the pathogenic cause of prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) in human, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cow, and scrapie in sheep, converts to infectious prion (PrPSc) through an autocatalytic process triggered by a transient interaction between PrPC and PrPSc. Conventional studies suggest the S1-H1-S2 region in PrPC to be the template of S1-S2 $\beta$-sheet in PrPSc, and the conformational conversion of PrPC into PrPSc may involve an unfolding of H1 in PrPC and its refolding into the $\beta$-sheet in PrPSc. Here we conduct a series of simulation experiments to test the idea of transient interaction of the template-assistance model. We find that the integrity of H1 in PrPC is vulnerable to a transient interaction that alters the native dihedral angles at residue Asn$^{143}$, which connects the S1 flank to H1, but not to interactions that alter the internal structure of the S1 flank, nor to those that alter the relative orientation between H1 and the S2 flank.
q-bio.BM:The Yakushevich model of DNA torsion dynamics supports soliton solutions, which are supposed to be of special interest for DNA transcription. In the discussion of the model, one usually adopts the approximation $\ell_0 \to 0$, where $\ell_0$ is a parameter related to the equilibrium distance between bases in a Watson-Crick pair. Here we analyze the Yakushevich model without $\ell_0 \to 0$. The model still supports soliton solutions indexed by two winding numbers $(n,m)$; we discuss in detail the fundamental solitons, corresponding to winding numbers (1,0) and (0,1) respectively.
q-bio.BM:The Yakushevich (Y) model provides a very simple pictures of DNA torsion dynamics, yet yields remarkably correct predictions on certain physical characteristics of the dynamics. In the standard Y model, the interaction between bases of a pair is modelled by a harmonic potential, which becomes anharmonic when described in terms of the rotation angles; here we substitute to this different types of improved potentials, providing a more physical description of the H-bond mediated interactions between the bases. We focus in particular on soliton solutions; the Y model predicts the correct size of the nonlinear excitations supposed to model the ``transcription bubbles'', and this is essentially unchanged with the improved potential. Other features of soliton dynamics, in particular curvature of soliton field configurations and the Peierls-Nabarro barrier, are instead significantly changed.
q-bio.BM:Simple coarse-grained models, such as the Gaussian Network Model, have been shown to capture some of the features of equilibrium protein dynamics. We extend this model by using atomic contacts to define residue interactions and introducing more than one interaction parameter between residues. We use B-factors from 98 ultra-high resolution X-ray crystal structures to optimize the interaction parameters. The average correlation between GNM fluctuation predictions and the B-factors is 0.64 for the data set, consistent with a previous large-scale study. By separating residue interactions into covalent and noncovalent, we achieve an average correlation of 0.74, and addition of ligands and cofactors further improves the correlation to 0.75. However, further separating the noncovalent interactions into nonpolar, polar, and mixed yields no significant improvement. The addition of simple chemical information results in better prediction quality without increasing the size of the coarse-grained model.
q-bio.BM:Background: One-dimensional protein structures such as secondary structures or contact numbers are useful for three-dimensional structure prediction and helpful for intuitive understanding of the sequence-structure relationship. Accurate prediction methods will serve as a basis for these and other purposes. Results: We implemented a program CRNPRED which predicts secondary structures, contact numbers and residue-wise contact orders. This program is based on a novel machine learning scheme called critical random networks. Unlike most conventional one-dimensional structure prediction methods which are based on local windows of an amino acid sequence, CRNPRED takes into account the whole sequence. CRNPRED achieves, on average per chain, Q3 = 81% for secondary structure prediction, and correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.61 for contact number and residue-wise contact order predictions, respectively. Conclusion: CRNPRED will be a useful tool for computational as well as experimental biologists who need accurate one-dimensional protein structure predictions.
q-bio.BM:To confer high specificity and affinity in binding, contacts at interfaces between two interacting macromolecules are expected to exhibit pair preferences for types of atoms or residues. Here we quantify these preferences by measuring the mutual information of contacts for 895 protein-protein interfaces. The information content is significant and is highest at the atomic resolution. A simple phenomenological theory reveals a connection between information at interfaces and the free energy spectrum of association. The connection is presented in the form of a relation between mutual information and the energy gap of the native bound state to off-target bound states. Measurement of information content in designed lattice interfaces show the predicted scaling behavior to the energy gap. Our theory also suggests that mutual information in contacts emerges by a selection mechanism, and that strong selection, or high conservation, of residues should lead to correspondingly high mutual information. Amino acids which contribute more heavily to information content are then expected to be more conserved. We verify this by showing a statistically significant correlation between the conservation of each of the twenty amino acids and their individual contribution to the information content at protein-protein interfaces
q-bio.BM:It was first suggested by Englander et al to model the nonlinear dynamics of DNA relevant to the transcription process in terms of a chain of coupled pendulums. In a related paper [q-bio.BM/0604014] we argued for the advantages of an extension of this approach based on considering a chain of double pendulums with certain characteristics. Here we study a simplified model of this kind, focusing on its general features and nonlinear travelling wave excitations; in particular, we show that some of the degrees of freedom are actually slaved to others, allowing for an effective reduction of the relevant equations.
q-bio.BM:The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) correlation approach to protein-protein docking can evaluate the energies of billions of docked conformations on a grid if the energy is described in the form of a correlation function. Here, this restriction is removed, and the approach is efficiently used with pairwise interactions potentials that substantially improve the docking results. The basic idea is approximating the interaction matrix by its eigenvectors corresponding to the few dominant eigenvalues, resulting in an energy expression written as the sum of a few correlation functions, and solving the problem by repeated FFT calculations. In addition to describing how the method is implemented, we present a novel class of structure based pairwise intermolecular potentials. The DARS (Decoys As the Reference State) potentials are extracted from structures of protein-protein complexes and use large sets of docked conformations as decoys to derive atom pair distributions in the reference state. The current version of the DARS potential works well for enzyme-inhibitor complexes. With the new FFT-based program, DARS provides much better docking results than the earlier approaches, in many cases generating 50\% more near-native docked conformations. Although the potential is far from optimal for antibody-antigen pairs, the results are still slightly better than those given by an earlier FFT method. The docking program PIPER is freely available for non-commercial applications.
q-bio.BM:We investigated the structural relaxation of myosin motor domain from the pre-power stroke state to the near-rigor state using molecular dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained protein model. To describe the structural change, we propose a "dual Go-model," a variant of the Go-like model that has two reference structures. The nucleotide dissociation process is also studied by introducing a coarse-grained nucleotide in the simulation. We found that the myosin structural relaxation toward the near-rigor conformation cannot be completed before the nucleotide dissociation. Moreover, the relaxation and the dissociation occurred cooperatively when the nucleotide was tightly bound to the myosin head. The result suggested that the primary role of the nucleotide is to suppress the structural relaxation.
q-bio.BM:Self-similar properties of the ribosome in terms of the mass fractal dimension are investigated. We find that both the 30S subunit and the 16S rRNA have fractal dimensions of 2.58 and 2.82, respectively; while the 50S subunit as well as the 23S rRNA has the mass fractal dimension close to 3, implying a compact three dimensional macromolecule. This finding supports the dynamic and active role of the 30S subunit in the protein synthesis, in contrast to the pass role of the 50S subunit.
q-bio.BM:We present an extremely simplified model of multiple-domains polymer stretching in an atomic force microscopy experiment. We portray each module as a binary set of contacts and decompose the system energy into a harmonic term (the cantilever) and long-range interactions terms inside each domain. Exact equilibrium computations and Monte Carlo simulations qualitatively reproduce the experimental saw-tooth pattern of force-extension profiles, corresponding (in our model) to first-order phase transitions. We study the influence of the coupling induced by the cantilever and the pulling speed on the relative heights of the force peaks. The results suggest that the increasing height of the critical force for subsequent unfolding events is an out-of-equilibrium effect due to a finite pulling speed. The dependence of the average unfolding force on the pulling speed is shown to reproduce the experimental logarithmic law.
q-bio.BM:Phi-values are experimental measures of the effects of mutations on the folding kinetics of a protein. A central question is which structural information Phi-values contain about the transition state of folding. Traditionally, a Phi-value is interpreted as the 'nativeness' of a mutated residue in the transition state. However, this interpretation is often problematic because it assumes a linear relation between the nativeness of the residue and its free-energy contribution. We present here a better structural interpretation of Phi-values for mutations within a given helix. Our interpretation is based on a simple physical model that distinguishes between secondary and tertiary free-energy contributions of helical residues. From a linear fit of our model to the experimental data, we obtain two structural parameters: the extent of helix formation in the transition state, and the nativeness of tertiary interactions in the transition state. We apply our model to all proteins with well-characterized helices for which more than 10 Phi-values are available: protein A, CI2, and protein L. The model captures nonclassical Phi-values <0 or >1 in these helices, and explains how different mutations at a given site can lead to different Phi-values.
q-bio.BM:A model for the unidirectional movement of dynein is presented based on structural observations and biochemical experimental results available. In this model, the binding affinity of dynein for microtubule is independent of its nucleotide state and the change between strong and weak microtubule-binding is determined naturally by the variation of relative orientation between the stalk and microtubule as the stalk rotates following nucleotide-state transition. Thus the enigmatic communication from the ATP binding site in the globular domain to the far MT-binding site in the tip of the stalk, which is prerequisite in conventional models, is not required. Using the present model, the previous experimental results such as the effect of ATP and ADP bindings on dissociation of dynein from microtubule, the processive movement of single-headed axonemal dyneins at saturating ATP concentration, the load dependence of step size for the processive movement of two-headed cytoplasmic dyneins and the dependence of stall force on ATP concentration can be well explained.
q-bio.BM:Over the last 10-15 years a general understanding of the chemical reaction of protein folding has emerged from statistical mechanics. The lessons learned from protein folding kinetics based on energy landscape ideas have benefited protein structure prediction, in particular the development of coarse grained models. We survey results from blind structure prediction. We explore how second generation prediction energy functions can be developed by introducing information from an ensemble of previously simulated structures. This procedure relies on the assumption of a funnelled energy landscape keeping with the principle of minimal frustration. First generation simulated structures provide an improved input for associative memory energy functions in comparison to the experimental protein structures chosen on the basis of sequence alignment.
q-bio.BM:The precise details of how myosin-V coordinates the biochemical reactions and mechanical motions of its two head elements to engineer effective processive molecular motion along actin filaments remain unresolved. We compare a quantitative kinetic model of the myosin-V walk, consisting of five basic states augmented by two further states to allow for futile hydrolysis and detachments, with experimental results for run lengths, velocities, and dwell times and their dependence on bulk nucleotide concentrations and external loads in both directions. The model reveals how myosin-V can use the internal strain in the molecule to synchronise the motion of the head elements. Estimates for the rate constants in the reaction cycle and the internal strain energy are obtained by a computational comparison scheme involving an extensive exploration of the large parameter space. This scheme exploits the fact that we have obtained analytic results for our reaction network, e.g. for the velocity but also the run length, diffusion constant and fraction of backward steps. The agreement with experiment is often reasonable but some open problems are highlighted, in particular the inability of such a general model to reproduce the reported dependence of run length on ADP. The novel way that our approach explores parameter space means that any confirmed discrepancies should give new insights into the reaction network model.
q-bio.BM:The prion protein (PrP) binds Cu2+ ions in the octarepeat domain of the N-terminal tail up to full occupancy at pH=7.4. Recent experiments show that the HGGG octarepeat subdomain is responsible for holding the metal bound in a square planar coordination. By using first principle ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the Car-Parrinello type, the Cu coordination mode to the binding sites of the PrP octarepeat region is investigated. Simulations are carried out for a number of structured binding sites. Results for the complexes Cu(HGGGW)+(wat), Cu(HGGG) and the 2[Cu(HGGG)] dimer are presented. While the presence of a Trp residue and a H2O molecule does not seem to affect the nature of the Cu coordination, high stability of the bond between Cu and the amide Nitrogens of deprotonated Gly's is confirmed in the case of the Cu(HGGG) system. For the more interesting 2[Cu(HGGG)] dimer a dynamically entangled arrangement of the two monomers, with intertwined N-Cu bonds, emerges. This observation is consistent with the highly packed structure seen in experiments at full Cu occupancy.
q-bio.BM:We formulate a simple solvation potential based on a coarsed-grain representation of amino acids with two spheres modeling the $C_\alpha$ atom and an effective side-chain centroid. The potential relies on a new method for estimating the buried area of residues, based on counting the effective number of burying neighbours in a suitable way. This latter quantity shows a good correlation with the buried area of residues computed from all atom crystallographic structures. We check the discriminatory power of the solvation potential alone to identify the native fold of a protein from a set of decoys and show the potential to be considerably selective.
q-bio.BM:The aim of this work is to elucidate how physical principles of protein design are reflected in natural sequences that evolved in response to the thermal conditions of the environment. Using an exactly solvable lattice model, we design sequences with selected thermal properties. Compositional analysis of designed model sequences and natural proteomes reveals a specific trend in amino acid compositions in response to the requirement of stability at elevated environmental temperature, i.e. the increase of fractions of hydrophobic and charged amino acid residues at the expense of polar ones. We show that this from both ends of hydrophobicity scale trend is due to positive (to stabilize the native state) and negative (to destabilize misfolded states) components of protein design. Negative design strengthens specific repulsive nonnative interactions that appear in misfolded structures. A pressure to preserve specific repulsive interactions in non-native conformations may result in correlated mutations between amino acids which are far apart in the native state but may be in contact in misfolded conformations. Such correlated mutations are indeed found in TIM barrel and other proteins.
q-bio.BM:F-actin bundles constitute principal components of a multitude of cytoskeletal processes including stereocilia, filopodia, microvilli, neurosensory bristles, cytoskeletal stress fibers, and the sperm acrosome. The bending, buckling, and stretching behaviors of these processes play key roles in cellular functions ranging from locomotion to mechanotransduction and fertilization. Despite their central importance to cellular function, F-actin bundle mechanics remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that bundle bending stiffness is a state-dependent quantity with three distinct regimes that are mediated by bundle dimensions in addition to crosslink properties. We calculate the complete state-dependence of the bending stiffness and elucidate the mechanical origin of each. A generic set of design parameters delineating the regimes in state-space is derived and used to predict the bending stiffness of a variety of F-actin bundles found in cells. Finally, the broad and direct implications that the isolated state-dependence of F-actin bundle stiffness has on the interpretation of the bending, buckling, and stretching behavior of cytoskeletal bundles is addressed.
q-bio.BM:In this work we develop a theory of interaction of randomly patterned surfaces as a generic prototype model of protein-protein interactions. The theory predicts that pairs of randomly superimposed identical (homodimeric) random patterns have always twice as large magnitude of the energy fluctuations with respect to their mutual orientation, as compared with pairs of different (heterodimeric) random patterns. The amplitude of the energy fluctuations is proportional to the square of the average pattern density, to the square of the amplitude of the potential and its characteristic length, and scales linearly with the area of surfaces. The greater dispersion of interaction energies in the ensemble of homodimers implies that strongly attractive complexes of random surfaces are much more likely to be homodimers, rather than heterodimers. Our findings suggest a plausible physical reason for the anomalously high fraction of homodimers observed in real protein interaction networks.
q-bio.BM:We extend our previously developed general approach (1) to study a phenomenological model in which the simulated packing of hard, attractive spheres on a prolate spheroid surface with convexity constraints produces structures identical to those of prolate virus capsid structures. Our simulation approach combines the traditional Monte Carlo method with the method of random sampling on an ellipsoidal surface and a convex hull searching algorithm. Using this approach we study the assembly and structural origin of non-icosahedral, elongated virus capsids, such as two aberrant flock house virus (FHV) particles and the prolate prohead of bacteriophage phi29, and discuss the implication of our simulation results in the context of recent experimental findings.
q-bio.BM:The need to understand the assembly kinetics of fibril formation has become urgent because of the realization that soluble oligomers of amyloidogenic peptides may be even more neurotoxic than the end product, namely, the amyloid fibrils. In order to fully understand the routes to fibril formation one has to characterize the major species in the assembly pathways. The characterization of the energetics and dynamics of oligomers (dimers, trimers etc) is difficult using experiments alone because they undergo large conformational fluctuations. In this context, carefully planned molecular dynamics simulation studies, computations using coarse-grained models, and bioinformatic analysis have given considerable insights into the early events in the route to fibril formation. Here, we describe progress along this direction using examples taken largely from our own work. In this chapter, we focus on aspects of protein aggregation using Abeta-peptides and prion proteins as examples.
q-bio.BM:The native three dimensional structure of a single protein is determined by the physico chemical nature of its constituent amino acids. The twenty different types of amino acids, depending on their physico chemical properties, can be grouped into three major classes - hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged. We have studied the anatomy of the weighted and unweighted networks of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues separately for a large number of proteins. Our results show that the average degree of the hydrophobic networks has significantly larger value than that of hydrophilic and charged networks. The average degree of the hydrophilic networks is slightly higher than that of charged networks. The average strength of the nodes of hydrophobic networks is nearly equal to that of the charged network; whereas that of hydrophilic networks has smaller value than that of hydrophobic and charged networks. The average strength for each of the three types of networks varies with its degree. The average strength of a node in charged networks increases more sharply than that of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic networks. Each of the three types of networks exhibits the 'small-world' property. Our results further indicate that the all amino acids' networks and hydrophobic networks are of assortative type. While maximum of the hydrophilic and charged networks are of assortative type, few others have the characteristics of disassortative mixing of the nodes. We have further observed that all amino acids' networks and hydrophobic networks bear the signature of hierarchy; whereas the hydrophilic and charged networks do not have any hierarchical signature.
q-bio.BM:We study statistical properties of interacting protein-like surfaces and predict two strong, related effects: (i) statistically enhanced self-attraction of proteins; (ii) statistically enhanced attraction of proteins with similar structures. The effects originate in the fact that the probability to find a pattern self-match between two identical, even randomly organized interacting protein surfaces is always higher compared with the probability for a pattern match between two different, promiscuous protein surfaces. This theoretical finding explains statistical prevalence of homodimers in protein-protein interaction networks reported earlier. Further, our findings are confirmed by the analysis of curated database of protein complexes that showed highly statistically significant overrepresentation of dimers formed by structurally similar proteins with highly divergent sequences (superfamily heterodimers). We predict that significant fraction of heterodimers evolved from homodimers with the negative design evolutionary pressure applied against promiscuous homodimer formation. This is achieved through the formation of highly specific contacts formed by charged residues as demonstrated both in model and real superfamily heterodimers
q-bio.BM:Stretching of a protein by a fluid flow is compared to that in a force-clamp apparatus. The comparison is made within a simple topology-based dynamical model of a protein in which the effects of the flow are implemented using Langevin dynamics. We demonstrate that unfolding induced by a uniform flow shows a richer behavior than that in the force clamp. The dynamics of unfolding is found to depend strongly on the selection of the amino acid, usually one of the termini, which is anchored. These features offer potentially wider diagnostic tools to investigate structure of proteins compared to experiments based on the atomic force microscopy.
q-bio.BM:Secretion and role of autotaxin and lysophosphatidic acid in adipose tissue In obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy is often associated with recrutement of new fat cells (adipogenesis) under the control of circulating and local regulatory factors. Among the different lipids released in the extracellular compartment of adipocytes, our group found the presence of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is a bioactive phospholipid able to regulate several cell responses via the activation of specific G-protein coupled membrane receptors. Our group found that LPA increases preadipocyte proliferation and inhibits adipogenesis via the activation of LPA1 receptor subtype. Extracellular LPA-synthesis is catalyzed by a lysophospholipase D secreted by adipocytes : autotaxin (ATX). Adipocyte ATX expression strongly increases with adipogenesis as well as in individuals exhibiting type 2 diabetes associated with massive obesity. A possible contribution of ATX and LPA as paracrine regulators of adipogenesis and obesity associated diabetes is proposed.
q-bio.BM:A recently proposed model of non-autocatalytic reactions in dipeptide reactions leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking and homochirality is examined. The model is governed by activation, polymerization, epimerization and depolymerization of amino acids. Symmetry breaking is primarily a consequence of the fact that the rates of reactions involving homodimers and heterodimers are different, i.e., stereoselective, and on the fact that epimerization can only occur on the N-terminal residue and not on the Cterminal residue. This corresponds to an auto-inductive cyclic process that works only in one sense. It is argued that epimerization mimics both autocatalytic behavior as well as mutual antagonism - both of which were known to be crucial for producing full homochirality.
q-bio.BM:The structural organisation of the viral genome within its protein container, called the viral capsid, is an important aspect of virus architecture. Many single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses organise a significant part of their genome in a dodecahedral cage as a RNA duplex structure that mirrors the symmetry of the capsid. Bruinsma and Rudnick have suggested a model for the structural organisation of the RNA in these cages. It is the purpose of this paper to further develop their approach based on results from the areas of graph theory and DNA network engineering. We start by suggesting a scenario for pariacoto virus, a representative of this class of viruses, that is energetically more favorable than those derived previously. We then show that it is a representative of a whole family of cage structures that abide to the same construction principle, and then derive the energetically optimal configuration for a second family of cage structures along similar lines. Finally, we give reasons for the conjecture that these two families are more likely to occur in nature than other scenarios.
q-bio.BM:The sequence-dependent elasticity of double-helical DNA on a nm length scale can be captured by the rigid base-pair model, whose strains are the relative position and orientation of adjacent base-pairs. Corresponding elastic potentials have been obtained from all-atom MD simulation and from high-resolution structural data. On the scale of a hundred nm, DNA is successfully described by a continuous worm-like chain model with homogeneous elastic properties characterized by a set of four elastic constants, which have been directly measured in single-molecule experiments. We present here a theory that links these experiments on different scales, by systematically coarse-graining the rigid base-pair model for random sequence DNA to an effective worm-like chain description. The average helical geometry of the molecule is exactly taken into account in our approach. We find that the available microscopic parameters sets predict qualitatively similar mesoscopic parameters. The thermal bending and twisting persistence lengths computed from MD data are 42 and 48 nm, respectively. The static persistence lengths are generally much higher, in agreement with cyclization experiments. All microscopic parameter sets predict negative twist-stretch coupling. The variability and anisotropy of bending stiffness in short random chains lead to non-Gaussian bend angle distributions, but become unimportant after two helical turns.
q-bio.BM:Processive molecular motors take more-or-less uniformly sized steps, along spatially periodic tracks, mostly forwards but increasingly backwards under loads. Experimentally, the major steps can be resolved clearly within the noise but one knows biochemically that one or more mechanochemical substeps remain hidden in each enzymatic cycle. In order to properly interpret experimental data for back/forward step ratios, mean conditional step-to-step dwell times, etc., a first-passage analysis has been developed that takes account of hidden substeps in $N$-state sequential models. The explicit, general results differ significantly from previous treatments that identify the observed steps with complete mechanochemical cycles; e.g., the mean dwell times $\tau_+$ and $\tau_-$ prior to forward and back steps, respectively, are normally {\it unequal} although the dwell times $\tau_{++}$ and $\tau_{--}$ between {\it successive} forward and back steps are equal. Illustrative (N=2)-state examples display a wide range of behavior. The formulation extends to the case of two or more detectable transitions in a multistate cycle with hidden substeps.
q-bio.BM:For the vast majority of naturally occurring, small, single domain proteins folding is often described as a two-state process that lacks detectable intermediates. This observation has often been rationalized on the basis of a nucleation mechanism for protein folding whose basic premise is the idea that after completion of a specific set of contacts forming the so-called folding nucleus the native state is achieved promptly. Here we propose a methodology to identify folding nuclei in small lattice polymers and apply it to the study of protein molecules with chain length N=48. To investigate the extent to which protein topology is a robust determinant of the nucleation mechanism we compare the nucleation scenario of a native-centric model with that of a sequence specific model sharing the same native fold. To evaluate the impact of the sequence's finner details in the nucleation mechanism we consider the folding of two non- homologous sequences. We conclude that in a sequence-specific model the folding nucleus is, to some extent, formed by the most stable contacts in the protein and that the less stable linkages in the folding nucleus are solely determined by the fold's topology. We have also found that independently of protein sequence the folding nucleus performs the same `topological' function. This unifying feature of the nucleation mechanism results from the residues forming the folding nucleus being distributed along the protein chain in a similar and well-defined manner that is determined by the fold's topological features.
q-bio.BM:The folding of naturally occurring, single domain proteins is usually well-described as a simple, single exponential process lacking significant trapped states. Here we further explore the hypothesis that the smooth energy landscape this implies, and the rapid kinetics it engenders, arises due to the extraordinary thermodynamic cooperativity of protein folding. Studying Miyazawa-Jernigan lattice polymers we find that, even under conditions where the folding energy landscape is relatively optimized (designed sequences folding at their temperature of maximum folding rate), the folding of protein-like heteropolymers is accelerated when their thermodynamic cooperativity enhanced by enhancing the non-additivity of their energy potentials. At lower temperatures, where kinetic traps presumably play a more significant role in defining folding rates, we observe still greater cooperativity-induced acceleration. Consistent with these observations, we find that the folding kinetics of our computational models more closely approximate single-exponential behavior as their cooperativity approaches optimal levels. These observations suggest that the rapid folding of naturally occurring proteins is, at least in part, consequences of their remarkably cooperative folding.
q-bio.BM:An increasing number of proteins are being discovered with a remarkable and somewhat surprising feature, a knot in their native structures. How the polypeptide chain is able to knot itself during the folding process to form these highly intricate protein topologies is not known. Here, we perform a computational study on the 160-amino acid homodimeric protein YibK which, like other proteins in the SpoU family of MTases, contains a deep trefoil knot in its C-terminal region. In this study, we use a coarse-grained C-alpha-chain representation and Langevin dynamics to study folding kinetics. We find that specific, attractive nonnative interactions are critical for knot formation. In the absence of these interactions, i.e. in an energetics driven entirely by native interactions, knot formation is exceedingly unlikely. Further, we find, in concert with recent experimental data on YibK, two parallel folding pathways which we attribute to an early and a late formation of the trefoil knot, respectively. For both pathways, knot formation occurs before dimerization. A bioinformatics analysis of the SpoU family of proteins reveals further that the critical nonnative interactions may originate from evolutionary conserved hydrophobic segments around the knotted region.
q-bio.BM:The structure of the self-cleaving hairpin ribozyme is well characterized, and its folding has been examined in bulk and by single-molecule fluorescence, establishing the importance of cations, especially magnesium in the stability of the native fold. Here we describe the first all-atom folding simulations of the hairpin ribozyme, using a version of a Go potential with separate secondary and tertiary structure energetic contributions. The ratio of tertiary/secondary interaction energies serves as a proxy for non-specific cation binding: a high ratio corresponds to a high concentration, while a low one mimics low concentration. By studying the unfolding behavior of the RNA over a range of temperature and tertiary/secondary energies, a three-state phase diagram emerges, with folded, unfolded (coil) and transient folding/unfolding tertiary structure species. The thermodynamics were verified by paired folding simulations in each region of the phase diagram. The three phase behaviors correspond with experimentally observed states, so this simple model captures the essential aspect of thermodynamics in RNA folding.
q-bio.BM:The refolding from stretched initial conformations of ubiquitin (PDB ID: 1ubq) under the quenched force is studied using the Go model and the Langevin dynamics. It is shown that the refolding decouples the collapse and folding kinetics. The force quench refolding times scale as tau_F ~ exp(f_q*x_F/k_B*T), where f_q is the quench force and x_F = 0.96 nm is the location of the average transition state along the reaction coordinate given by the end-to-end distance. This value is close to x_F = 0.8 nm obtained from the force-clamp experiments. The mechanical and thermal unfolding pathways are studied and compared with the experimental and all-atom simulation results in detail. The sequencing of thermal unfolding was found to be markedly different from the mechanical one. It is found that fixing the N-terminus of ubiquitin changes its mechanical unfolding pathways much more drastically compared to the case when the C-end is anchored. We obtained the distance between the native state and the transition state x_UF=0.24 nm which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.
q-bio.BM:Natural proteins fold to a unique, thermodynamically dominant state. Modeling of the folding process and prediction of the native fold of proteins are two major unsolved problems in biophysics. Here, we show successful all-atom ab initio folding of a representative diverse set of proteins, using a minimalist transferable energy model that consists of two-body atom-atom interactions, hydrogen-bonding, and a local sequence energy term that models sequence-specific chain stiffness. Starting from a random coil, the native-like structure was observed during replica exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) simulation for most proteins regardless of their structural classes; the lowest energy structure was close to native- in the range of 2-6 A root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). Our results demonstrate that the successful all-atom folding of a protein chain to its native state is governed by only a few crucial energetic terms.
q-bio.BM:Protein-DNA interactions are vital for many processes in living cells, especially transcriptional regulation and DNA modification. To further our understanding of these important processes on the microscopic level, it is necessary that theoretical models describe the macromolecular interaction energetics accurately. While several methods have been proposed, there has not been a careful comparison of how well the different methods are able to predict biologically important quantities such as the correct DNA binding sequence, total binding free energy, and free energy changes caused by DNA mutation. In addition to carrying out the comparison, we present two important theoretical models developed initially in protein folding that have not yet been tried on protein-DNA interactions. In the process, we find that the results of these knowledge-based potentials show a strong dependence on the interaction distance and the derivation method. Finally, we present a knowledge-based potential that gives comparable or superior results to the best of the other methods, including the molecular mechanics force field AMBER99.
q-bio.BM:The folding of the alpha-helice domain hbSBD of the mammalian mitochondrial branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex is studied by the circular dichroism technique in absence of urea. Thermal denaturation is used to evaluate various thermodynamic parameters defining the equilibrium unfolding, which is well described by the two-state model with the folding temperature T_f = 317.8 K and the enthalpy change Delta H_g = 19.67 kcal/mol. The folding is also studied numerically using the off-lattice coarse-grained Go model and the Langevin dynamics. The obtained results, including the population of the native basin, the free energy landscape as a function of the number of native contacts and the folding kinetics, also suggest that the hbSBD domain is a two-state folder. These results are consistent with the biological function of hbSBD in BCKD.
q-bio.BM:We analyze the dependence of cooperativity of the thermal denaturation transition and folding rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid residues, $N$, using lattice models with side chains,off-lattice Go models and the available experimental data. A dimensionless measure of cooperativity, $\Omega_c$ ($0 < \Omega_c < \infty$), scales as $\Omega_c \sim N^{\zeta}$. The results of simulations and the analysis of experimental data further confirm the earlier prediction that $\zeta$ is universal with $\zeta = 1 +\gamma$, where exponent $\gamma$ characterizes the susceptibility of a self-avoiding walk. This finding suggests that the structural characteristics in the denaturated state are manifested in the folding cooperativity at the transition temperature. The folding rates $k_F$ for the Go models and a dataset of 69 proteins can be fit using $k_F = k_F^0 \exp(-cN^\beta)$. Both $\beta = 1/2$ and 2/3 provide a good fit of the data. We find that $k_F = k_F^0 \exp(-cN^{{1/2}})$, with the average (over the dataset of proteins) $k_F^0 \approx (0.2\mu s)^{-1}$ and $c \approx 1.1$, can be used to estimate folding rates to within an order of magnitude in most cases. The minimal models give identical $N$ dependence with $c \approx 1$. The prefactor for off-lattice Go models is nearly four orders of magnitude larger than the experimental value.
q-bio.BM:The didemnins represent a versatile class of depsipeptides of marine origin and hold a great deal of potential for biomedical application. The biological and geographical origins of the didemnins are reviewed in addition to the chemical structures of the major didemnins. The biological mechanisms behind the antiviral and anticancer effects of selected didemnins are summarized and the special case of dehydrodidemnin B (Aplidin) is expounded upon including structural characteristics, synthesis, pharmacological mechanism and a discussion of its current clinical trials as an anticancer agent.
q-bio.BM:TThe paper had many errors.
q-bio.BM:Pathological folding and oligomer formation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are widely perceived as central to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental approaches to study Abeta self-assembly are problematic, because most relevant aggregates are quasi-stable and inhomogeneous. We apply a discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) approach combined with a four-bead protein model to study oligomer formation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). We address the differences between the two most common Abeta alloforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, which oligomerize differently in vitro. We study how the presence of electrostatic interactions (EIs) between pairs of charged amino acids affects Abeta40 and Abeta42 oligomer formation. Our results indicate that EIs promote formation of larger oligomers in both Abeta40 and Abeta42. The Abeta40 size distribution remains unimodal, whereas the Abeta42 distribution is trimodal, as observed experimentally. Abeta42 folded structure is characterized by a turn in the C-terminus that is not present in Abeta40. We show that the same C-terminal region is also responsible for the strongest intermolecular contacts in Abeta42 pentamers and larger oligomers. Our results suggest that this C-terminal region plays a key role in the formation of Abeta42 oligomers and the relative importance of this region increases in the presence of EIs. These results suggest that inhibitors targeting the C-terminal region of Abeta42 oligomers may be able to prevent oligomer formation or structurally modify the assemblies to reduce their toxicity.
q-bio.BM:The results of Brownian dynamics simulations of a single DNA molecule in shear flow are presented taking into account the effect of internal viscosity. The dissipative mechanism of internal viscosity is proved necessary in the research of DNA dynamics. A stochastic model is derived on the basis of the balance equation for forces acting on the chain. The Euler method is applied to the solution of the model. The extensions of DNA molecules for different Weissenberg numbers are analyzed. Comparison with the experimental results available in the literature is carried out to estimate the contribution of the effect of internal viscosity.
q-bio.BM:The network paradigm is increasingly used to describe the topology and dynamics of complex systems. Here we review the results of the topological analysis of protein structures as molecular networks describing their small-world character, and the role of hubs and central network elements in governing enzyme activity, allosteric regulation, protein motor function, signal transduction and protein stability. We summarize available data how central network elements are enriched in active centers and ligand binding sites directing the dynamics of the entire protein. We assess the feasibility of conformational and energy networks to simplify the vast complexity of rugged energy landscapes and to predict protein folding and dynamics. Finally, we suggest that modular analysis, novel centrality measures, hierarchical representation of networks and the analysis of network dynamics will soon lead to an expansion of this field.
q-bio.BM:Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense. Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.
q-bio.BM:Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is bendable, e.g. at a localized "hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of "cargo'' attached to the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.
q-bio.BM:We report 10 successfully folding events of trpzip2 by molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the trizip2 can fold into its native state through different zipper pathways, depending on the ways of forming hydrophobic core. We also find a very fast non-zipper pathway. This indicates that there may be no inconsistencies in the current pictures of beta-hairpin folding mechanisms. These pathways occur with different probabilities. zip-out is the most probable one. This may explain the recent experiment that the turn formation is the rate-limiting step for beta-hairpin folding.
q-bio.BM:Structural fluctuations in the thermal equilibrium of the kinesin motor domain are studied using a lattice protein model with Go interactions. By means of the multi-self-overlap ensemble (MSOE) Monte Carlo method and the principal component analysis (PCA), the free-energy landscape is obtained. It is shown that kinesins have two subdomains that exhibit partial folding/unfolding at functionally important regions: one is located around the nucleotide binding site and the other includes the main microtubule binding site. These subdomains are consistent with structural variability that was reported recently based on experimentally-obtained structures. On the other hand, such large structural fluctuations have not been captured by B-factor or normal mode analyses. Thus, they are beyond the elastic regime, and it is essential to take into account chain connectivity for studying the function of kinesins.
q-bio.BM:We introduce a topology-based nonlinear network model of protein dynamics with the aim of investigating the interplay of spatial disorder and nonlinearity. We show that spontaneous localization of energy occurs generically and is a site-dependent process. Localized modes of nonlinear origin form spontaneously in the stiffest parts of the structure and display site-dependent activation energies. Our results provide a straightforward way for understanding the recently discovered link between protein local stiffness and enzymatic activity. They strongly suggest that nonlinear phenomena may play an important role in enzyme function, allowing for energy storage during the catalytic process.
q-bio.BM:We incorporate hydrodynamic interactions in a structure-based model of ubiquitin and demonstrate that the hydrodynamic coupling may reduce the peak force when stretching the protein at constant speed, especially at larger speeds. Hydrodynamic interactions are also shown to facilitate unfolding at constant force and inhibit stretching by fluid flows.
q-bio.BM:We demonstrate a new algorithm for finding protein conformations that minimize a non-bonded energy function. The new algorithm, called the difference map, seeks to find an atomic configuration that is simultaneously in two constraint spaces. The first constraint space is the space of atomic configurations that have a valid peptide geometry, while the second is the space of configurations that have a non-bonded energy below a given target. These two constraint spaces are used to define a deterministic dynamical system, whose fixed points produce atomic configurations in the intersection of the two constraint spaces. The rate at which the difference map produces low energy protein conformations is compared with that of a contemporary search algorithm, parallel tempering. The results indicate the difference map finds low energy protein conformations at a significantly higher rate then parallel tempering.
q-bio.BM:Vibrational energy transfer of the amide I mode of N-methylacetamide (NMA) is studied theoretically using the vibrational configuration interaction method. A quartic force field of NMA is constructed at the B3LYP/6-31G+(d) level of theory and its accuarcy is checked by comparing the resulting anharmonic frequencies with available theoretical and experimental values. Quantum dynamics calculations for the amide I mode excitation clarify the dominant energy transfer pathways, which sensitively depend on the anharmonic couplings among vibrational modes. A ratio of the anharmonic coupling to the frequency mismatch is employed to predict and interpret the dominant energy flow pathways.
q-bio.BM:It previously has been discovered that visible light irradiation of crystalline substrates can lead to enhancement of subsequent enzymatic reaction rates as sharply peaked oscillatory functions of irradiation time. The particular activating irradiation times can vary with source of a given enzyme and thus, presumably, its molecular structure. The experiments reported here demonstrate that the potential for this anomalous enzyme reaction rate enhancement can be transferred from one bacterial species to another coincident with transfer of the genetic determinant for the relevant enzyme. In particular, the effect of crystal-irradiated chloramphenicol on growth of bacterial strains in which a transferable R-factor DNA plasmid coding for chloramphenicol resistance was or was not present (S. panama R+, E. coli R+, and E. coli R-) was determined. Chloramphenicol samples irradiated 10, 35 and 60 sec produced increased growth rates (diminished inhibition) for the resistant S. panama and E. coli strains, while having no such effect on growth rate of the sensitive E. coli strain. Consistent with past findings, chloramphenicol samples irradiated 5, 30 and 55 sec produced decreased growth rates (increased inhibition) for all three strains.
q-bio.BM:Inherent structure theory is used to discover strong connections between simple characteristics of protein structure and the energy landscape of a Go model. The potential energies and vibrational free energies of inherent structures are highly correlated, and both reflect simple measures of networks of native contacts. These connections have important consequences for models of protein dynamics and thermodynamics.
q-bio.BM:The free-energy landscape of the alpha-helix of protein G is studied by means of metadynamics coupled with a solute tempering algorithm. Metadynamics allows to overcome large energy barriers, whereas solute tempering improves the sampling with an affordable computational effort. From the sampled free-energy surface we are able to reproduce a number of experimental observations, such as the fact that the lowest minimum corresponds to a globular conformation displaying some degree of beta-structure, that the helical state is metastable and involves only 65% of the chain. The calculations also show that the system populates consistently a pi-helix state and that the hydrophobic staple motif is present only in the free-energy minimum associated with the helices, and contributes to their stabilization. The use of metadynamics coupled with solute tempering results then particularly suitable to provide the thermodynamics of a short peptide, and its computational efficiency is promising to deal with larger proteins.
q-bio.BM:Using a time-dependent perturbation theory, vibrational energy relaxation (VER) of isotopically labeled amide I modes in cytochrome c solvated with water is investigated. Contributions to the VER are decomposed into two contributions from the protein and water. The VER pathways are visualized using radial and angular excitation functions for resonant normal modes. Key differences of VER among different amide I modes are demonstrated, leading to a detailed picture of the spatial anisotropy of the VER. The results support the experimental observation that amide I modes in proteins relax with sub picosecond timescales, while the relaxation mechanism turns out to be sensitive to the environment of the amide I mode.
q-bio.BM:Local minima and the saddle points separating them in the energy landscape are known to dominate the dynamics of biopolymer folding. Here we introduce a notion of a "folding funnel" that is concisely defined in terms of energy minima and saddle points, while at the same time conforming to a notion of a "folding funnel" as it is discussed in the protein folding literature.
q-bio.BM:Using magnetic tweezers to investigate the mechanical response of single chromatin fibers, we show that fibers submitted to large positive torsion transiently trap positive turns, at a rate of one turn per nucleosome. A comparison with the response of fibers of tetrasomes (the (H3-H4)2 tetramer bound with ~50 bp of DNA) obtained by depletion of H2A-H2B dimers, suggests that the trapping reflects a nucleosome chiral transition to a metastable form built on the previously documented righthanded tetrasome. In view of its low energy, <8 kT, we propose this transition is physiologically relevant and serves to break the docking of the dimers on the tetramer which in the absence of other factors exerts a strong block against elongation of transcription by the main RNA polymerase.
q-bio.BM:We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice model and the Go potential to investigate the existence of folding pathways at the level of contact cluster formation for two native structures with markedly different geometries. Our analysis of folding pathways revealed a common underlying folding mechanism, based on nucleation phenomena, for both protein models. However, folding to the more complex geometry (i.e. that with more non-local contacts) is driven by a folding nucleus whose geometric traits more closely resemble those of the native fold. For this geometry folding is clearly a more cooperative process.
q-bio.BM:In this study we evaluate, at full atomic detail, the folding processes of two small helical proteins, the B domain of protein A and the Villin headpiece. Folding kinetics are studied by performing a large number of ab initio Monte Carlo folding simulations using a single transferable all-atom potential. Using these trajectories, we examine the relaxation behavior, secondary structure formation, and transition-state ensembles (TSEs) of the two proteins and compare our results with experimental data and previous computational studies. To obtain a detailed structural information on the folding dynamics viewed as an ensemble process, we perform a clustering analysis procedure based on graph theory. Moreover, rigorous pfold analysis is used to obtain representative samples of the TSEs and a good quantitative agreement between experimental and simulated Fi-values is obtained for protein A. Fi-values for Villin are also obtained and left as predictions to be tested by future experiments. Our analysis shows that two-helix hairpin is a common partially stable structural motif that gets formed prior to entering the TSE in the studied proteins. These results together with our earlier study of Engrailed Homeodomain and recent experimental studies provide a comprehensive, atomic-level picture of folding mechanics of three-helix bundle proteins.
q-bio.BM:Strong experimental and theoretical evidence shows that transcription factors and other specific DNA-binding proteins find their sites using a two-mode search: alternating between 3D diffusion through the cell and 1D sliding along the DNA. We consider the role spatial effects in the mechanism on two different scales. First, we reconcile recent experimental findings by showing that the 3D diffusion of the transcription factor is often local, i.e. the transcription factor lands quite near its dissociation site. Second, we discriminate between two types of searches: global searches and local searches. We show that these searches differ significantly in average search time and the variability of search time. Using experimentally measured parameter values, we also show that 1D and 3D search is not optimally balanced, leading to much larger estimates of search time. Together, these results lead to a number of biological implications including suggestions of how prokaryotes and eukaryotes achieve rapid gene regulation and the relationship between the search mechanism and noise in gene expression.
q-bio.BM:Thermal shape fluctuations of grafted microtubules were studied using high resolution particle tracking of attached fluorescent beads. First mode relaxation times were extracted from the mean square displacement in the transverse coordinate. For microtubules shorter than 10 um, the relaxation times were found to follow an L^2 dependence instead of L^4 as expected from the standard wormlike chain model. This length dependence is shown to result from a complex length dependence of the bending stiffness which can be understood as a result of the molecular architecture of microtubules. For microtubules shorter than 5 um, high drag coefficients indicate contributions from internal friction to the fluctuation dynamics.
q-bio.BM:E. Coli. dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) undergoes conformational transitions between the closed (CS) and occluded (OS) states which, respectively, describe whether the active site is closed or occluded by the Met20 loop. A sequence-based approach is used to identify a network of residues that represents the allostery wiring diagram. We also use a self-organized polymer model to monitor the kinetics of the CS->OS and the reverse transitions. a sliding motion of Met20 loop is observed. The residues that facilitate the Met20 loop motion are part of the network of residues that transmit allosteric signals during the CS->OS transition.
q-bio.BM:A model is presented to describe the nucleotide and repeat addition processivity by the telomerase. In the model, the processive nucleotide addition is implemented on the basis of two requirements: One is that stem IV loop stimulates the chemical reaction of nucleotide incorporation, and the other one is the existence of an ssRNA-binding site adjacent to the polymerase site that has a high affinity for the unpaired base of the template. The unpairing of DNA:RNA hybrid after the incorporation of the nucleotide paired with the last base on the template, which is the prerequisite for repeat addition processivity, is caused by a force acting on the primer. The force is resulted from the unfolding of stem III pseudoknot that is induced by the swinging of stem IV loop towards the nucleotide-bound polymerase site. Based on the model, the dynamics of processive nucleotide and repeat additions by Tetrahymena telomerase are quantitatively studied, which give good explanations to the previous experimental results. Moreover, some predictions are presented. In particular, it is predicted that the repeat addition processivity is mainly determined by the difference between the free energy required to disrupt the DNA:RNA hybrid and that required to unfold the stem III pseudoknot, with the large difference corresponding to a low repeat addition processivity while the small one corresponding to a high repeat addition processivity.
q-bio.BM:Small single-domain proteins often exhibit only a single free-energy barrier, or transition state, between the denatured and the native state. The folding kinetics of these proteins is usually explored via mutational analysis. A central question is which structural information on the transition state can be derived from the mutational data. In this article, we model and structurally interpret mutational Phi-values for two small beta-sheet proteins, the PIN and the FBP WW domain. The native structure of these WW domains comprises two beta-hairpins that form a three-stranded beta-sheet. In our model, we assume that the transition state consists of two conformations in which either one of the hairpins is formed. Such a transition state has been recently observed in Molecular Dynamics folding-unfolding simulations of a small designed three-stranded beta-sheet protein. We obtain good agreement with the experimental data (i) by splitting up the mutation-induced free-energy changes into terms for the two hairpins and for the small hydrophobic core of the proteins, and (ii) by fitting a single parameter, the relative degree to which hairpin 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state. The model helps to understand how mutations affect the folding kinetics of WW domains, and captures also negative Phi-values that have been difficult to interpret.
q-bio.BM:Simple theoretical concepts and models have been helpful to understand the folding rates and routes of single-domain proteins. As reviewed in this article, a physical principle that appears to underly these models is loop closure.
q-bio.BM:The isotopic composition, for example, 14C/12C, 13C/12C, 2H/1H, 15N/14N and 18O/16O, of the elements of matter is heterogeneous. It is ruled by physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. Isotopes can be employed to follow the fate of mineral and organic compounds during biogeochemical transformations. The determination of the isotopic composition of organic substances occurring at trace level in very complex mixtures such as sediments, soils and blood, has been made possible during the last 20 years due to the rapid development of molecular level isotopic techniques. After a brief glance at pioneering studies revealing isotopic breakthroughs at the molecular and intramolecular levels, this paper reviews selected applications of compound-specific isotope analysis in various scientific fields.
q-bio.BM:The conformational dynamics of a single protein molecule in a shear flow is investigated using Brownian dynamics simulations. A structure-based coarse grained model of a protein is used. We consider two proteins, ubiquitin and integrin, and find that at moderate shear rates they unfold through a sequence of metastable states - a pattern which is distinct from a smooth unraveling found in homopolymers. Full unfolding occurs only at very large shear rates. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic interactions between the amino acids are shown to hinder the shear flow unfolding. The characteristics of the unfolding process depend on whether a protein is anchored or not, and if it is, on the choice of an anchoring point.
q-bio.BM:We demonstrate that a common-line method can assemble a 3D oversampled diffracted intensity distribution suitable for high-resolution structure solution from a set of measured 2D diffraction patterns, as proposed in experiments with an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) (Neutze {\it et al.}, 2000). Even for a flat Ewald sphere, we show how the ambiguities due to Friedel's Law may be overcome. The method breaks down for photon counts below about 10 per detector pixel, almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than expected for scattering by a 500 kDa protein with an XFEL beam focused to a 0.1 micron diameter spot. Even if 10**3 orientationally similar diffraction patterns could be identified and added to reach the requisite photon count per pixel, the need for about 10**6 orientational classes for high-resolution structure determination suggests that about ~ 10**9 diffraction patterns must be recorded. Assuming pulse and read-out rates of 100 Hz, such measurements would require ~ 10**7 seconds, i.e. several months of continuous beam time.
q-bio.BM:Background. All-atom crystallographic refinement of proteins is a laborious manually driven procedure, as a result of which, alternative and multiconformer interpretations are not routinely investigated.   Results. We describe efficient loop sampling procedures in Rappertk and demonstrate that single loops in proteins can be automatically and accurately modelled with few positional restraints. Loops constructed with a composite CNS/Rappertk protocol consistently have better Rfree than those with CNS alone. This approach is extended to a more realistic scenario where there are often large positional uncertainties in loops along with small imperfections in the secondary structural framework. Both ensemble and collection methods are used to estimate the structural heterogeneity of loop regions.   Conclusion. Apart from benchmarking Rappertk for the all-atom protein refinement task, this work also demonstrates its utility in both aspects of loop modelling - building a single conformer and estimating structural heterogeneity the loops can exhibit.
q-bio.BM:Background. Dramatic increases in RNA structural data have made it possible to recognize its conformational preferences much better than a decade ago. This has created an opportunity to use discrete restraint-based conformational sampling for modelling RNA and automating its crystallographic refinement. Results. All-atom sampling of entire RNA chains, termini and loops is achieved using the Richardson RNA backbone rotamer library and an unbiased distribution for glycosidic dihedral angle. Sampling behaviour of Rappertk on a diverse dataset of RNA chains under varying spatial restraints is benchmarked. The iterative composite crystallographic refinement protocol developed here is demonstrated to outperform CNS-only refinement on parts of tRNA(Asp) structure. Conclusion. This work opens exciting possibilities for further work in RNA modelling and crystallography.
q-bio.BM:DNA torsion dynamics is essential in the transcription process; simple models for it have been proposed by several authors, in particular Yakushevich (Y model). These are strongly related to models of DNA separation dynamics such as the one first proposed by Peyrard and Bishop (and developed by Dauxois, Barbi, Cocco and Monasson among others), but support topological solitons. We recently developed a ``composite'' version of the Y model, in which the sugar-phosphate group and the base are described by separate degrees of freedom. This at the same time fits experimental data better than the simple Y model, and shows dynamical phenomena, which are of interest beyond DNA dynamics. Of particular relevance are the mechanism for selecting the speed of solitons by tuning the physical parameters of the non linear medium and the hierarchal separation of the relevant degrees of freedom in ``master'' and ``slave''. These mechanisms apply not only do DNA, but also to more general macromolecules, as we show concretely by considering polyethylene.
q-bio.BM:The Caspar-Klug classification of viruses whose protein shell, called viral capsid, exhibits icosahedral symmetry, has recently been extended to incorporate viruses whose capsid proteins are exclusively organised in pentamers. The approach, named `Viral Tiling Theory', is inspired by the theory of quasicrystals, where aperiodic Penrose tilings enjoy 5-fold and 10-fold local symmetries. This paper analyzes the extent to which this classification approach informs dynamical properties of the viral capsids, in particular the pattern of Raman active modes of vibrations, which can be observed experimentally.
q-bio.BM:Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are useful for detecting weak homology in protein sequence analysis, and they are thought to contain some essential signatures of the protein families. In order to elucidate what kind of ingredients constitute such family-specific signatures, we apply singular value decomposition to a set of PSSMs and examine the properties of dominant right and left singular vectors. The first right singular vectors were correlated with various amino acid indices including relative mutability, amino acid composition in protein interior, hydropathy, or turn propensity, depending on proteins. A significant correlation between the first left singular vector and a measure of site conservation was observed. It is shown that the contribution of the first singular component to the PSSMs act to disfavor potentially but falsely functionally important residues at conserved sites. The second right singular vectors were highly correlated with hydrophobicity scales, and the corresponding left singular vectors with contact numbers of protein structures. It is suggested that sequence alignment with a PSSM is essentially equivalent to threading supplemented with functional information. The presented method may be used to separate functionally important sites from structurally important ones, and thus it may be a useful tool for predicting protein functions.
q-bio.BM:A method to search for local structural similarities in proteins at atomic resolution is presented. It is demonstrated that a huge amount of structural data can be handled within a reasonable CPU time by using a conventional relational database management system with appropriate indexing of geometric data. This method, which we call geometric indexing, can enumerate ligand binding sites that are structurally similar to sub-structures of a query protein among more than 160,000 possible candidates within a few hours of CPU time on an ordinary desktop computer. After detecting a set of high scoring ligand binding sites by the geometric indexing search, structural alignments at atomic resolution are constructed by iteratively applying the Hungarian algorithm, and the statistical significance of the final score is estimated from an empirical model based on a gamma distribution. Applications of this method to several protein structures clearly shows that significant similarities can be detected between local structures of non-homologous as well as homologous proteins.
q-bio.BM:In this paper we enumerate $k$-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures with given minimum stack-length. We show that the numbers of $k$-noncrossing structures without isolated base pairs are significantly smaller than the number of all $k$-noncrossing structures. In particular we prove that the number of 3- and 4-noncrossing RNA structures with stack-length $\ge 2$ is for large $n$ given by $311.2470 \frac{4!}{n(n-1)...(n-4)}2.5881^n$ and $1.217\cdot 10^{7} n^{-{21/2}} 3.0382^n$, respectively. We furthermore show that for $k$-noncrossing RNA structures the drop in exponential growth rates between the number of all structures and the number of all structures with stack-size $\ge 2$ increases significantly. Our results are of importance for prediction algorithms for pseudoknot-RNA and provide evidence that there exist neutral networks of RNA pseudoknot structures.
q-bio.BM:Network science is already making an impact on the study of complex systems and offers a promising variety of tools to understand their formation and evolution (1-4) in many disparate fields from large communication networks (5,6), transportation infrastructures (7) and social communities (8,9) to biological systems (1,10,11). Even though new highthroughput technologies have rapidly been generating large amounts of genomic data, drug design has not followed the same development, and it is still complicated and expensive to develop new single-target drugs. Nevertheless, recent approaches suggest that multi-target drug design combined with a network-dependent approach and large-scale systems-oriented strategies (12-14) create a promising framework to combat complex multigenetic disorders like cancer or diabetes. Here, we investigate the human network corresponding to the interactions between all US approved drugs and human therapies, defined by known drug-therapy relationships. Our results show that the key paths in this network are shorter than three steps, indicating that distant therapies are separated by a surprisingly low number of chemical compounds. We also identify a sub-network composed by drugs with high centrality measures (15), which represent the structural back-bone of the drug-therapy system and act as hubs routing information between distant parts of the network. These findings provide for the first time a global map of the largescale organization of all known drugs and associated therapies, bringing new insights on possible strategies for future drug development. Special attention should be given to drugs which combine the two properties of (a) having a high centrality value and (b) acting on multiple targets.
q-bio.BM:In this paper we enumerate $k$-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures with given minimum arc- and stack-length. That is, we study the numbers of RNA pseudoknot structures with arc-length $\ge 3$, stack-length $\ge \sigma$ and in which there are at most $k-1$ mutually crossing bonds, denoted by ${\sf T}_{k,\sigma}^{[3]}(n)$. In particular we prove that the numbers of 3, 4 and 5-noncrossing RNA structures with arc-length $\ge 3$ and stack-length $\ge 2$ satisfy ${\sf T}_{3,2}^{[3]}(n)^{}\sim K_3 n^{-5} 2.5723^n$, ${\sf T}^{[3]}_{4,2}(n)\sim K_4 n^{-{21/2}} 3.0306^n$, and ${\sf T}^{[3]}_{5,2}(n)\sim K_5 n^{-18} 3.4092^n$, respectively, where $K_3,K_4,K_5$ are constants. Our results are of importance for prediction algorithms for RNA pseudoknot structures.
q-bio.BM:We have developed a new extended replica exchange method to study thermodynamics of a system in the presence of external force. Our idea is based on the exchange between different force replicas to accelerate the equilibrium process. We have shown that the refolding pathways of single ubiquitin depend on which terminus is fixed. If the N-end is fixed then the folding pathways are different compared to the case when both termini are free, but fixing the C-terminal does not change them. Surprisingly, we have found that the anchoring terminal does not affect the pathways of individual secondary structures of three-domain ubiquitin, indicating the important role of the multi-domain construction. Therefore, force-clamp experiments, in which one end of a protein is kept fixed, can probe the refolding pathways of a single free-end ubiquitin if one uses either the poly-ubiquitin or a single domain with the C-terminus anchored. However, it is shown that anchoring one end does not affect refolding pathways of the titin domain I27, and the force-clamp spectroscopy is always capable to predict folding sequencing of this protein. We have obtained the reasonable estimate for unfolding barrier of ubiqutin. The linkage between residue Lys48 and the C-terminal of ubiquitin is found to have the dramatic effect on the location of the transition state along the end-to-end distance reaction coordinate, but the multi-domain construction leaves the transition state almost unchanged. We have found that the maximum force in the force-extension profile from constant velocity force pulling simulations depends on temperature nonlinearly. However, for some narrow temperature interval this dependence becomes linear, as have been observed in recent experiments.
q-bio.BM:A construction method for duplex cage structures with icosahedral sym- metry made out of single-stranded DNA molecules is presented and applied to an icosidodecahedral cage. It is shown via a mixture of analytic and computer techniques that there exist realisations of this graph in terms of two circular DNA molecules. These blueprints for the organisation of a cage structure with a noncrystallographic symmetry may assist in the design of containers made from DNA for applications in nanotechnology.
q-bio.BM:We analyzed folding routes predicted by a variational model in terms of a generalized formalism of the capillarity scaling theory for 28 two-state proteins. The scaling exponent ranged from 0.2 to 0.45 with an average of 0.33. This average value corresponds to packing of rigid objects.That is, on average the folded core of the nucleus is found to be relatively diffuse. We also studied the growth of the folding nucleus and interface along the folding route in terms of the density or packing fraction. The evolution of the folded core and interface regions can be classified into three patterns of growth depending on how the growth of the folded core is balanced by changes in density of the interface. Finally, we quantified the diffuse versus polarized structure of the critical nucleus through direct calculation of the packing fraction of the folded core and interface regions. Our results support the general picture of describing protein folding as the capillarity-like growth of folding nuclei.
q-bio.BM:Biomolecular structures are assemblies of emergent anisotropic building modules such as uniaxial helices or biaxial strands. We provide an approach to understanding a marginally compact phase of matter that is occupied by proteins and DNA. This phase, which is in some respects analogous to the liquid crystal phase for chain molecules, stabilizes a range of shapes that can be obtained by sequence-independent interactions occurring intra- and intermolecularly between polymeric molecules. We present a singularityfree self-interaction for a tube in the continuum limit and show that this results in the tube being positioned in the marginally compact phase. Our work provides a unified framework for understanding the building blocks of biomolecules.
q-bio.BM:The mean time required by a transcription factor (TF) or an enzyme to find a target in the nucleus is of prime importance for the initialization of transcription, gene activation or the start of DNA repair. We obtain new estimates for the mean search time when the TF or enzyme, confined to the cell nucleus, can switch from a one dimensional motion along the DNA and a free Brownian regime inside the crowded nucleus. We give analytical expressions for the mean time the particle stays bound to the DNA, $\tau_{DNA}$, and the mean time it diffuses freely, $\tau_{free}$. Contrary to previous results but in agreement with experimental data, we find a factor $\tau_{DNA} \approx 3.7 \tau_{free}$ for the Lac-I TF. The formula obtained for the time required to bind to a target site is found to be coherent with observed data. We also conclude that a higher DNA density leads to a more efficient search process.
q-bio.BM:We develop coarse-grained models that describe the dynamic encapsidation of functionalized nanoparticles by viral capsid proteins. We find that some forms of cooperative interactions between protein subunits and nanoparticles can dramatically enhance rates and robustness of assembly, as compared to the spontaneous assembly of subunits into empty capsids. For large core-subunit interactions, subunits adsorb onto core surfaces en masse in a disordered manner, and then undergo a cooperative rearrangement into an ordered capsid structure. These assembly pathways are unlike any identified for empty capsid formation. Our models can be directly applied to recent experiments in which viral capsid proteins assemble around the functionalized inorganic nanoparticles [Sun et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (2007) 104, 1354]. In addition, we discuss broader implications for understanding the dynamic encapsidation of single-stranded genomic molecules during viral replication and for developing multicomponent nanostructured materials.
q-bio.BM:The total conformational energy is assumed to consist of pairwise interaction energies between atoms or residues, each of which is expressed as a product of a conformation-dependent function (an element of a contact matrix, C-matrix) and a sequence-dependent energy parameter (an element of a contact energy matrix, E-matrix). Such pairwise interactions in proteins force native C-matrices to be in a relationship as if the interactions are a Go-like potential [N. Go, Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 12. 183 (1983)] for the native C-matrix, because the lowest bound of the total energy function is equal to the total energy of the native conformation interacting in a Go-like pairwise potential. This relationship between C- and E-matrices corresponds to (a) a parallel relationship between the eigenvectors of the C- and E-matrices and a linear relationship between their eigenvalues, and (b) a parallel relationship between a contact number vector and the principal eigenvectors of the C- and E-matrices; the E-matrix is expanded in a series of eigenspaces with an additional constant term, which corresponds to a threshold of contact energy that approximately separates native contacts from non-native ones. These relationships are confirmed in 182 representatives from each family of the SCOP database by examining inner products between the principal eigenvector of the C-matrix, that of the E-matrix evaluated with a statistical contact potential, and a contact number vector. In addition, the spectral representation of C- and E-matrices reveals that pairwise residue-residue interactions, which depends only on the types of interacting amino acids but not on other residues in a protein, are insufficient and other interactions including residue connectivities and steric hindrance are needed to make native structures the unique lowest energy conformations.
q-bio.BM:We consider an elastic rod model for twisted DNA in the plectonemic regime. The molecule is treated as an impenetrable tube with an effective, adjustable radius. The model is solved analytically and we derive formulas for the contact pressure, twisting moment and geometrical parameters of the supercoiled region. We apply our model to magnetic tweezer experiments of a DNA molecule subjected to a tensile force and a torque, and extract mechanical and geometrical quantities from the linear part of the experimental response curve. These reconstructed values are derived in a self-contained manner, and are found to be consistent with those available in the literature.
q-bio.BM:Nicodemi and Prisco recently proposed a model for X-chromosome inactivation in mammals, explaining this phenomenon in terms of a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} 99 (2007), 108104]. Here we provide a mean-field version of their model.
q-bio.BM:We present a theoretical investigation on possible selection of olfactory receptors (ORs) as sensing components of nanobiosensors. Accordingly, we generate the impedance spectra of the rat OR I7 in the native and activated state and analyze their differences. In this way, we connect the protein morphological transformation, caused by the sensing action, with its change of electrical impedance. The results are compared with those obtained by studying the best known protein of the GPCR family: bovine rhodopsin. Our investigations indicate that a change in morphology goes with a change in impedance spectrum mostly associated with a decrease of the static impedance up to about 60 % of the initial value, in qualitative agreement with existing experiments on rat OR I7. The predictiveness of the model is tested successfully for the case of recent experiments on bacteriorhodopsin. The present results point to a promising development of a new class of nanobiosensors based on the electrical properties of GPCR and other sensing proteins.
q-bio.BM:How molecular motors like Kinesin regulates the affinity to the rail protein in the process of ATP hydrolysis remains to be uncovered. To understand the regulation mechanism, we investigate the structural fluctuation of KIF1A in different nucleotide states that are realized in the ATP hydrolysis process by molecular dynamics simulations of Go-like model. We found that "alpha4 helix", which is a part of the microtubule (MT) binding site, changes its fluctuation systematically according to the nucleotide states. In particular, the frequency of large fluctuations of alpha4 strongly correlates with the affinity of KIF1A for microtubule. We also show how the strength of the thermal fluctuation and the interaction with the nucleotide affect the dynamics of microtubule binding site. These results suggest that KIF1A regulates the affinity to MT by changing the flexibility of alpha4 helix according to the nucleotide states.
q-bio.BM:A theoretical framework is developed to study the dynamics of protein folding. The key insight is that the search for the native protein conformation is influenced by the rate r at which external parameters, such as temperature, chemical denaturant or pH, are adjusted to induce folding. A theory based on this insight predicts that (1) proteins with non-funneled energy landscapes can fold reliably to their native state, (2) reliable folding can occur as an equilibrium or out-of-equilibrium process, and (3) reliable folding only occurs when the rate r is below a limiting value, which can be calculated from measurements of the free energy. We test these predictions against numerical simulations of model proteins with a single energy scale.
q-bio.BM:Despite the spontaneity of some in vitro protein folding reactions, native folding in vivo often requires the participation of barrel-shaped multimeric complexes known as chaperonins. Although it has long been known that chaperonin substrates fold upon sequestration inside the chaperonin barrel, the precise mechanism by which confinement within this space facilitates folding remains unknown. In this study, we examine the possibility that the chaperonin mediates a favorable reorganization of the solvent for the folding reaction. We begin by discussing the effect of electrostatic charge on solvent-mediated hydrophobic forces in an aqueous environment. Based on these initial physical arguments, we construct a simple, phenomenological theory for the thermodynamics of density and hydrogen bond order fluctuations in liquid water. Within the framework of this model, we investigate the effect of confinement within a chaperonin-like cavity on the configurational free energy of water by calculating solvent free energies for cavities corresponding to the different conformational states in the ATP- driven catalytic cycle of the prokaryotic chaperonin GroEL. Our findings suggest that one function of chaperonins may be to trap unfolded proteins and subsequently expose them to a micro-environment in which the hydrophobic effect, a crucial thermodynamic driving force for folding, is enhanced.
q-bio.BM:We present a top-down approach to the study of the dynamics of icosahedral virus capsids, in which each protein is approximated by a point mass. Although this represents a rather crude coarse-graining, we argue that it highlights several generic features of vibrational spectra which have been overlooked so far. We furthermore discuss the consequences of approximate inversion symmetry as well as the role played by Viral Tiling Theory in the study of virus capsid vibrations.
q-bio.BM:We study the coupled dynamics of primary and secondary structure formation (i.e. slow genetic sequence selection and fast folding) in the context of a solvable microscopic model that includes both short-range steric forces and and long-range polarity-driven forces. Our solution is based on the diagonalization of replicated transfer matrices, and leads in the thermodynamic limit to explicit predictions regarding phase transitions and phase diagrams at genetic equilibrium. The predicted phenomenology allows for natural physical interpretations, and finds satisfactory support in numerical simulations.
q-bio.BM:We analyze the thermodynamic properties of a simplified model for folded RNA molecules recently studied by G. Vernizzi, H. Orland, A. Zee (in {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 94} (2005) 168103). The model consists of a chain of one-flavor base molecules with a flexible backbone and all possible pairing interactions equally allowed. The spatial pseudoknot structure of the model can be efficiently studied by introducing a $N \times N$ hermitian random matrix model at each chain site, and associating Feynman diagrams of these models to spatial configurations of the molecules. We obtain an exact expression for the topological expansion of the partition function of the system. We calculate exact and asymptotic expressions for the free energy, specific heat, entanglement and chemical potential and study their behavior as a function of temperature. Our results are consistent with the interpretation of $1/N$ as being a measure of the concentration of $\rm{Mg}^{++}$ in solution.
q-bio.BM:Blueprints of polyhedral cages with icosahedral symmetry made of circular DNA molecules are provided. The basic rule is that every edge of the cage is met twice in opposite directions by the DNA strand, and vertex junctions are realised by a set of admissible junction types. As nanocontainers for cargo storage and delivery, the icosidodecahedral cages are of special interest as they have the largest volume per surface ratio of all cages discussed here.
q-bio.BM:Group theoretical arguments combined with normal mode analysis techniques are applied to a coarse-grained approximation of icosahedral viral capsids which incorporates areas of variable flexibility. This highlights a remarkable structure of the low-frequency spectrum in this approximation, namely the existence of a plateau of 24 near zero-modes with universal group theory content.
q-bio.BM:The low-frequency Raman spectra of Na-and Cs-DNA water solutions have been studied to determine the mode of counterion vibrations with respect to phosphate groups of the DNA double helix. The obtained spectra are characterized by the water band near 180 cm-1 and by several DNA bands near 100 cm-1. The main difference between Na- and Cs-DNA spectra is observed in case of the band 100 cm-1. In Cs-DNA spectra this band has about twice higher intensity than in Na-DNA spectra. The comparison of obtained spectra with the calculated frequencies of Na- and Cs-DNA conformational vibrations [Perepelytsya S.M., Volkov S.N. Eur. Phys. J. E. 24, 261 (2007)] show that the band 100 cm-1 in the spectra of Cs-DNA is formed by the modes of both H-bond stretching vibrations and vibrations of caesium counterions, while in Na-DNA spectra the band 100 cm-1 is formed by the mode of H-bond stretching vibrations only. The modes of sodium counterion vibrations have a frequency 180 cm-1, and they do not rise above the water band. Thus, the increase in intensity of the band 100 cm-1 in the spectra of Cs-DNA as compared with Na-DNA is caused by the mode of ion-phosphate vibrations.
q-bio.BM:The Ca-sensitive regulatory switch of cardiac muscle is a paradigmatic example of protein assemblies that communicate ligand binding through allosteric change. The switch is a dimeric complex of troponin C (TnC), an allosteric sensor for Ca, and troponin I (TnI), an allosteric reporter. Time-resolved equilibrium FRET measurements suggest that the switch activates in two steps: a TnI-independent Ca-priming step followed by TnI-dependent opening. To resolve the mechanistic role of TnI in activation we performed stopped-flow FRET measurements of activation following rapid addition of a lacking component (Ca or TnI) and deactivation following rapid chelation of Ca. The time-resolved measurements, stopped-flow measurements, and Ca-titration measurements were globally analyzed in terms of a new quantitative dynamic model of TnC-TnI allostery. The analysis provided a mesoscopic parameterization of distance changes, free energy changes, and transition rates among the accessible coarse-grained states of the system. The results reveal (i) the Ca-induced priming step, which precedes opening, is the rate limiting step in activation, (ii) closing is the rate limiting step in deactivation, (iii) TnI induces opening, (iv) an incompletely deactivated population when regulatory Ca is not bound, which generates an accessory pathway of activation, and (v) incomplete activation by Ca--when regulatory Ca is bound, a 3:2 mixture of dynamically inter-converting open (active) and primed-closed (partially active) conformers is observed (15 C). Temperature-dependent stopped-flow FRET experiments provide a near complete thermo-kinetic parametrization of opening. <Abstract Truncated>
q-bio.BM:We explore the use of a top-down approach to analyse the dynamics of icosahedral virus capsids and complement the information obtained from bottom-up studies of viral vibrations available in the literature. A normal mode analysis based on protein association energies is used to study the frequency spectrum, in which we reveal a universal plateau of low-frequency modes shared by a large class of Caspar-Klug capsids. These modes break icosahedral symmetry and are potentially relevant to the genome release mechanism. We comment on the role of viral tiling theory in such dynamical considerations.
q-bio.BM:In many cases, transcriptional regulation involves the binding of transcription factors at sites on the DNA that are not immediately adjacent to the promoter of interest. This action at a distance is often mediated by the formation of DNA loops: Binding at two or more sites on the DNA results in the formation of a loop, which can bring the transcription factor into the immediate neighborhood of the relevant promoter. Though there have been a variety of insights into the combinatorial aspects of transcriptional control, the mechanism of DNA looping as an agent of combinatorial control in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes remains unclear. We use single-molecule techniques to dissect DNA looping in the lac operon. In particular, we measure the propensity for DNA looping by the Lac repressor as a function of the concentration of repressor protein and as a function of the distance between repressor binding sites. As with earlier single-molecule studies, we find (at least) two distinct looped states and demonstrate that the presence of these two states depends both upon the concentration of repressor protein and the distance between the two repressor binding sites. We find that loops form even at interoperator spacings considerably shorter than the DNA persistence length, without the intervention of any other proteins to prebend the DNA. The concentration measurements also permit us to use a simple statistical mechanical model of DNA loop formation to determine the free energy of DNA looping, or equivalently, the J-factor for looping.
q-bio.BM:We apply a simulational proxy of the phi-value analysis and perform extensive mutagenesis experiments to identify the nucleating residues in the folding reactions of two small lattice Go polymers with different native geometries. These results are compared with those obtained from an accurate analysis based on the reaction coordinate folding probability Pfold, and on structural clustering methods. For both protein models, the transition state ensemble is rather heterogeneous and splits-up into structurally different populations. For the more complex geometry the identified subpopulations are actually structurally disjoint. For the less complex native geometry we found a broad transition state with microscopic heterogeneity. For both geometries, the identification of the folding nucleus via the Pfold analysis agrees with the identification of the folding nucleus carried out with the phi-value analysis. For the most complex geometry, however, the apllied methodologies give more consistent results than for the more local geometry. The study of the transition state' structure reveals that the nucleus residues are not necessarily fully native in the transition state. Indeed, it is only for the more complex geometry that two of the five critical residues show a considerably high probability of having all its native bonds formed in the transition state. Therefore, one concludes that in general the phi-value correlates with the acceleration/deceleration of folding induced by mutation, rather than with the degree of nativeness of the transition state, and that the traditional interpretation of phi-values may provide a more realistic picture of the structure of the transition state only for more complex native geometries.
q-bio.BM:Associative memory Hamiltonian structure prediction potentials are not overly rugged, thereby suggesting their landscapes are like those of actual proteins. In the present contribution we show how basin-hopping global optimization can identify low-lying minima for the corresponding mildly frustrated energy landscapes. For small systems the basin-hopping algorithm succeeds in locating both lower minima and conformations closer to the experimental structure than does molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. For large systems the efficiency of basin-hopping decreases for our initial implementation, where the steps consist of random perturbations to the Cartesian coordinates. We implemented umbrella sampling using basin-hopping to further confirm when the global minima are reached. We have also improved the energy surface by employing bioinformatic techniques for reducing the roughness or variance of the energy surface. Finally, the basin-hopping calculations have guided improvements in the excluded volume of the Hamiltonian, producing better structures. These results suggest a novel and transferable optimization scheme for future energy function development.
q-bio.BM:The performance of single folding predictors and combination scores is critically evaluated. We test mean packing, mean pairwise energy and the new index gVSL2 on a dataset of 743 folded proteins and 81 natively unfolded proteins. These predictors have an individual performance comparable or even better than other proposed methods. We introduce here a strictly unanimous score S_{SU} that combines them but leaves undecided those sequences differently classified by two single predictors. The performance of the single predictors on a dataset purged from the proteins left unclassified by S_{SU}, significantly increases, indicating that unclassified proteins are mainly false predictions. Amino acid composition is the main determinant considered by these predictors, therefore unclassified proteins have a composition compatible with both folded and unfolded status. This is why purging a dataset from these ambiguous proteins increases the performance of single predictors. The percentage of proteins predicted as natively unfolded by S_{SU} in the three kingdoms are: 4.1% for Bacteria, 1.0% for Archaea and 20.0% for Eukarya; compatible with previous determinations. Evidence is given of a scaling law relating the number of natively unfolded proteins with the total number of proteins in a genome; a first estimate of the critical exponent is 1.95 +- 0.21
q-bio.BM:The sequence-dependent structural variability and conformational dynamics of DNA play pivotal roles in many biological milieus, such as in the site-specific binding of transcription factors to target regulatory elements. To better understand DNA structure, function, and dynamics in general, and protein-DNA recognition in the 'kB' family of genetic regulatory elements in particular, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of a 20-base pair DNA encompassing a cognate kB site recognized by the proto-oncogenic 'c-Rel' subfamily of NF-kB transcription factors. Simulations of the kB DNA in explicit water were extended to microsecond duration, providing a broad, atomically-detailed glimpse into the structural and dynamical behavior of double helical DNA over many timescales. Of particular note, novel (and structurally plausible) conformations of DNA developed only at the long times sampled in this simulation -- including a peculiar state arising at ~ 0.7 us and characterized by cross-strand intercalative stacking of nucleotides within a longitudinally-sheared base pair, followed (at ~ 1 us) by spontaneous base flipping of a neighboring thymine within the A-rich duplex. Results and predictions from the us-scale simulation include implications for a dynamical NF-kB recognition motif, and are amenable to testing and further exploration via specific experimental approaches that are suggested herein.
q-bio.BM:The interaction cutoff contribution to the ruggedness of protein-protein energy landscape (the artificial ruggedness) is studied in terms of relative energy fluctuations for 1/r^n potentials based on a simplistic model of a protein complex. Contradicting the principle of minimal frustration, the artificial ruggedness exists for short cutoffs and gradually disappears with the cutoff increase. The critical values of the cutoff were calculated for each of eleven popular power-type potentials with n=0-9, 12 and for two thresholds of 5% and 10%. The artificial ruggedness decreases to tolerable thresholds for cutoffs longer than the critical ones. The results showed that for both thresholds the critical cutoff is a non-monotonic function of the potential power n. The functions reach the maximum at n=3-4 and then decrease with the increase of the potential power. The difference between two cutoffs for 5% and 10% artificial ruggedness becomes negligible for potentials decreasing faster than 1/r^12. The results suggest that cutoffs longer than critical ones can be recommended for protein-protein potentials.
q-bio.BM:Mechanical characterization of protein molecules has played a role on gaining insight into the biological functions of proteins, since some proteins perform the mechanical function. Here, we present the mesoscopic model of biological protein materials composed of protein crystals prescribed by Go potential for characterization of elastic behavior of protein materials. Specifically, we consider the representative volume element (RVE) containing the protein crystals represented by alpha-carbon atoms, prescribed by Go potential, with application of constant normal strain to RVE. The stress-strain relationship computed from virial stress theory provides the nonlinear elastic behavior of protein materials and their mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, quantitatively and/or qualitatively comparable to mechanical properties of biological protein materials obtained from experiments and/or atomistic simulations. Further, we discuss the role of native topology on the mechanical properties of protein crystals. It is shown that parallel strands (hydrogen bonds in parallel) enhances the mechanical resilience of protein materials.
q-bio.BM:Unfolded proteins may contain native or non-native residual structure, which has important implications for the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding as well as for misfolding and aggregation diseases. However, it has been universally accepted that residual structure should not affect the global size scaling of the denatured chain, which obeys the statistics of random coil polymers. Here we use a single-molecule optical technique, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to probe the denatured state of set of repeat proteins containing an increasing number of identical domains, from two to twenty. The availability of this set allows us to obtain the scaling law for the unfolded state of these proteins, which turns out to be unusually compact, strongly deviating from random-coil statistics. The origin of this unexpected behavior is traced to the presence of extensive non-native polyproline II helical structure, which we localize to specific segments of the polypeptide chain. We show that the experimentally observed effects of PPII on the size scaling of the denatured state can be well-described by simple polymer models. Our findings suggest an hitherto unforeseen potential of non-native structure to induce significant compaction of denatured proteins, affecting significantly folding pathways and kinetics.
q-bio.BM:Renaturation and hybridization reactions lead to the pairing of complementary single-stranded nucleic acids. We present here a theoretical investigation of the mechanism of these reactions in vitro under thermal conditions (dilute solutions of single-stranded chains, in the presence of molar concentrations of monovalent salts and at elevated temperatures). The mechanism follows a Kramers' process, whereby the complementary chains overcome a potential barrier through Brownian motion. The barrier originates from a single rate-limiting nucleation event in which the first complementary base pairs are formed. The reaction then proceeds through a fast growth of the double helix. For the DNA of bacteriophages T7, T4 and $\phi$X174 as well as for Escherichia coli DNA, the bimolecular rate $k_2$ of the reaction increases as a power law of the average degree of polymerization $<N>$ of the reacting single- strands: $k_2 \prop <N>^\alpha$. This relationship holds for $100 \leq <N> \leq 50 000$ with an experimentally determined exponent $\alpha = 0.51 \pm 0.01$. The length dependence results from a thermodynamic excluded-volume effect. The reacting single-stranded chains are predicted to be in universal good solvent conditions, and the scaling law is determined by the relevant equilibrium monomer contact probability. The value theoretically predicted for the exponent is $\alpha = 1-\nu \theta_2$, where $\nu$ is Flory's swelling exponent ($nu approx 0.588$) and $\theta_2$ is a critical exponent introduced by des Cloizeaux ($\theta_2 \approx 0.82$), yielding $\alpha = 0.52 \pm 0.01$, in agreement with the experimental results.
q-bio.BM:This article is interested in the origin of the genetic code, it puts forward a scenario of a simultaneous selection of the bases and amino acids and setting up of a correlation between them. Each amino acid is associated with a pair of its own kind, called the binding pair and each binding pair is associated with the codon(s) corresponding to the same amino acid. An explanation is also proposed about the origin of the start and stop codons.
q-bio.BM:We develop equilibrium and kinetic theories that describe the assembly of viral capsid proteins on a charged central core, as seen in recent experiments in which brome mosaic virus (BMV) capsids assemble around nanoparticles functionalized with polyelectrolyte. We model interactions between capsid proteins and nanoparticle surfaces as the interaction of polyelectrolyte brushes with opposite charge, using the nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann equation. The models predict that there is a threshold density of functionalized charge, above which capsids efficiently assemble around nanoparticles, and that light scatter intensity increases rapidly at early times, without the lag phase characteristic of empty capsid assembly. These predictions are consistent with, and enable interpretation of, preliminary experimental data. However, the models predict a stronger dependence of nanoparticle incorporation efficiency on functionalized charge density than measured in experiments, and do not completely capture a logarithmic growth phase seen in experimental light scatter. These discrepancies may suggest the presence of metastable disordered states in the experimental system. In addition to discussing future experiments for nanoparticle-capsid systems, we discuss broader implications for understanding assembly around charged cores such as nucleic acids.
q-bio.BM:The binding of a ligand molecule to a protein is often accompanied by conformational changes of the protein. A central question is whether the ligand induces the conformational change (induced-fit), or rather selects and stabilizes a complementary conformation from a pre-existing equilibrium of ground and excited states of the protein (selected-fit). We consider here the binding kinetics in a simple four-state model of ligand-protein binding. In this model, the protein has two conformations, which can both bind the ligand. The first conformation is the ground state of the protein when the ligand is off, and the second conformation is the ground state when the ligand is bound. The induced-fit mechanism corresponds to ligand binding in the unbound ground state, and the selected-fit mechanism to ligand binding in the excited state. We find a simple, characteristic difference between the on- and off-rates in the two mechanisms if the conformational relaxation into the ground states is fast. In the case of selected-fit binding, the on-rate depends on the conformational equilibrium constant, while the off-rate is independent. In the case of induced-fit binding, in contrast, the off-rate depends on the conformational equilibrium, while the on-rate is independent. Whether a protein binds a ligand via selected-fit or induced-fit thus may be revealed by mutations far from the protein's binding pocket, or other "perturbations" that only affect the conformational equilibrium. In the case of selected-fit, such mutations will only change the on-rate, and in the case of induced-fit, only the off-rate.
q-bio.BM:We study a matrix model of RNA in which an external perturbation acts on n nucleotides of the polymer chain. The effect of the perturbation appears in the exponential generating function of the partition function as a factor $(1-\frac{n\alpha}{L})$ [where $\alpha$ is the ratio of strengths of the original to the perturbed term and L is length of the chain]. The asymptotic behaviour of the genus distribution functions for the extended matrix model are analyzed numerically when (i) $n=L$ and (ii) $n=1$. In these matrix models of RNA, as $n\alpha/L$ is increased from 0 to 1, it is found that the universality of the number of diagrams $a_{L, g}$ at a fixed length L and genus g changes from $3^{L}$ to $(3-\frac{n\alpha}{L})^{L}$ ($2^{L}$ when $n\alpha/L=1$) and the asymptotic expression of the total number of diagrams $\cal N$ at a fixed length L but independent of genus g, changes in the factor $\exp^{\sqrt{L}}$ to $\exp^{(1-\frac{n\alpha}{L})\sqrt{L}}$ ($exp^{0}=1$ when $n\alpha/L=1$)
q-bio.BM:In protein folding the term plasticity refers to the number of alternative folding pathways encountered in response to free energy perturbations such as those induced by mutation. Here we explore the relation between folding plasticity and a gross, generic feature of the native geometry, namely, the relative number of local and non-local native contacts. The results from our study, which is based on Monte Carlo simulations of simple lattice proteins, show that folding to a structure that is rich in local contacts is considerably more plastic than folding to a native geometry characterized by having a very large number of long-range contacts (i.e., contacts between amino acids that are separated by more than 12 units of backbone distance). The smaller folding plasticity of `non-local' native geometries is probably a direct consequence of their higher folding cooperativity that renders the folding reaction more robust against single- and multiple-point mutations.
q-bio.BM:Significant overweight represents a major health problem in industrialized countries. Besides its known metabolic origins, this condition may also have an infectious cause, as recently postulated. Here, it is surmised that the potentially causative adenovirus 36 contributes to such disorder by inactivating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) in a manner reminiscent of a mechanism employed by both another pathogenic adenoviral agent and insulin. The present insight additionally suggests novel modes of interfering with obesity-associated pathology.
q-bio.BM:Biological forces govern essential cellular and molecular processes in all living organisms. Many cellular forces, e.g. those generated in cyclic conformational changes of biological machines, have repetitive components. However, little is known about how proteins process repetitive mechanical stresses. To obtain first insights into dynamic protein mechanics, we probed the mechanical stability of single and multimeric ubiquitins perturbed by periodic forces. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we were able to model repetitive forces with periods about two orders of magnitude longer than the relaxation time of folded ubiquitins. We found that even a small periodic force weakened the protein and shifted its unfolding pathways in a frequency- and amplitude-dependent manner. Our results also showed that the dynamic response of even a small protein can be complex with transient refolding of secondary structures and an increasing importance of local interactions in asymmetric protein stability. These observations were qualitatively and quantitatively explained using an energy landscape model and discussed in the light of dynamic single-molecule measurements and physiological forces. We believe that our approach and results provide first steps towards a framework to better understand dynamic protein biomechanics and biological force generation.
q-bio.BM:It is a standard exercise in mechanical engineering to infer the external forces and torques on a body from its static shape and known elastic properties. Here we apply this kind of analysis to distorted double-helical DNA in complexes with proteins. We extract the local mean forces and torques acting on each base-pair of bound DNA from high-resolution complex structures. Our method relies on known elastic potentials and a careful choice of coordinates of the well-established rigid base-pair model of DNA. The results are robust with respect to parameter and conformation uncertainty. They reveal the complex nano-mechanical patterns of interaction between proteins and DNA. Being non-trivially and non-locally related to observed DNA conformations, base-pair forces and torques provide a new view on DNA-protein binding that complements structural analysis.
q-bio.BM:Molecular dynamics studies within a coarse-grained structure based model were used on two similar proteins belonging to the transcarbamylase family to probe the effects in the native structure of a knot. The first protein, N-acetylornithine transcarbamylase, contains no knot whereas human ormithine transcarbamylase contains a trefoil knot located deep within the sequence. In addition, we also analyzed a modified transferase with the knot removed by the appropriate change of a knot-making crossing of the protein chain. The studies of thermally- and mechanically-induced unfolding processes suggest a larger intrinsic stability of the protein with the knot.
q-bio.BM:Comprehensive knowledge of protein-ligand interactions should provide a useful basis for annotating protein functions, studying protein evolution, engineering enzymatic activity, and designing drugs. To investigate the diversity and universality of ligand binding sites in protein structures, we conducted the all-against-all atomic-level structural comparison of over 180,000 ligand binding sites found in all the known structures in the Protein Data Bank by using a recently developed database search and alignment algorithm. By applying a hybrid top-down-bottom-up clustering analysis to the comparison results, we determined approximately 3000 well-defined structural motifs of ligand binding sites. Apart from a handful of exceptions, most structural motifs were found to be confined within single families or superfamilies, and to be associated with particular ligands. Furthermore, we analyzed the components of the similarity network and enumerated more than 4000 pairs of ligand binding sites that were shared across different protein folds.
q-bio.BM:Protein electrostatic states have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in catalysis, ligand binding, protein stability, and in the modulation of allosteric effects. Electrostatic states are demonstrated to appear conserved among DEAD-box motifs and evidence is presented that the structural changes that occur to DEAD box proteins upon ligand binding alter the DEAD-box motif electrostatics in a way the facilitates the catalytic role of the DEAD-box glutatmate.
q-bio.BM:ESPSim is an open source JAVA program that enables the comparisons of protein electrostatic potential maps via the computation of an electrostatic similarity measure. This program has been utilized to demonstrate a high degree of electrostatic similarity among the potential maps of lysozyme proteins, suggesting that protein electrostatic states are conserved within lysozyme proteins. ESPSim is freely available under the AGPL License from http://www.bioinformatics.org/project/?group_id=830
q-bio.BM:Protein electrostatics have been demonstrated to play a vital role in protein functionality, with many functionally important amino acid residues exhibiting an electrostatic state that is altered from that of a normal amino acid residue. Residues with altered electrostatic states can be identified by the presence of a pKa value that is perturbed by 2 or more pK units, and such residues have been demonstrated to play critical roles in catalysis, ligand binding, and protein stability. Within the HCV helicase and polymerase, as well as the HIV reverse transcriptase, highly conserved regions were demonstrated to possess a greater number and magnitude of perturbations than lesser conserved regions, suggesting that there is an interrelationship present between protein electrostatics and evolution.
q-bio.BM:Protein dynamics in cells may be different from that in dilute solutions in vitro since the environment in cells is highly concentrated with other macromolecules. This volume exclusion due to macromolecular crowding is predicted to affect both equilibrium and kinetic processes involving protein conformational changes. To quantify macromolecular crowding effects on protein folding mechanisms, here we have investigated the folding energy landscape of an alpha/beta protein, apoflavodoxin, in the presence of inert macromolecular crowding agents using in silico and in vitro approaches. By coarse-grained molecular simulations and topology-based potential interactions, we probed the effects of increased volume fraction of crowding agents (phi_c) as well as of crowding agent geometry (sphere or spherocylinder) at high phi_c. Parallel kinetic folding experiments with purified Desulfovibro desulfuricans apoflavodoxin in vitro were performed in the presence of Ficoll (sphere) and Dextran (spherocylinder) synthetic crowding agents. In conclusion, we have identified in silico crowding conditions that best enhance protein stability and discovered that upon manipulation of the crowding conditions, folding routes experiencing topological frustrations can be either enhanced or relieved. The test-tube experiments confirmed that apoflavodoxin's time-resolved folding path is modulated by crowding agent geometry. We propose that macromolecular crowding effects may be a tool for manipulation of protein folding and function in living cells.
q-bio.BM:The force generated between actin and myosin acts predominantly along the direction of the actin filament, resulting in relative sliding of the thick and thin filaments in muscle or transport of myosin cargos along actin tracks. Previous studies have also detected lateral forces or torques that are generated between actin and myosin, but the origin and biological role of these sideways forces is not known. Here we adapt an actin gliding filament assay in order to measure the rotation of an actin filament about its axis (twirling) as it is translocated by myosin. We quantify the rotation by determining the orientation of sparsely incorporated rhodamine-labeled actin monomers, using polarized total internal reflection (polTIRF) microscopy. In order to determine the handedness of the filament rotation, linear incident polarizations in between the standard s- and p-polarizations were generated, decreasing the ambiguity of our probe orientation measurement four-fold. We found that whole myosin II and myosin V both twirl actin with a relatively long (micron), left-handed pitch that is insensitive to myosin concentration, filament length and filament velocity.
q-bio.BM:Most of the theoretical models describing the translocation of a polymer chain through a nanopore use the hypothesis that the polymer is always relaxed during the complete process. In other words, models generally assume that the characteristic relaxation time of the chain is small enough compared to the translocation time that non-equilibrium molecular conformations can be ignored. In this paper, we use Molecular Dynamics simulations to directly test this hypothesis by looking at the escape time of unbiased polymer chains starting with different initial conditions. We find that the translocation process is not quite in equilibrium for the systems studied, even though the translocation time tau is about 10 times larger than the relaxation time tau_r. Our most striking result is the observation that the last half of the chain escapes in less than ~12% of the total escape time, which implies that there is a large acceleration of the chain at the end of its escape from the channel.
q-bio.BM:We present a self-contained theory for the mechanical response of DNA in single molecule experiments. Our model is based on a 1D continuum description of the DNA molecule and accounts both for its elasticity and for DNA-DNA electrostatic interactions. We consider the classical loading geometry used in experiments where one end of the molecule is attached to a substrate and the other one is pulled by a tensile force and twisted by a given number of turns. We focus on configurations relevant to the limit of a large number of turns, which are made up of two phases, one with linear DNA and the other one with superhelical DNA. The model takes into account thermal fluctuations in the linear phase and electrostatic interactions in the superhelical phase. The values of the torsional stress, of the supercoiling radius and angle, and key features of the experimental extension-rotation curves, namely the slope of the linear region and thermal buckling threshold, are predicted. They are found in good agreement with experimental data.
q-bio.BM:While slowly turning the ends of a single molecule of DNA at constant applied force, a discontinuity was recently observed at the supercoiling transition, when a small plectoneme is suddenly formed. This can be understood as an abrupt transition into a state in which stretched and plectonemic DNA coexist. We argue that there should be discontinuities in both the extension and the torque at the transition, and provide experimental evidence for both. To predict the sizes of these discontinuities and how they change with the overall length of DNA, we organize a theory for the coexisting plectonemic state in terms of four length-independent parameters. We also test plectoneme theories, including our own elastic rod simulation, finding discrepancies with experiment that can be understood in terms of the four coexisting state parameters.
q-bio.BM:We introduce a simple "patchy particle" model to study the thermodynamics and dynamics of self-assembly of homomeric protein complexes. Our calculations allow us to rationalize recent results for dihedral complexes. Namely, why evolution of such complexes naturally takes the system into a region of interaction space where (i) the evolutionarily newer interactions are weaker, (ii) subcomplexes involving the stronger interactions are observed to be thermodynamically stable on destabilization of the protein-protein interactions and (iii) the self-assembly dynamics are hierarchical with these same subcomplexes acting as kinetic intermediates.
q-bio.BM:We perform molecular dynamics simulations for a simple coarse-grained model of crambin placed inside of a softly repulsive sphere of radius R. The confinement makes folding at the optimal temperature slower and affects the folding scenarios, but both effects are not dramatic. The influence of crowding on folding are studied by placing several identical proteins within the sphere, denaturing them, and then by monitoring refolding. If the interactions between the proteins are dominated by the excluded volume effects, the net folding times are essentially like for a single protein. An introduction of inter-proteinic attractive contacts hinders folding when the strength of the attraction exceeds about a half of the value of the strength of the single protein contacts. The bigger the strength of the attraction, the more likely is the occurrence of aggregation and misfolding.
q-bio.BM:We have developed a new simulation method to estimate the distance between the native state and the first transition state, and the distance between the intermediate state and the second transition state of a protein which mechanically unfolds via intermediates. Assuming that the end-to-end extension $\Delta R$ is a good reaction coordinate to describe the free energy landscape of proteins subjected to an external force, we define the midpoint extension $\Delta R^*$ between two transition states from either constant-force or constant loading rate pulling simulations. In the former case, $\Delta R^*$ is defined as a middle point between two plateaus in the time-dependent curve of $\Delta R$, while, in the latter one, it is a middle point between two peaks in the force-extension curve. Having determined $\Delta R^*$, one can compute times needed to cross two transition state barriers starting from the native state. With the help of the Bell and microscopic kinetic theory, force dependencies of these unfolding times can be used to locate the intermediate state and to extract unfolding barriers. We have applied our method to the titin domain I27 and the fourth domain of {\em Dictyostelium discoideum} filamin (DDFLN4), and obtained reasonable agreement with experiments, using the C$_{\alpha}$-Go model.
q-bio.BM:The protective effect exerted by polyamines (Put and Spd) against cadmium (Cd) stress was investigated in Brassica juncea plants. Treatment with CdCl2 (75 micro-Mole) resulted in a rise of Cd accumulation, a decrease of fresh and dry weights in every plant organ, an increase of free polyamine content at limb and stem levels as well as a decrease at root level. On the other hand, the total conjugated polyamine levels in the stem tissues were unaffected by Cd. In the leaf tissues, this metal caused a reduction of chlorophyll a content, a rise of guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble glucide, proline and amino acid contents. Exogenous application, by spraying, of putrescine (Put) and spermidine (Spd) to leaf tissues reduced CdCl2-induced stress. These polyamines proved to exert a partial, though significant, protection of the foliar fresh weight and to alleviate the oxidative stress generated by Cd through reductions of MDA amounts and GPOX (E.C.1.11.1.7) activity. The enhancement of chlorophyll a content in plants by Put and those of Chl a and Chl b by Spd both constitute evidences of their efficacy against the Cd2+-induced loss of pigments. Conversely to Put, Spd caused a decrease of Cd content in leave tissues and a rise in the stems and roots; these findings are in favour of a stimulation of Cd uptake by Spd. The proline stimulation observed with Cd was reduced further to the spraying of Put onto tissues, but the decrease induced by Spd was more limited. In the plants treated with Cd, the amino acid contents in the leaves were unaffected by Put and Spd spraying; on the other hand, Cd2+ disturbed polyamine levels (free and acido-soluble conjugated-forms); we notice the rise of total free PAs and the decrease of their conjugated-ones.
q-bio.BM:Three coarse-grained models of the double-stranded DNA are proposed and compared in the context of mechanical manipulation such as twisting and various schemes of stretching. The models differ in the number of effective beads (between two and five) representing each nucleotide. They all show similar behavior and, in particular, lead to a torque-force phase diagrams qualitatively consistent with experiments and all-atom simulations.
q-bio.BM:We incorporate hydrodynamic interactions (HI) in a coarse-grained and structure-based model of proteins by employing the Rotne-Prager hydrodynamic tensor. We study several small proteins and demonstrate that HI facilitate folding. We also study HIV-1 protease and show that HI make the flap closing dynamics faster. The HI are found to affect time correlation functions in the vicinity of the native state even though they have no impact on same time characteristics of the structure fluctuations around the native state.
q-bio.BM:Peptides and proteins exhibit a common tendency to assemble into highly ordered fibrillar aggregates, whose formation proceeds in a nucleation-dependent manner that is often preceded by the formation of disordered oligomeric assemblies. This process has received much attention because disordered oligomeric aggregates have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here we describe a self-templated nucleation mechanism that determines the transition between the initial condensation of polypeptide chains into disordered assemblies and their reordering into fibrillar structures. The results that we present show that at the molecular level this transition is due to the ability of polypeptide chains to reorder within oligomers into fibrillar assemblies whose surfaces act as templates that stabilise the disordered assemblies.
q-bio.BM:The presence of oligomeric aggregates, which is often observed during the process of amyloid formation, has recently attracted much attention since it has been associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We provide a description of a sequence-indepedent mechanism by which polypeptide chains aggregate by forming metastable oligomeric intermediate states prior to converting into fibrillar structures. Our results illustrate how the formation of ordered arrays of hydrogen bonds drives the formation of beta-sheets within the disordered oligomeric aggregates that form early under the effect of hydrophobic forces. Initially individual beta-sheets form with random orientations, which subsequently tend to align into protofilaments as their lengths increases. Our results suggest that amyloid aggregation represents an example of the Ostwald step rule of first order phase transitions by showing that ordered cross-beta structures emerge preferentially from disordered compact dynamical intermediate assemblies.
q-bio.BM:It has been recently argued that the depletion attraction may play an important role in different aspects of the cellular organization, ranging from the organization of transcriptional activity in transcription factories to the formation of the nuclear bodies. In this paper we suggest a new application of these ideas in the context of the splicing process, a crucial step of messanger RNA maturation in Eukaryotes. We shall show that entropy effects and the resulting depletion attraction may explain the relevance of the aspecific intron length variable in the choice of the splice-site recognition modality. On top of that, some qualitative features of the genome architecture of higher Eukaryotes can find an evolutionary realistic motivation in the light of our model.
q-bio.BM:Translocation through a nanopore is a new experimental technique to probe physical properties of biomolecules. A bulk of theoretical and computational work exists on the dependence of the time to translocate a single unstructured molecule on the length of the molecule. Here, we study the same problem but for RNA molecules for which the breaking of the secondary structure is the main barrier for translocation. To this end, we calculate the mean translocation time of single-stranded RNA through a nanopore of zero thickness and at zero voltage for many randomly chosen RNA sequences. We find the translocation time to depend on the length of the RNA molecule with a power law. The exponent changes as a function of temperature and exceeds the naively expected exponent of two for purely diffusive transport at all temperatures. We interpret the power law scaling in terms of diffusion in a one-dimensional energy landscape with a logarithmic barrier.
q-bio.BM:Cellular cargo can be bound to cytoskeletal filaments by one or multiple active or passive molecular motors. Recent experiments have shown that the presence of auxiliary, nondriving motors, results in an enhanced processivity of the cargo, compared to the case of a single active motor alone. We model the observed cooperative transport process using a stochastic model that describes the dynamics of two molecular motors, an active one that moves cargo unidirectionally along a filament track and a passive one that acts as a tether. Analytical expressions obtained from our analysis are fit to experimental data to estimate the microscopic kinetic parameters of our model. Our analysis reveals two qualitatively distinct processivity-enhancing mechanisms: the passive tether can decrease the typical detachment rate of the active motor from the filament track or it can increase the corresponding reattachment rate. Our estimates unambiguously show that in the case of microtubular transport, a higher average run length arises mainly from the ability of the passive motor to keep the cargo close to the filament, enhancing the reattachment rate of an active kinesin motor that has recently detached. Instead, for myosin-driven transport along actin, the passive motor tightly tethers the cargo to the filament, suppressing the detachment rate of the active myosin.
q-bio.BM:FoF1-ATP synthase is the enzyme that provides the 'chemical energy currency' adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for living cells. The formation of ATP is accomplished by a stepwise internal rotation of subunits within the enzyme. Briefly, proton translocation through the membrane-bound Fo part of ATP synthase drives a 10-step rotary motion of the ring of c subunits with respect to the non-rotating subunits a and b. This rotation is transmitted to the gamma and epsilon subunits of the F1 sector resulting in 120 degree steps. In order to unravel this symmetry mismatch we monitor subunit rotation by a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach using three fluorophores specifically attached to the enzyme: one attached to the F1 motor, another one to the Fo motor, and the third one to a non-rotating subunit. To reduce photophysical artifacts due to spectral fluctuations of the single fluorophores, a duty cycle-optimized alternating three-laser scheme (DCO-ALEX) has been developed. Simultaneous observation of the stepsizes for both motors allows the detection of reversible elastic deformations between the rotor parts of Fo and F1.
q-bio.BM:In this paper, we model the mechanics of a collagen pair in the connective tissue extracellular matrix that exists in abundance throughout animals, including the human body. This connective tissue comprises repeated units of two main structures, namely collagens as well as axial, parallel and regular anionic glycosaminoglycan between collagens. The collagen fibril can be modeled by Hooke's law whereas anionic glycosaminoglycan behaves more like a rubber-band rod and as such can be better modeled by the worm-like chain model. While both computer simulations and continuum mechanics models have been investigated the behavior of this connective tissue typically, authors either assume a simple form of the molecular potential energy or entirely ignore the microscopic structure of the connective tissue. Here, we apply basic physical methodologies and simple applied mathematical modeling techniques to describe the collagen pair quantitatively. We find that the growth of fibrils is intimately related to the maximum length of the anionic glycosaminoglycan and the relative displacement of two adjacent fibrils, which in return is closely related to the effectiveness of anionic glycosaminoglycan in transmitting forces between fibrils. These reveal the importance of the anionic glycosaminoglycan in maintaining the structural shape of the connective tissue extracellular matrix and eventually the shape modulus of human tissues. We also find that some macroscopic properties, like the maximum molecular energy and the breaking fraction of the collagen, are also related to the microscopic characteristics of the anionic glycosaminoglycan.
q-bio.BM:The wobble hypothesis does not discriminate between uracil and thymine. Methylation could favor further stabilization of uracil in the keto form. Thymine is present in keto form only and can pair up but with adenine. Uracil can easily construct the enol form; that is why it forms the U-G pair.
q-bio.BM:In this paper we analyze the vibrational spectra of a large ensemble of non-homologous protein structures by means of a novel tool, that we coin the Hierarchical Network Model (HNM). Our coarse-grained scheme accounts for the intrinsic heterogeneity of force constants displayed by protein arrangements and also incorporates side-chain degrees of freedom.   Our analysis shows that vibrational entropy per unit residue correlates with the content of secondary structure. Furthermore, we assess the individual contribution to vibrational entropy of the novel features of our scheme as compared with the predictions of state-of-the-art network models. This analysis highlights the importance of properly accounting for the intrinsic hierarchy in force strengths typical of the different atomic bonds that build up and stabilize protein scaffolds.   Finally, we discuss possible implications of our findings in the context of protein aggregation phenomena.
q-bio.BM:Because of the double-helical structure of DNA, in which two strands of complementary nucleotides intertwine around each other, a covalently closed DNA molecule with no interruptions in either strand can be viewed as two interlocked single-stranded rings. Two closed space curves have long been known by mathematicians to exhibit a property called the linking number, a topologically invariant integer, expressible as the sum of two other quantities, the twist of one of the curves about the other, and the writhing number, or writhe, a measure of the chiral distortion from planarity of one of the two closed curves. We here derive expressions for the twist of supercoiled DNA and the writhe of a closed molecule consistent with the modern view of DNA as a sequence of base-pair steps. Structural biologists commonly characterize the spatial disposition of each step in terms of six rigid-body parameters, one of which, coincidentally, is also called the twist. Of interest is the difference in the mathematical properties between this step-parameter twist and the twist of supercoiling associated with a given base-pair step. For example, it turns out that the latter twist, unlike the former, is sensitive to certain translational shearing distortions of the molecule that are chiral in nature. Thus, by comparing the values for the two twists for each step of a high-resolution structure of a protein-DNA complex, the nucleosome considered here, for example, we may be able to determine how the binding of various proteins contributes to chiral structural changes of the DNA.
q-bio.BM:The AGBNP2 implicit solvent model, an evolution of the Analytical Generalized Born plus Non-Polar (AGBNP) model we have previously reported, is presented with the aim of modeling hydration effects beyond those described by conventional continuum dielectric representations. A new empirical hydration free energy component based on a procedure to locate and score hydration sites on the solute surface is introduced to model first solvation shell effects, such as hydrogen bonding, which are poorly described by continuum dielectric models. This new component is added to the Generalized Born and non-polar AGBNP models which have been improved with respect to the description of the solute volume description. We have introduced an analytical Solvent Excluding Volume (SEV) model which reduces the effect of spurious high-dielectric interstitial spaces present in conventional van der Waals representations of the solute volume. The AGBNP2 model is parametrized and tested with respect to experimental hydration free energies of small molecules and the results of explicit solvent simulations. Modeling the granularity of water is one of the main design principles employed for the the first shell solvation function and the SEV model, by requiring that water locations have a minimum available volume based on the size of a water molecule. We show that the new volumetric model produces Born radii and surface areas in good agreement with accurate numerical evaluations. The results of Molecular Dynamics simulations of a series of mini-proteins show that the new model produces conformational ensembles in substantially better agreement with reference explicit solvent ensembles than the original AGBNP model with respect to both structural and energetics measures.
q-bio.BM:It is presented that the positions of amino acids within Genetic Code Table follow from strict their physical and chemical properties as well as from a pure formal determination by the Golden mean.
q-bio.BM:Although DNA is often bent in vivo, it is unclear how DNA-bending forces modulate DNA-protein binding affinity. Here, we report how a range of DNA-bending forces modulates the binding of the Integration Host Factor (IHF) protein to various DNAs. Using solution fluorimetry and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we measured the affinity of IHF for DNAs with different bending forces and sequence mutations. Bending force was adjusted by varying the fraction of double-stranded DNA in a circular substrate, or by changing the overall size of the circle (1). DNA constructs contained a pair of Forster Resonance Energy Transfer dyes that served as probes for affinity assays, and read out bending forces measured by optical force sensors (2). Small bending forces significantly increased binding affinity; this effect saturated beyond ~3 pN. Surprisingly, when DNA sequences that bound IHF only weakly were mechanically bent by circularization, they bound IHF more tightly than the linear "high-affinity" binding sequence. These findings demonstrate that small bending forces can greatly augment binding at sites that deviate from a protein's consensus binding sequence. Since cellular DNA is subject to mechanical deformation and condensation, affinities of architectural proteins determined in vitro using short linear DNAs may not reflect in vivo affinities.
q-bio.BM:A statistical model of protein families, called profile conditional random fields (CRFs), is proposed. This model may be regarded as an integration of the profile hidden Markov model (HMM) and the Finkelstein-Reva (FR) theory of protein folding. While the model structure of the profile CRF is almost identical to the profile HMM, it can incorporate arbitrary correlations in the sequences to be aligned to the model. In addition, like in the FR theory, the profile CRF can incorporate long-range pairwise interactions between model states via mean-field-like approximations. We give the detailed formulation of the model, self-consistent approximations for treating long-range interactions, and algorithms for computing partition functions and marginal probabilities. We also outline the methods for the global optimization of model parameters as well as a Bayesian framework for parameter learning and selection of optimal alignments.
q-bio.BM:Mathew-Fenn et al. (Science (2008) 322, 446-9) measured end-to-end distances of short DNA and concluded that stretching fluctuations in several consecutive turns of the double helix should be strongly correlated. I argue that this conclusion is based on incorrect assumptions, notably, on a simplistic treatment of the excluded volume effect of reporter labels. Contrary to the author's claim, their conclusion is not supported by other data.
q-bio.BM:The folding dynamics of small single-domain proteins is a current focus of simulations and experiments. Many of these proteins are 'two-state folders', i.e. proteins that fold rather directly from the denatured state to the native state, without populating metastable intermediate states. A central question is how to characterize the instable, partially folded conformations of two-state proteins, in particular the rate-limiting transition-state conformations between the denatured and the native state. These partially folded conformations are short-lived and cannot be observed directly in experiments. However, experimental data from detailed mutational analyses of the folding dynamics provide indirect access to transition states. The interpretation of these data, in particular the reconstruction of transition-state conformations, requires simulation and modeling. The traditional interpretation of the mutational data aims to reconstruct the degree of structure formation of individual residues in the transition state, while a novel interpretation aims at degrees of structure formation of cooperative substructures such as alpha-helices and beta-hairpins. By splitting up mutation-induced free energy changes into secondary and tertiary structural components, the novel interpretation resolves some of the inconsistencies of the traditional interpretation.
q-bio.BM:In Sphingomonas CHY-1, a single ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase is responsible for the initial attack of a range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) composed of up to five rings. The components of this enzyme were separately purified and characterized. The oxygenase component (ht-PhnI) was shown to contain one Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and one mononuclear Fe center per alpha subunit, based on EPR measurements and iron assay. Steady-state kinetic measurements revealed that the enzyme had a relatively low apparent Michaelis constant for naphthalene (Km= 0.92 $\pm$ 0.15 $\mu$M), and an apparent specificity constant of 2.0 $\pm$ 0.3 $\mu$M-1 s-1. Naphthalene was converted to the corresponding 1,2-dihydrodiol with stoichiometric oxidation of NADH. On the other hand, the oxidation of eight other PAHs occurred at slower rates, and with coupling efficiencies that decreased with the enzyme reaction rate. Uncoupling was associated with hydrogen peroxide formation, which is potentially deleterious to cells and might inhibit PAH degradation. In single turnover reactions, ht-PhnI alone catalyzed PAH hydroxylation at a faster rate in the presence of organic solvent, suggesting that the transfer of substrate to the active site is a limiting factor. The four-ring PAHs chrysene and benz[a]anthracene were subjected to a double ring-dihydroxylation, giving rise to the formation of a significant proportion of bis-cis-dihydrodiols. In addition, the dihydroxylation of benz[a]anthracene yielded three dihydrodiols, the enzyme showing a preference for carbons in positions 1,2 and 10,11. This is the first characterization of a dioxygenase able to dihydroxylate PAHs made up of four and five rings.
q-bio.BM:Initial reactions involved in the bacterial degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) include a ring-dihydroxylation catalyzed by a dioxygenase and a subsequent oxidation of the dihydrodiol products by a dehydrogenase. In this study, the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from the PAH-degrading Sphingomonas strain CHY-1 has been characterized. The bphB gene encoding PAH dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (PDDH) was cloned and overexpressed as a His-tagged protein. The recombinant protein was purified as a homotetramer with an apparent Mr of 110,000. PDDH oxidized the cis-dihydrodiols derived from biphenyl and eight polycyclic hydrocarbons, including chrysene, benz[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyene, to corresponding catechols. Remarkably, the enzyme oxidized pyrene 4,5-dihydrodiol, whereas pyrene is not metabolized by strain CHY-1. The PAH catechols produced by PDDH rapidly auto-oxidized in air but were regenerated upon reaction of the o-quinones formed with NADH. Kinetic analyses performed under anoxic conditions revealed that the enzyme efficiently utilized two- to four-ring dihydrodiols, with Km values in the range of 1.4 to 7.1 $\mu$M, and exhibited a much higher Michaelis constant for NAD+ (Km of 160 $\mu$M). At pH 7.0, the specificity constant ranged from (1.3 $\pm$ 0.1) x 106 M?1 s?1 with benz[a]anthracene 1,2-dihydrodiol to (20.0 $\pm$ 0.8) x 106 M?1 s?1 with naphthalene 1,2-dihydrodiol. The catalytic activity of the enzyme was 13-fold higher at pH 9.5. PDDH was subjected to inhibition by NADH and by 3,4-dihydroxyphenanthrene, and the inhibition patterns suggested that the mechanism of the reaction was ordered Bi Bi. The regulation of PDDH activity appears as a means to prevent the accumulation of PAH catechols in bacterial cells.
q-bio.BM:2-Ethyhexyl nitrate (2-EHN) is a major additive of fuel which is used to comply with the cetane number of diesel. Because of its wide use and possible accidental release, 2-EHN is a potential pollutant of the environment. In this study, Mycobacterium austroafricanum IFP 2173 was selected among several strains as the best 2-EHN degrader. The 2-EHN biodegradation rate was increased in biphasic cultures where the hydrocarbon was dissolved in an inert non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL), suggesting that the transfer of the hydrophobic substrate to the cells was a growth-limiting factor. Carbon balance calculation as well as organic carbon measurement indicated a release of metabolites in the culture medium. Further analysis by gas chromatography revealed that a single metabolite accumulated during growth. This metabolite had a molecular mass of 114 Da as determined by GC/MS and was provisionally identified as 4-ethyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one by LC-MS/MS analysis. Identification was confirmed by analysis of the chemically synthesized lactone. Based on these results, a plausible catabolic pathway is proposed whereby 2-EHN is converted to 4-ethyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one, which cannot be metabolised further by strain IFP 2173. This putative pathway provides an explanation for the low energetic efficiency of 2-EHN degradation and its poor biodegradability.
q-bio.BM:In this study, the genes involved in the initial attack on fluorene by Sphingomonas sp. LB126 were investigated. The ? and ? subunits of a dioxygenase complex (FlnA1A2), showing 63% and 51% sequence identity respectively, with the subunits of an angular dioxygenase from Gram-positive Terrabacter sp. DBF63, were identified. When overexpressed in E. coli, FlnA1A2 was responsible for the angular oxidation of fluorene, fluorenol, fluorenone, dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin. Moreover, FlnA1A2 was able to oxidize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heteroaromatics, some of which were not oxidized by the dioxygenase from Terrabacter sp. DBF63. Quantification of resulting oxidation products showed that fluorene and phenanthrene were preferred substrates.
q-bio.BM:We study a simplified model of the RNA molecule proposed by G. Vernizzi, H. Orland and A. Zee in the regime of strong concentration of positive ions in solution. The model considers a flexible chain of equal bases that can pairwise interact with any other one along the chain, while preserving the property of saturation of the interactions. In the regime considered, we observe the emergence of a critical temperature T_c separating two phases that can be characterized by the topology of the predominant configurations: in the large temperature regime, the dominant configurations of the molecule have very large genera (of the order of the size of the molecule), corresponding to a complex topology, whereas in the opposite regime of low temperatures, the dominant configurations are simple and have the topology of a sphere. We determine that this topological phase transition is of first order and provide an analytic expression for T_c. The regime studied for this model exhibits analogies with that for the dense polymer systems studied by de Gennes
q-bio.BM:The kinetics for the assembly of viral proteins into a population of capsids can be measured in vitro with size exclusion chromatography or dynamic light scattering, but extracting mechanistic information from these studies is challenging. For example, it is not straightforward to determine the critical nucleus size or the elongation time (the time required for a nucleated partial capsid to grow completion). We show that, for two theoretical models of capsid assembly, the critical nucleus size can be determined from the concentration dependence of the assembly reaction half-life and the elongation time is revealed by the length of the lag phase. Furthermore, we find that the system becomes kinetically trapped when nucleation becomes fast compared to elongation. Implications of this constraint for determining elongation mechanisms from experimental assembly data are discussed.
q-bio.BM:Single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments are used to infer the properties of the denatured state ensemble (DSE) of proteins. From the measured average FRET efficiency, <E>, the distance distribution P(R) is inferred by assuming that the DSE can be described as a polymer. The single parameter in the appropriate polymer model (Gaussian chain, Wormlike chain, or Self-avoiding walk) for P(R) is determined by equating the calculated and measured <E>. In order to assess the accuracy of this "standard procedure," we consider the generalized Rouse model (GRM), whose properties [<E> and P(R)] can be analytically computed, and the Molecular Transfer Model for protein L for which accurate simulations can be carried out as a function of guanadinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) concentration. Using the precisely computed <E> for the GRM and protein L, we infer P(R) using the standard procedure. We find that the mean end-to-end distance can be accurately inferred (less than 10% relative error) using <E> and polymer models for P(R). However, the value extracted for the radius of gyration (Rg) and the persistence length (lp) are less accurate. The relative error in the inferred R-g and lp, with respect to the exact values, can be as large as 25% at the highest GdmCl concentration. We propose a self-consistency test, requiring measurements of <E> by attaching dyes to different residues in the protein, to assess the validity of describing DSE using the Gaussian model. Application of the self-consistency test to the GRM shows that even for this simple model the Gaussian P(R) is inadequate. Analysis of experimental data of FRET efficiencies for the cold shock protein shows that at there are significant deviations in the DSE P(R) from the Gaussian model.
q-bio.BM:The high computational cost of carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of even small-size proteins is a major obstacle in the study, at atomic detail and in explicit solvent, of the physical mechanism which is at the basis of the folding of proteins. Making use of a biasing algorithm, based on the principle of the ratchet-and-pawl, we have been able to calculate eight folding trajectories (to an RMSD between 1.2A and 2.5A) of the B1 domain of protein G in explicit solvent without the need of high-performance computing. The simulations show that in the denatured state there is a complex network of cause-effect relationships among contacts, which results in a rather hierarchical folding mechanism. The network displays few local and nonlocal native contacts which are cause of most of the others, in agreement with the NOE signals obtained in mildly-denatured conditions. Also nonnative contacts play an active role in the folding kinetics. The set of conformations corresponding to the transition state display phi-values with a correlation coefficient of 0.69 with the experimental ones. They are structurally quite homogeneous and topologically native-like, although some of the side chains and most of the hydrogen bonds are not in place.
q-bio.BM:Rigidity analysis using the "pebble game" has been applied to protein crystal structures to obtain information on protein folding, assembly and t he structure-function relationship. However, previous work using this technique has not made clear how the set of hydrogen-bond constraints included in the rigidity analysis should be chosen, nor how sensitive the results of rigidity analysis are to small structural variations. We present a comparative study in which "pebble game" rigidity analysis is applied to multiple protein crystal structures, for each of six differen t protein families. We find that the mainchain rigidity of a protein structure at a given hydrogen-bond energy cutoff is quite sensitive to small structural variations, and conclude that the hydrogen bond constraints in rigidity analysis should be chosen so as to form and test specific hypotheses about the rigidity o f a particular protein. Our comparative approach highlights two different characteristic patterns ("sudden" or "gradual") for protein rigidity loss as constraints are re moved, in line with recent results on the rigidity transitions of glassy networks.
q-bio.BM:We carry out a theoretical study on the isotropic-nematic phase transition and phase separation in amyloid fibril solutions. Borrowing the thermodynamic model employed in the study of cylindrical micelles, we investigate the variations in the fibril length distribution and phase behavior with respect to changes in the protein concentration, fibril's rigidity, and binding energy. We then relate our theoretical findings to the nematic ordering observed in Hen Lysozyme fibril solution.
q-bio.BM:Homeodomain containing proteins are a broad class of DNA binding proteins that are believed to primarily function as transcription factors. Electrostatics interactions have been demonstrated to be critical for the binding of the homeodomain to DNA. An examination of the electrostatic state of homeodomain residues involved in DNA phosphate binding has demonstrated the conserved presence of upward shifted pKa values among the basic residue of lysine and arginine. It is believed that these pKa perturbations work to facilitate binding to DNA since they ensure that the basic residues always retain a positive charge.
q-bio.BM:2D display is a fast and economical way of visualizing polymorphism and comparing genomes, which is based on the separation of DNA fragments in two steps, according first to their size and then to their sequence composition. In this paper, we present an exhaustive study of the numerical issues associated with a model aimed at predicting the final absolute locations of DNA fragments in 2D display experiments. We show that simple expressions for the mobility of DNA fragments in both dimensions allow one to reproduce experimental final absolute locations to better than experimental uncertainties. On the other hand, our simulations also point out that the results of 2D display experiments are not sufficient to determine the best set of parameters for the modeling of fragments separation in the second dimension and that additional detailed measurements of the mobility of a few sequences are necessary to achieve this goal. We hope that this work will help in establishing simulations as a powerful tool to optimize experimental conditions without having to perform a large number of preliminary experiments and to estimate whether 2D DNA display is suited to identify a mutation or a genetic difference that is expected to exist between the genomes of closely related organisms.
q-bio.BM:Proteins are large and complex molecular machines. In order to perform their function, most of them need energy, e.g. either in the form of a photon, like in the case of the visual pigment rhodopsin, or through the breaking of a chemical bond, as in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Such energy, in turn, has to be transmitted to specific locations, often several tens of Angstroms away from where it is initially released. Here we show, within the framework of a coarse-grained nonlinear network model, that energy in a protein can jump from site to site with high yields, covering in many instances remarkably large distances. Following single-site excitations, few specific sites are targeted, systematically within the stiffest regions. Such energy transfers mark the spontaneous formation of a localized mode of nonlinear origin at the destination site, which acts as an efficient energy-accumulating centre. Interestingly, yields are found to be optimum for excitation energies in the range of biologically relevant ones.
q-bio.BM:A protein undergoes conformational dynamics with multiple time scales, which results in fluctuating enzyme activities. Recent studies in single molecule enzymology have observe this "age-old" dynamic disorder phenomenon directly. However, the single molecule technique has its limitation. To be able to observe this molecular effect with real biochemical functions {\it in situ}, we propose to couple the fluctuations in enzymatic activity to noise propagations in small protein interaction networks such as zeroth order ultra-sensitive phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. We showed that enzyme fluctuations could indeed be amplified by orders of magnitude into fluctuations in the level of substrate phosphorylation | a quantity widely interested in cellular biology. Enzyme conformational fluctuations sufficiently slower than the catalytic reaction turn over rate result in a bimodal concentration distribution of the phosphorylated substrate. In return, this network amplified single enzyme fluctuation can be used as a novel biochemical "reporter" for measuring single enzyme conformational fluctuation rates.
q-bio.BM:The microtubule assembly process has been extensively studied, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. The structure of an artificially generated sheet polymer that alternates two types of lateral contacts and that directly converts into microtubules, has been proposed to correspond to the intermediate sheet structure observed during microtubule assembly. We have studied the self-assembly process of GMPCPP tubulins into sheet and microtubule structures using thermodynamic analysis and stochastic simulations. With the novel assumptions that tubulins can laterally interact in two different forms, and allosterically affect neighboring lateral interactions, we can explain existing experimental observations. At low temperature, the allosteric effect results in the observed sheet structure with alternating lateral interactions as the thermodynamically most stable form. At normal microtubule assembly temperature, our work indicates that a class of sheet structures resembling those observed at low temperature is transiently trapped as an intermediate during the assembly process. This work may shed light on the tubulin molecular interactions, and the role of sheet formation during microtubule assembly.
q-bio.BM:Metamorphic proteins like Lymphotactin are a notable exception of the empirical principle that structured natural proteins possess a unique three dimensional structure. In particular, the human chemokine lymphotactin protein (Ltn) exists in two distinct conformations (one monomeric and one dimeric) under physiological conditions. In this work we use a Ca Go-model to show how this very peculiar behavior can be reproduced. From the study of the thermodynamics and of the kinetics we characterize the interconversion mechanism. In particular, this takes place through the docking of the two chains living in a third monomeric, partially unfolded, state which shows a residual structure involving a set of local contacts common to the two native conformations. The main feature of two-fold proteins appears to be the sharing of a common set of local contacts between the two distinct folds as confirmed by the study of two designed two-fold proteins. Metamorphic proteins may be more common than expected.
q-bio.BM:Computing the similarity between two protein structures is a crucial task in molecular biology, and has been extensively investigated. Many protein structure comparison methods can be modeled as maximum clique problems in specific k-partite graphs, referred here as alignment graphs. In this paper, we propose a new protein structure comparison method based on internal distances (DAST) which is posed as a maximum clique problem in an alignment graph. We also design an algorithm (ACF) for solving such maximum clique problems. ACF is first applied in the context of VAST, a software largely used in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and then in the context of DAST. The obtained results on real protein alignment instances show that our algorithm is more than 37000 times faster than the original VAST clique solver which is based on Bron & Kerbosch algorithm. We furthermore compare ACF with one of the fastest clique finder, recently conceived by Ostergard. On a popular benchmark (the Skolnick set) we observe that ACF is about 20 times faster in average than the Ostergard's algorithm.
q-bio.BM:We use computer simulations to study a model, first proposed by Wales [1], for the reversible and monodisperse self-assembly of simple icosahedral virus capsid structures. The success and efficiency of assembly as a function of thermodynamic and geometric factors can be qualitatively related to the potential energy landscape structure of the assembling system. Even though the model is strongly coarse-grained, it exhibits a number of features also observed in experiments, such as sigmoidal assembly dynamics, hysteresis in capsid formation and numerous kinetic traps. We also investigate the effect of macromolecular crowding on the assembly dynamics. Crowding agents generally reduce capsid yields at optimal conditions for non-crowded assembly, but may increase yields for parameter regimes away from the optimum. Finally, we generalize the model to a larger triangulation number T = 3, and observe more complex assembly dynamics than that seen for the original T = 1 model.
q-bio.BM:Why reaction rate constants for enzymatic reactions are typically inversely proportional to fractional power exponents of solvent viscosity remains to be already a thirty years old puzzle. Available interpretations of the phenomenon invoke to either a modification of 1. the conventional Kramers' theory or that of 2. the Stokes law. We show that there is an alternative interpretation of the phenomenon at which neither of these modifications is in fact indispensable. We reconcile 1. and 2. with the experimentally observable dependence. We assume that an enzyme solution in solvent with or without cosolvent molecules is an ensemble of samples with different values of the viscosity for the movement of the system along the reaction coordinate. We assume that this viscosity consists of the contribution with the weight $q$ from cosolvent molecules and that with the weight $1-q$ from protein matrix and solvent molecules. We introduce heterogeneity in our system with the help of a distribution over the weight $q$. We verify the obtained solution of the integral equation for the unknown function of the distribution by direct substitution. All parameters of the model are related to experimentally observable values. General formalism is exemplified by the analysis of literature experimental data for oxygen escape from hemerythin.
q-bio.BM:A simple explanation for the symmetry and degeneracy of the genetic code has been suggested. An alternative to the wobble hypothesis has been proposed. This hypothesis offers explanations for: i) the difference between thymine and uracil, ii) encoding of tryptophan by only one codon, iii) why E. coli have no inosine in isoleucine tRNA, but isoleucine is encoded by three codons. The facts revealed in this study offer a new insight into physical mechanisms of the functioning of the genetic code.
q-bio.BM:A new theoretical survey of proteins' resistance to constant speed stretching is performed for a set of 17 134 proteins as described by a structure-based model. The proteins selected have no gaps in their structure determination and consist of no more than 250 amino acids. Our previous studies have dealt with 7510 proteins of no more than 150 amino acids. The proteins are ranked according to the strength of the resistance. Most of the predicted top-strength proteins have not yet been studied experimentally. Architectures and folds which are likely to yield large forces are identified. New types of potent force clamps are discovered. They involve disulphide bridges and, in particular, cysteine slipknots. An effective energy parameter of the model is estimated by comparing the theoretical data on characteristic forces to the corresponding experimental values combined with an extrapolation of the theoretical data to the experimental pulling speeds. These studies provide guidance for future experiments on single molecule manipulation and should lead to selection of proteins for applications. A new class of proteins, involving cystein slipknots, is identified as one that is expected to lead to the strongest force clamps known. This class is characterized through molecular dynamics simulations.
q-bio.BM:We have developed a generalized semi-analytic approach for efficiently computing cyclization and looping $J$ factors of DNA under arbitrary binding constraints. Many biological systems involving DNA-protein interactions impose precise boundary conditions on DNA, which necessitates a treatment beyond the Shimada-Yamakawa model for ring cyclization. Our model allows for DNA to be treated as a heteropolymer with sequence-dependent intrinsic curvature and stiffness. In this framework, we independently compute enthlapic and entropic contributions to the $J$ factor and show that even at small length scales $(\sim \ell_{p})$ entropic effects are significant. We propose a simple analytic formula to describe our numerical results for a homogenous DNA in planar loops, which can be used to predict experimental cyclization and loop formation rates as a function of loop size and binding geometry. We also introduce an effective torsional persistence length that describes the coupling between twist and bending of DNA when looped.
q-bio.BM:We use the Dominant Reaction Pathway (DRP) approach to study the dynamics of the folding of a beta-hairpin, within a model which accounts for both native and non-native interactions. We compare the most probable folding pathways calculated with the DRP method with those obtained directly from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We find that the two approaches give completely consistent results. We investigate the effects of the non-native hydrophobic interactions on the folding dynamics found them to be small.
q-bio.BM:Mechanical unfolding of the fourth domain of Distyostelium discoideum filamin (DDFLN4) was studied in detail using the C$_{\alpha}$-Go model. We show that unfolding pathways of this protein depend on the pulling speed. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results on the sequencing of unfolding events is achieved at low loading rates. The unfolding free energy landscape is also constructed using dependencies of unfolding forces on pulling speeds.
q-bio.BM:Mechanical unfolding of the fourth domain of Distyostelium discoideum filamin (DDFLN4) was studied by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, using the GROMOS96 force field 43a1 and the simple point charge explicit water solvent. Our study reveals an important role of non-native interactions in the unfolding process. Namely, the existence of a peak centered at the end-to-end extension 22 nm in the force-extension curve, is associated with breaking of non-native hydrogen bonds. Such a peak has been observed in experiments but not in Go models, where non-native interactions are neglected. We predict that an additional peak occurs at 2 nm using not only GROMOS96 force field 43a1 but also Amber 94 and OPLS force fields. This result would stimulate further experimental studies on elastic properties of DDFLN4.
q-bio.BM:With the aid of quantum mechanical calculations we investigate the electronic structure of the full length (FL) potassium channel protein, FL-KcsA, in its closed conformation, and the electronic structure of the ClC chloride channel. The results indicate that both ion channels are strongly polarized towards the extracellular region with respect to the membrane mean plane. FL-KcsA possesses an electric dipole moment of magnitude 403 Debye while ClC has a macrodipole whose magnitude is about five times larger, 1983 Debye, thereby contributing to differentiate their membrane electric barriers. The dipole vectors of both proteins are aligned along the corresponding selectivity filters. This result suggests that potassium and chloride ion channels are not passive with respect to the movement of ions across the membrane and the ionic motion might be partially driven by the electric field of the protein in conjunction with the electrochemical potential of the membrane.
q-bio.BM:We show that minuscule entropic forces, on the order of 100 fN, can prevent the formation of DNA loops--a ubiquitous means of regulating the expression of genes. We observe a tenfold decrease in the rate of LacI-mediated DNA loop formation when a tension of 200 fN is applied to the substrate DNA, biasing the thermal fluctuations that drive loop formation and breakdown events. Conversely, once looped, the DNA-protein complex is insensitive to applied force. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a simple polymer model of loop formation in DNA, and show that an anti-parallel topology is the preferred LacI-DNA loop conformation for a generic loop-forming construct.
q-bio.BM:The Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) is a rapidly growing repository for the dissemination of structural data from single-particle reconstructions of supramolecular protein assemblies including motors, chaperones, cytoskeletal assemblies, and viral capsids. While the static structure of these assemblies provides essential insight into their biological function, their conformational dynamics and mechanics provide additional important information regarding the mechanism of their biological function. Here, we present an unsupervised computational framework to analyze and store for public access the conformational dynamics of supramolecular protein assemblies deposited in the EMDB. Conformational dynamics are analyzed using normal mode analysis in the finite element framework, which is used to compute equilibrium thermal fluctuations, cross-correlations in molecular motions, and strain energy distributions for 452 of the 681 entries stored in the EMDB at present. Results for the viral capsid of hepatitis B, ribosome-bound termination factor RF2, and GroEL are presented in detail and validated with all-atom based models. The conformational dynamics of protein assemblies in the EMDB may be useful in the interpretation of their biological function, as well as in the classification and refinement of EM-based structures.
q-bio.BM:The dynamical characterization of proteins is crucial to understand protein function. From a microscopic point of view, protein dynamics is governed by the local atomic interactions that, in turn, trigger the functional conformational changes. Unfortunately, the relationship between local atomic fluctuations and global protein rearrangements is still elusive. Here, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with complex network analysis show that fast peptide relaxations effectively build the backbone of the global free-energy landscape, providing a connection between local and global atomic rearrangements. A minimum-spanning-tree representation, built on the base of transition gradients networks, results in a high resolution mapping of the system dynamics and thermodynamics without requiring any a priori knowledge of the relevant degrees of freedom. These results suggest the presence of a local mechanism for the high communication efficiency generally observed in complex systems.
q-bio.BM:The functional correlation of missense mutations which cause disease remains a challenge to understanding the basis of genetic diseases. This is particularly true for proteins related to diseases for which there are no available three dimensional structures. One such disease is Shwachman Diamond syndrome SDS OMIM 260400, a multi system disease arising from loss of functional mutations. The Homo sapiens Shwachman Bodian Diamond Syndrome gene hSBDS is responsible for SDS. hSBDS is expressed in all tissues and encodes a protein of 250 amino acids SwissProt accession code Q9Y3A5. Sequence analysis of disease associated alleles has identified more than 20 different mutations in affected individuals. While a number of these mutations have been described as leading to the loss of protein function due to truncation, translation or surface epitope association, the structural basis for these mutations has yet to be determined due to the lack of a three-dimensional structure for SBDS.
q-bio.BM:Using the perturbation-response scanning (PRS) technique, we study a set of 23 proteins that display a variety of conformational motions upon ligand binding (e.g. shear, hinge, allosteric). In most cases, PRS determines residues that may be manipulated to achieve the resulting conformational change. PRS reveals that for some proteins, binding induced conformational change may be achieved through the perturbation of residues scattered throughout the protein, whereas in others, perturbation of specific residues confined to a highly specific region are necessary. Correlations between the experimental and calculated atomic displacements are always better or equivalent to those obtained from a modal analysis of elastic network models. Furthermore, best correlations obtained by the latter approach do not always appear in the most collective modes. We show that success of the modal analysis depends on the lack of redundant paths that exist in the protein. PRS thus demonstrates that several relevant modes may simultaneously be induced by perturbing a single select residue on the protein. We also illustrate the biological relevance of applying PRS on the GroEL and ADK structures in detail, where we show that the residues whose perturbation lead to the precise conformational changes usually correspond to those experimentally determined to be functionally important.
q-bio.BM:Living cells provide a fluctuating, out-of-equilibrium environment in which genes must coordinate cellular function. DNA looping, which is a common means of regulating transcription, is very much a stochastic process; the loops arise from the thermal motion of the DNA and other fluctuations of the cellular environment. We present single-molecule measurements of DNA loop formation and breakdown when an artificial fluctuating force, applied to mimic a fluctuating cellular environment, is imposed on the DNA. We show that loop formation is greatly enhanced in the presence of noise of only a fraction of $k_B T$, yet find that hypothetical regulatory schemes that employ mechanical tension in the DNA--as a sensitive switch to control transcription--can be surprisingly robust due to a fortuitous cancellation of noise effects.
q-bio.BM:Capsids of many viruses assemble around nucleic acids or other polymers. Understanding how the properties of the packaged polymer affect the assembly process could promote biomedical efforts to prevent viral assembly or nanomaterials applications that exploit assembly. To this end, we simulate on a lattice the dynamical assembly of closed, hollow shells composed of several hundred to 1000 subunits, around a flexible polymer. We find that assembly is most efficient at an optimum polymer length that scales with the surface area of the capsid; significantly longer than optimal polymers often lead to partial-capsids with unpackaged polymer `tails' or a competition between multiple partial-capsids attached to a single polymer. These predictions can be tested with bulk experiments in which capsid proteins assemble around homopolymeric RNA or synthetic polyelectrolytes. We also find that the polymer can increase the net rate of subunit accretion to a growing capsid both by stabilizing the addition of new subunits and by enhancing the incoming flux of subunits; the effects of these processes may be distinguishable with experiments that monitor the assembly of individual capsids.
q-bio.BM:We study the control parameters that govern the dynamics of in vitro DNA ejection in bacteriophage lambda. Past work has demonstrated that bacteriophage DNA is highly pressurized; this pressure has been hypothesized to help drive DNA ejection. Ions influence this process by screening charges on DNA; however, a systematic variation of salt concentrations to explore these effects has not been undertaken. To study the nature of the forces driving DNA ejection, we performed in vitro measurements of DNA ejection in bulk and at the single-phage level. We present measurements on the dynamics of ejection and on the self-repulsion force driving ejection. We examine the role of ion concentration and identity in both measurements, and show that the charge of counter-ions is an important control parameter. These measurements show that the frictional force acting on the ejecting DNA is subtly dependent on ionic concentrations for a given amount of DNA in the capsid. We also present evidence that phage DNA forms loops during ejection; we confirm that this effect occurs using optical tweezers. We speculate this facilitates circularization of the genome in the cytoplasm.
q-bio.BM:A relationship between the preexponent of the rate constant and the distribution over activation barrier energies for enzymatic/protein reactions is revealed. We consider an enzyme solution as an ensemble of individual molecules with different values of the activation barrier energy described by the distribution. From the solvent viscosity effect on the preexponent we derive the integral equation for the distribution and find its approximate solution. Our approach enables us to attain a twofold purpose. On the one hand it yields a simple interpretation of the solvent viscosity dependence for enzymatic/protein reactions that requires neither a modification of the Kramers' theory nor that of the Stokes law. On the other hand our approach enables us to deduce the form of the distribution over activation barrier energies. The obtained function has a familiar bell-shaped form and is in qualitative agreement with the results of single enzyme kinetics measurements. General formalism is exemplified by the analysis of literature experimental data.
q-bio.BM:A molecular-level model is used to study the mechanical response of empty cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) capsids. The model is based on the native structure of the proteins that consitute the capsids and is described in terms of the C-alpha atoms. Nanoindentation by a large tip is modeled as compression between parallel plates. Plots of the compressive force versus plate separation for CCMV are qualitatively consistent with continuum models and experiments, showing an elastic region followed by an irreversible drop in force. The mechanical response of CPMV has not been studied, but the molecular model predicts an order of magnitude higher stiffness and a much shorter elastic region than for CCMV. These large changes result from small structural changes that increase the number of bonds by only 30% and would be difficult to capture in continuum models. Direct comparison of local deformations in continuum and molecular models of CCMV shows that the molecular model undergoes a gradual symmetry breaking rotation and accommodates more strain near the walls than the continuum model. The irreversible drop in force at small separations is associated with rupturing nearly all of the bonds between capsid proteins in the molecular model while a buckling transition is observed in continuum models.
q-bio.BM:Using lattice models we explore the factors that determine the tendencies of polypeptide chains to aggregate by exhaustively sampling the sequence and conformational space. The morphologies of the fibril-like structures and the time scales ($\tau_{fib}$) for their formation depend on a subtle balance between hydrophobic and coulomb interactions. The extent of population of a fibril-prone structure in the spectrum of monomer conformations is the major determinant of $\tau_{fib}$. This observation is used to determine the aggregation-prone consensus sequences by exhaustively exploring the sequence space. Our results provide a basis for genome wide search of fragments that are aggregation prone.
q-bio.BM:Cancer is a proliferation disease affecting a genetically unstable cell population, in which molecular alterations can be somatically inherited by genetic, epigenetic or extragenetic transmission processes, leading to a cooperation of neoplastic cells within tumoral tissue. The efflux protein P-glycoprotein (P gp) is overexpressed in many cancer cells and has known capacity to confer multidrug resistance to cytotoxic therapies. Recently, cell-to-cell P-gp transfers have been shown. Herein, we combine experimental evidence and a mathematical model to examine the consequences of an intercellular P-gp trafficking in the extragenetic transfer of multidrug resistance from resistant to sensitive cell subpopulations. We report cell-to-cell transfers of functional P-gp in co-cultures of a P-gp overexpressing human breast cancer MCF-7 cell variant, selected for its resistance towards doxorubicin, with the parental sensitive cell line. We found that P-gp as well as efflux activity distribution are progressively reorganized over time in co-cultures analyzed by flow cytometry. A mathematical model based on a Boltzmann type integro-partial differential equation structured by a continuum variable corresponding to P-gp activity describes the cell populations in co-culture. The mathematical model elucidates the population elements in the experimental data, specifically, the initial proportions, the proliferative growth rates, and the transfer rates of P-gp in the sensitive and resistant subpopulations. We confirmed cell-to-cell transfer of functional P-gp. The transfer process depends on the gradient of P-gp expression in the donor-recipient cell interactions, as they evolve over time. Extragenetically acquired drug resistance is an additional aptitude of neoplastic cells which has implications in the diagnostic value of P-gp expression and in the design of chemotherapy regimens
q-bio.BM:We discuss the appropriate techniques for modelling the geometry of open ended elastic polymer molecules. The molecule is assumed to have fixed endpoints on a boundary surface. In particular we discuss the concept of the winding number, a directional measure of the linking of two curves, which can be shown to be invariant to the set of continuous deformations vanishing at the polymer's end-point and which forbid it from passing through itself. This measure is shown to be the appropriate constraint required to evaluate the geometrical properties of a constrained DNA molecule. Using the net winding measure we define a model of an open ended constrained DNA molecule which combines the necessary constraint of self-avoidance with being analytically tractable. This model builds upon the local models of Bouchiat and Mezard (2000). In particular, we present a new derivation of the polar writhe expression, which detects both the local winding of the curve and non local winding between different sections of the curve. We then show that this expression correctly tracks the net twisting of a DNA molecule subject to rotation at the endpoints, unlike other definitions used in the literature.
q-bio.BM:The electronic structure of charybdotoxin (ChTX), a scorpion venom peptide that is known to act as a potassium channel blocker, is investigated with the aid of quantum mechanical calculations. The dipole moment vector (145 D) of ChTX can be stirred by the full length KcsA potassium channel's macrodipole (403 D) thereby assuming the proper orientation before binding the ion channel on the cell surface. The localization of the frontier orbitals of ChTX has been revealed for the first time. HOMO is localized on Trp14 while the three lowest-energy MOs (LUMO, LUMO+1, and LUMO+2) are localized on the three disulfide bonds that characterize this pepetide. An effective way to engineer the HOMO-LUMO (H-L) gap of ChTX is that of replacing its Trp14 residue with Ala14 whereas deletion of the LUMO-associated disulfide bond with the insertion of a pair of L-alpha-aminobutyric acid residues does not affect the H-L energy gap.
q-bio.BM:We propose a mechanism that explains in a simple and natural form the l-homochiralization of prebiotic aminoacids in a volume of water where a geothermal gradient exists.
q-bio.BM:The coat proteins of many viruses spontaneously form icosahedral capsids around nucleic acids or other polymers. Elucidating the role of the packaged polymer in capsid formation could promote biomedical efforts to block viral replication and enable use of capsids in nanomaterials applications. To this end, we perform Brownian dynamics on a coarse-grained model that describes the dynamics of icosahedral capsid assembly around a flexible polymer. We identify several mechanisms by which the polymer plays an active role in its encapsulation, including cooperative polymer-protein motions. These mechanisms are related to experimentally controllable parameters such as polymer length, protein concentration, and solution conditions. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate that assembly mechanisms are correlated to encapsulation efficiency, and we present a phase diagram that predicts assembly outcomes as a function of experimental parameters. We anticipate that our simulation results will provide a framework for designing in vitro assembly experiments on single-stranded RNA virus capsids.
q-bio.BM:The assumption of linear response of protein molecules to thermal noise or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment, is broadly used in the studies of protein dynamics. Conformational motions in proteins are traditionally analyzed in terms of normal modes and experimental data on thermal fluctuations in such macromolecules is also usually interpreted in terms of the excitation of normal modes. We have chosen two important protein motors - myosin V and kinesin KIF1A - and performed numerical investigations of their conformational relaxation properties within the coarse-grained elastic network approximation. We have found that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations. The deficiency is particularly pronounced in KIF1A where the normal mode description fails completely in describing functional mechanochemical motions. These results indicate that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered. Neither a single normal mode, nor a superposition of such modes yield an approximation of strongly nonlinear dynamics.
q-bio.BM:We perform a quantum mechanical study of the peptides that are part of the LH2 complex from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila, a non-sulfur purple bacteria that has the ability of producing chemical energy from photosynthesis. The electronic structure calculations indicate that the transmembrane helices of these peptides are characterized by dipole moments with a magnitude of ~150 D. When the full nonamer assembly made of eighteen peptides is considered, then a macrodipole of magnitude 704 D is built up from the vector sum of each monomer dipole. The macrodipole is oriented normal to the membrane plane and with the positive tip toward the cytoplasm thereby indicating that the electronic charge of the protein scaffold is polarized toward the periplasm. The results obtained here suggest that the asymmetric charge distribution of the protein scaffold contributes an anisotropic electrostatic environment which differentiates the absorption properties of the bacteriochlorophyll pigments, B800 and B850, embedded in the LH2 complex.
q-bio.BM:The approach for calculation of the mode intensities of DNA conformational vibrations in the Raman spectra is developed. It is based on the valence-optic theory and the model for description of conformational vibrations of DNA with counterions. The calculations for Na- and Cs-DNA low-frequency Raman spectra show that the vibrations of DNA backbone chains near 15 cm-1 have the greatest intensity. In the spectrum of Na-DNA at frequency range upper than 40 cm-1 the modes of H-bond stretching in base pairs have the greatest intensities, while the modes of ion-phosphate vibrations have the lowest intensity. In Cs-DNA spectra at this frequency range the mode of ion-phosphate vibrations is prominent. Its intensity is much higher than the intensities of Na-DNA modes of this spectra range. Other modes of Cs-DNA have much lower intensities than in the case of Na-DNA. The comparison of our calculations with the experimental data shows that developed approach gives the understanding of the sensitivity of DNA low-frequency Raman bands to the neutralization of the double helix by light and heavy counterions.
q-bio.BM:The protein folding is regarded as a quantum transition between torsion states on polypeptide chain. The deduction of the folding rate formula in our previous studies is reviewed. The rate formula is generalized to the case of frequency variation in folding. Then the following problems about the application of the rate theory are discussed: 1) The unified theory on the two-state and multi-state protein folding is given based on the concept of quantum transition. 2) The relationship of folding and unfolding rates vs denaturant concentration is studied. 3) The temperature dependence of folding rate is deduced and the non-Arrhenius behaviors of temperature dependence are interpreted in a natural way. 4) The inertial moment dependence of folding rate is calculated based on the model of dynamical contact order and consistent results are obtained by comparison with one-hundred-protein experimental dataset. 5) The exergonic and endergonic foldings are distinguished through the comparison between theoretical and experimental rates for each protein. The ultrafast folding problem is viewed from the point of quantum folding theory and a new folding speed limit is deduced from quantum uncertainty relation. And finally, 6) since only the torsion-accessible states are manageable in the present formulation of quantum transition how the set of torsion-accessible states can be expanded by using statistical energy landscape approach is discussed. All above discussions support the view that the protein folding is essentially a quantum transition between conformational states.
q-bio.BM:Homologous recombination plays a key role in generating genetic diversity, while maintaining protein functionality. The mechanisms by which RecA enables a single-stranded segment of DNA to recognize a homologous tract within a whole genome are poorly understood. The scale by which homology recognition takes place is of a few tens of base pairs, after which the quest for homology is over. To study the mechanism of homology recognition, RecA-promoted homologous recombination between short DNA oligomers with different degrees of heterology was studied in vitro, using fluorescence resonant energy transfer. RecA can detect single mismatches at the initial stages of recombination, and the efficiency of recombination is strongly dependent on the location and distribution of mismatches. Mismatches near the 5' end of the incoming strand have a minute effect, whereas mismatches near the 3' end hinder strand exchange dramatically. There is a characteristic DNA length above which the sensitivity to heterology decreases sharply. Experiments with competitor sequences with varying degrees of homology yield information about the process of homology search and synapse lifetime. The exquisite sensitivity to mismatches and the directionality in the exchange process support a mechanism for homology recognition that can be modeled as a kinetic proofreading cascade.
q-bio.BM:Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) such as HIV's trans-activating transcriptional activator (TAT) and polyarginine rapidly pass through the plasma membranes of mammalian cells by an unknown mechanism called transduction. They may be medically useful when fused to well-chosen chains of fewer than about 35 amino acids. I offer a simple model of transduction in which phosphatidylserines and CPPs effectively form two plates of a capacitor with a voltage sufficient to cause the formation of transient pores (electroporation). The model is consistent with experimental data on the transduction of oligoarginine into mouse C2-C12 myoblasts and makes three testable predictions.
q-bio.BM:In recent years, single molecule force techniques have opened a new avenue to decipher the folding landscapes of biopolymers by allowing us to watch and manipulate the dynamics of individual proteins and nucleic acids. In single molecule force experiments, quantitative analyses of measurements employing sound theoretical models and molecular simulations play central role more than any other field. With a brief description of basic theories for force mechanics and molecular simulation technique using self-organized polymer (SOP) model, this chapter will discuss various issues in single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments, which include pulling speed dependent unfolding pathway, measurement of energy landscape roughness, the in uence of molecular handles in optical tweezers on measurement and molecular motion, and folding dynamics of biopolymers under force quench condition.
q-bio.BM:We explore in detail the structural, mechanical and thermodynamic properties of a coarse-grained model of DNA similar to that introduced in Thomas E. Ouldridge, Ard A. Louis, Jonathan P.K. Doye, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 178101 (2010). Effective interactions are used to represent chain connectivity, excluded volume, base stacking and hydrogen bonding, naturally reproducing a range of DNA behaviour. We quantify the relation to experiment of the thermodynamics of single-stranded stacking, duplex hybridization and hairpin formation, as well as structural properties such as the persistence length of single strands and duplexes, and the torsional and stretching stiffness of double helices. We also explore the model's representation of more complex motifs involving dangling ends, bulged bases and internal loops, and the effect of stacking and fraying on the thermodynamics of the duplex formation transition.
q-bio.BM:In this and the associated article 'BioBlender: A Software for Intuitive Representation of Surface Properties of Biomolecules', (Andrei et al) we present BioBlender as a complete instrument for the elaboration of motion (here) and the visualization (Andrei et al) of proteins and other macromolecules, using instruments of computer graphics. A vast number of protein (if not most) exert their function through some extent of motion. Despite recent advances in higly performant methods, it is very difficult to obtain direct information on conformational changes of molecules. However, several systems exist that can shed some light on the variability of conformations of a single peptide chain; among them, NMR methods provide collections of a number of static 'shots' of a moving protein. Starting from this data, and assuming that if a protein exists in more than 1 conformation it must be able to transit between the different states, we have elaborated a system that makes ample use of the computational power of 3D computer graphics technology. Considering information of all (heavy) atoms, we use animation and game engine of Blender to obtain transition states. The model we chose to elaborate our system is Calmodulin, a protein favorite among structural and dynamic studies due to its (relative) simplicity of structure and small dimension. Using Calmodulin we show a procedure that enables the building of a 'navigation map' of NMR models, that can help in the identification of movements. In the process, a number of intermediate conformations is generated, all of which respond to strict bio-physical and bio-chemical criteria. The BioBlender system is available for download from the website www.bioblender.net, together with examples, tutorial and other useful material.
q-bio.BM:Nested sampling is a Bayesian sampling technique developed to explore probability distributions lo- calised in an exponentially small area of the parameter space. The algorithm provides both posterior samples and an estimate of the evidence (marginal likelihood) of the model. The nested sampling algo- rithm also provides an efficient way to calculate free energies and the expectation value of thermodynamic observables at any temperature, through a simple post-processing of the output. Previous applications of the algorithm have yielded large efficiency gains over other sampling techniques, including parallel tempering (replica exchange). In this paper we describe a parallel implementation of the nested sampling algorithm and its application to the problem of protein folding in a Go-type force field of empirical potentials that were designed to stabilize secondary structure elements in room-temperature simulations. We demonstrate the method by conducting folding simulations on a number of small proteins which are commonly used for testing protein folding procedures: protein G, the SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. A topological analysis of the posterior samples is performed to produce energy landscape charts, which give a high level description of the potential energy surface for the protein folding simulations. These charts provide qualitative insights into both the folding process and the nature of the model and force field used.
q-bio.BM:The electrochemical behaviour of the biomedical and metallic alloys, especially in the orthopaedic implants fields, raises many questions. This study is dedicated for studying the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS, in various physiological media,: Ringer solution, phosphate buffered solution (PBS), PBS solution and albumin, PBS solution with calf serum and PBS solution with calf serum and an antioxidant (sodium azide). Moreover, the desionised water was considered as the reference solution. The tests reproducibility was investigated. The time-frequency-Module graphs highlighted that the desionised water is the most protective for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. This biomedical alloy is the less protected in the solution constituted by PBS and albumin. The time-frequency graph allows pointing out the graphic signatures of adsorption for organic and inorganic species (differences between the modules means in studied solution and the modules mean in the reference solution). --- Le comportement \'electrochimique des alliages m\'etalliques biom\'edicaux, notamment dans le domaine des implants orthop\'ediques, pose encore de nombreuses questions. Ce travail propose d'\'etudier l'alliage de titane Ti-6Al-4V, par spectroscopie d'imp\'edance \'electrochimique, SIE, dans diff\'erents milieux physiologiques : solution de Ringer, solution \`a base d'un tampon phosphate (PBS), solution PBS avec de l'albumine, solution PBS avec du s\'erum bovin et une solution PBS avec du s\'erum bovin et un antioxydant (azoture de sodium).

q-bio.BM:We present a rigidity analysis on a large number of X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme HIV-1 protease using the 'pebble game' algorithm of the software FIRST. We find that although the rigidity profile remains similar across a comprehensive set of high resolution structures, the profile changes significantly in the presence of an inhibitor. Our study shows that the action of the inhibitors is to restrict the flexibility of the beta-hairpin flaps which allow access to the active site. The results are discussed in the context of full molecular dynamics simulations as well as data from NMR experiments.
q-bio.BM:Conventional kinesin is a two-headed homodimeric motor protein, which is able to walk along microtubules processively by hydrolyzing ATP. Its neck linkers, which connect the two motor domains and can undergo a docking/undocking transition, are widely believed to play the key role in the coordination of the chemical cycles of the two motor domains and, consequently, in force production and directional stepping. Although many experiments, often complemented with partial kinetic modeling of specific pathways, support this idea, the ultimate test of the viability of this hypothesis requires the construction of a complete kinetic model. Considering the two neck linkers as entropic springs that are allowed to dock to their head domains and incorporating only the few most relevant kinetic and structural properties of the individual heads, here we develop the first detailed, thermodynamically consistent model of kinesin that can (i) explain the cooperation of the heads (including their gating mechanisms) during walking and (ii) reproduce much of the available experimental data (speed, dwell time distribution, randomness, processivity, hydrolysis rate, etc.) under a wide range of conditions (nucleotide concentrations, loading force, neck linker length and composition, etc.). Besides revealing the mechanism by which kinesin operates, our model also makes it possible to look into the experimentally inaccessible details of the mechanochemical cycle and predict how certain changes in the protein affect its motion.
q-bio.BM:Fifteen years ago Monique Tirion showed that the low-frequency normal modes of a protein are not significantly altered when non-bonded interactions are replaced by Hookean springs, for all atom pairs whose distance is smaller than a given cutoff value. Since then, it has been shown that coarse-grained versions of Tirion's model are able to provide fair insights on many dynamical properties of biological macromolecules. In this text, theoretical tools required for studying these so-called Elastic Network Models are described, focusing on practical issues and, in particular, on possible artifacts. Then, an overview of some typical results that have been obtained by studying such models is given.
q-bio.BM:A recent survey of 17 134 proteins has identified a new class of proteins which are expected to yield stretching induced force-peaks in the range of 1 nN. Such high force peaks should be due to forcing of a slip-loop through a cystine ring, i.e. by generating a cystine slipknot. The survey has been performed in a simple coarse grained model. Here, we perform all-atom steered molecular dynamics simulations on 15 cystine knot proteins and determine their resistance to stretching. In agreement with previous studies within a coarse grained structure based model, the level of resistance is found to be substantially higher than in proteins in which the mechanical clamp operates through shear. The large stretching forces arise through formation of the cystine slipknot mechanical clamp and the resulting steric jamming. We elucidate the workings of such a clamp in an atomic detail. We also study the behavior of five top strength proteins with the shear-based mechanostability in which no jamming is involved. We show that in the atomic model, the jamming state is relieved by moving one amino acid at a time and there is a choice in the selection of the amino acid that advances the first. In contrast, the coarse grained model also allows for a simultaneous passage of two amino acids.
q-bio.BM:A quantum theory on conformation-electron system is presented. Protein folding is regarded as the quantum transition between torsion states on polypeptide chain, and the folding rate is calculated by nonadiabatic operator method. The theory is used to study the temperature dependences of folding rate of 15 proteins and their non-Arrhenius behavior can all be deduced in a natural way. A general formula on the rate-temperature dependence has been deduced which is in good accordance with experimental data. These temperature dependences are further analyzed in terms of torsion potential parameters. Our results show it is necessary to move outside the realm of classical physics when the temperature dependence of protein folding is studied quantitatively.
q-bio.BM:Lasso peptides constitute a class of bioactive peptides sharing a knotted structure where the C-terminal tail of the peptide is threaded through and trapped within an N-terminalmacrolactamring. The structural characterization of lasso structures and differentiation from their unthreaded topoisomers is not trivial and generally requires the use of complementary biochemical and spectroscopic methods. Here we investigated two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the class II lasso peptide family and their corresponding unthreaded topoisomers: microcin J25 (MccJ25), which is known to yield two-peptide product ions specific of the lasso structure under collisioninduced dissociation (CID), and capistruin, for which CID does not permit to unambiguously assign the lasso structure. The two pairs of topoisomers were analyzed by electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR MS) upon CID, infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD), and electron capture dissociation (ECD). CID and ECDspectra clearly permitted to differentiate MccJ25 from its non-lasso topoisomer MccJ25-Icm, while for capistruin, only ECD was informative and showed different extent of hydrogen migration (formation of c\bullet/z from c/z\bullet) for the threaded and unthreaded topoisomers. The ECD spectra of the triply-charged MccJ25 and MccJ25-lcm showed a series of radical b-type product ions {\eth}b0In{\TH}. We proposed that these ions are specific of cyclic-branched peptides and result from a dual c/z\bullet and y/b dissociation, in the ring and in the tail, respectively. This work shows the potentiality of ECD for structural characterization of peptide topoisomers, as well as the effect of conformation on hydrogen migration subsequent to electron capture.
q-bio.BM:Nanospray and collisionally-induced dissociation are used to evaluate the presence and absence of interstrand co-chelation of zinc ions in dimers of metallothionein. As was reported in a previous publication from this laboratory, co-chelation stabilizes the dimer to collisional activation, and facilitates asymmetrical zinc ion transfers during fragmentation. In the case of metallothionein, dimers of the holoprotein are found to share zinc ions, while dimers of metallothionein, in which one domain has been denatured, do not. Zinc ions are silent to most physicochemical probes, e.g., NMR and Mossbauer spectroscopies, and the capability of mass spectrometry to provide information on zinc complexes has widespread potential application in biochemistry.
q-bio.BM:Polymers can be modeled as open polygonal paths and their closure generates knots. Knotted proteins detection is currently achieved via high-throughput methods based on a common framework insensitive to the handedness of knots. Here we propose a topological framework for the computation of the HOMFLY polynomial, an handedness-sensitive invariant. Our approach couples a multi-component reduction scheme with the polynomial computation. After validation on tabulated knots and links the framework was applied to the entire Protein Data Bank along with a set of selected topological checks that allowed to discard artificially entangled structures. This led to an up-to-date table of knotted proteins that also includes two newly detected right-handed trefoil knots in recently deposited protein structures. The application range of our framework is not limited to proteins and it can be extended to the topological analysis of biological and synthetic polymers and more generally to arbitrary polygonal paths.
q-bio.BM:Atomic-accuracy structure prediction of macromolecules is a long-sought goal of computational biophysics. Accurate modeling should be achievable by optimizing a physically realistic energy function but is presently precluded by incomplete sampling of a biopolymer's many degrees of freedom. We present herein a working hypothesis, called the "stepwise ansatz", for recursively constructing well-packed atomic-detail models in small steps, enumerating several million conformations for each monomer and covering all build-up paths. By implementing the strategy in Rosetta and making use of high-performance computing, we provide first tests of this hypothesis on a benchmark of fifteen RNA loop modeling problems drawn from riboswitches, ribozymes, and the ribosome, including ten cases that were not solvable by prior knowledge based modeling approaches. For each loop problem, this deterministic stepwise assembly (SWA) method either reaches atomic accuracy or exposes flaws in Rosetta's all-atom energy function, indicating the resolution of the conformational sampling bottleneck. To our knowledge, SWA is the first enumerative, ab initio build-up method to systematically outperform existing Monte Carlo and knowledge-based methods for 3D structure prediction. As a rigorous experimental test, we have applied SWA to a small RNA motif of previously unknown structure, the C7.2 tetraloop/tetraloop-receptor, and stringently tested this blind prediction with nucleotide-resolution structure mapping data.
q-bio.BM:The surface accessibility of {\alpha}-bungarotoxin has been investigated by using Gd2L7, a newly designed paramagnetic NMR probe. Signal attenuations induced by Gd2L7 on {\alpha}-bungarotoxin C{\alpha}H peaks of 1H-13C HSQC spectra have been analyzed and compared with the ones previously obtained in the presence of GdDTPA-BMA. In spite of the different molecular size and shape, for the two probes a common pathway of approach to the {\alpha}-bungarotoxin surface can be observed with an equally enhanced access of both GdDTPA-BMA and Gd2L7 towards the protein surface side where the binding site is located. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that protein backbone flexibility and surface hydration contribute to the observed preferential approach of both gadolinium complexes specifically to the part of the {\alpha}-bungarotoxin surface which is involved in the interaction with its physiological target, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
q-bio.BM:The rates of protein folding with photon absorption or emission and the cross section of photon -protein inelastic scattering are calculated from the quantum folding theory by use of standard field-theoretical method. All these protein photo-folding processes are compared with common protein folding without interaction of photons (nonradiative folding). It is demonstrated that there exists a common factor (thermo-averaged overlap integral of vibration wave function, TAOI) for protein folding and protein photo-folding. Based on this finding it is predicted that: 1) the stimulated photo-folding rates show the same temperature dependence as protein folding; 2) the spectral line of electronic transition is broadened to a band which includes abundant vibration spectrum without and with conformational transition and the width of the vibration spectral line is largely reduced; 3) the resonance fluorescence cross section changes with temperature obeying the same law (Luo-Lu's law). The particular form of the folding rate - temperature relation and the abundant spectral structure imply the existence of a set of quantum oscillators in the transition process and these oscillators are mainly of torsion type of low frequency, imply the quantum tunneling between protein conformations does exist in folding and photo-folding processes and the tunneling is rooted deeply in the coherent motion of the conformational-electronic system.
q-bio.BM:In this paper we will review various aspects of the biology of prions and focus on what is currently known about the mammalian PrP prion. Also we briefly describe the prions of yeast and other fungi. Prions are infectious proteins behaving like genes, i.e. proteins that not only contain genetic information in its tertiary structure, i.e. its shape, but are also able to transmit and replicate in a manner analogous to genes but through very different mechanisms. The term prion is derived from "proteinaceous infectious particle" and arose from the Prusiner hypothesis that the infectious agent of certain neurodegenerative diseases was only in a protein, without the participation of nucleic acids. Currently there are several known types of prion, in addition to the originally described, which are pathogens of mammals, yeast and other fungi. Prion proteins are ubiquitous and not always detrimental to their hosts. This vision of the prion as a causative agent of disease is changing, finding more and more evidence that they could have important roles in cells and contribute to the phenotypic plasticity of organisms through the mechanisms of evolution.
q-bio.BM:Genomic DNA is constantly subjected to various mechanical stresses arising from its biological functions and cell packaging. If the local mechanical properties of DNA change under torsional and tensional stress, the activity of DNA-modifying proteins and transcription factors can be affected and regulated allosterically. To check this possibility, appropriate steady forces and torques were applied in the course of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of DNA with AT- and GC-alternating sequences. It is found that the stretching rigidity grows with tension as well as twisting. The torsional rigidity is not affected by stretching, but it varies with twisting very strongly, and differently for the two sequences. Surprisingly, for AT-alternating DNA it passes through a minimum with the average twist close to the experimental value in solution. For this fragment, but not for the GC-alternating sequence, the bending rigidity noticeably changes with both twisting and stretching. The results have important biological implications and shed light upon earlier experimental observations.
q-bio.BM:The 3'-monofunctional adduct of cisplatin and d(CTCTG*G*TCTC)2 duplex DNA in solvent with explicit counter ions and water molecules were subjected to MD- simulation with AMBER force field on a nanosecond time scale. In order to simulate the closure of the bond between the Pt and 5'-guanine-N7 atoms, the forces acting between them were gradually increased during MD. After 500-800 ps the transformation of the mono-adduct (straight DNA with the cisplatin residue linked to one guanine-N7) to the bus-adduct (bent DNA where Pt atom is connected through the N7 atoms of neighboring guanines) was observed. A cavity between palatinate guanines is formed and filled with solvent molecules. The rapid inclination of the center base pairs initiates a slow transition of the whole molecule from the linear to the bent conformation. After about 1000-1300 ps a stable structure was reached, which is very similar to the one described experimentally. The attractive force between the Pt- atom and the N7 of the second guanine plays the main role in the large conformational changes induced by formation of the adduct-adduct. X-N-Pt-N-torsions accelerate the bending but a torsion force constant greater than 0.2 Kcal/mol lead to the breaking of the H-bonds within the base pairs. The present study is the first dynamical simulation that demonstrates in real time scale such a large conformational perturbation of DNA.
q-bio.BM:Despite the recognized importance of the multi-scale spatio-temporal organization of proteins, most computational tools can only access a limited spectrum of time and spatial scales, thereby ignoring the effects on protein behavior of the intricate coupling between the different scales. Starting from a physico-chemical atomistic network of interactions that encodes the structure of the protein, we introduce a methodology based on multi-scale graph partitioning that can uncover partitions and levels of organization of proteins that span the whole range of scales, revealing biological features occurring at different levels of organization and tracking their effect across scales. Additionally, we introduce a measure of robustness to quantify the relevance of the partitions through the generation of biochemically-motivated surrogate random graph models. We apply the method to four distinct conformations of myosin tail interacting protein, a protein from the molecular motor of the malaria parasite, and study properties that have been experimentally addressed such as the closing mechanism, the presence of conserved clusters, and the identification through computational mutational analysis of key residues for binding.
q-bio.BM:In this work two archaea microorganisms (Haloferax volcanii and Natrialba magadii) used as biocatalyst at a microbial fuel cell (MFC) anode were evaluated. Both archaea are able to grow at high salt concentrations. By increasing the media conductivity, the internal resistance was diminished, improving the MFCs performance. Without any added redox mediator, maximum power (Pmax) and current at Pmax were 11.87 / 4.57 / 0.12 {\mu}W cm-2 and 49.67 / 22.03 / 0.59 {\mu}A cm-2 for H. volcanii, N. magadii and E. coli, respectively. When neutral red was used as redox mediator, Pmax was 50.98 and 5.39 {\mu}W cm-2 for H. volcanii and N. magadii respectively. In this paper an archaea MFC is described and compared with other MFC systems; the high salt concentration assayed here, comparable with that used in Pt-catalyzed alkaline hydrogen fuel cells will open new options when MFC scaling-up is the objective, necessary for practical applications.
q-bio.BM:Three-dimensional RNA models fitted into crystallographic density maps exhibit pervasive conformational ambiguities, geometric errors and steric clashes. To address these problems, we present enumerative real-space refinement assisted by electron density under Rosetta (ERRASER), coupled to Python-based hierarchical environment for integrated 'xtallography' (PHENIX) diffraction-based refinement. On 24 data sets, ERRASER automatically corrects the majority of MolProbity-assessed errors, improves the average Rfree factor, resolves functionally important discrepancies in noncanonical structure and refines low-resolution models to better match higher-resolution models.
q-bio.BM:This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a missing figure
q-bio.BM:We develop a theory of aggregation using statistical mechanical methods. An example of a complicated aggregation system with several levels of structures is peptide/protein self-assembly. The problem of protein aggregation is important for the understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and also for the development of bio-macromolecules as new materials. We write the effective Hamiltonian in terms of interaction energies between protein monomers, protein and solvent, as well as between protein filaments. The grand partition function can be expressed in terms of a Zimm-Bragg-like transfer matrix, which is calculated exactly and all thermodynamic properties can be obtained. We start with two-state and three-state descriptions of protein monomers using Potts models that can be generalized to include q-states, for which the exactly solvable feature of the model remains. We focus on n X N lattice systems, corresponding to the ordered structures observed in some real fibrils. We have obtained results on nucleation processes and phase diagrams, in which a protein property such as the sheet content of aggregates is expressed as a function of the number of proteins on the lattice and inter-protein or interfacial interaction energies. We have applied our methods to A{\beta}(1-40) and Curli fibrils and obtained results in good agreement with experiments.
q-bio.BM:By studying the literature about Tetracyclines (TCs), it becomes clearly evident that TCs are very dynamic molecules. In some cases, their structure-activity-relationship (SAR) are known, especially against bacteria, while against other targets, they are virtually unknown. In other diverse yields of research, such as neurology, oncology and virology the utility and activity of the tetracyclines are being discovered and are also emerging as new technological fronts. The first aim of this paper is classify the compounds already used in therapy and prepare the schematic structure in which include the next generation of TCs. The aim of this work is introduce a new framework for the classification of old and new TCs, using a medicinal chemistry approach to the structure of that drugs. A fully documented Structure-Activity-Relationship (SAR) is presented with the analysis data of antibacterial and nonantibacterial (antifungal, antiviral and anticancer) tetracyclines. Lipophilicity of functional groups and conformations interchangeably are determining rules in biological activities of TCs.
q-bio.BM:The consequences of recent experimental finding that hydrogen bonds of the anti-parallel $\beta $-sheet in nonspecific binding site of serine proteases become significantly shorter and stronger synchronously with the catalytic act are examined. We investigate the effect of the transformation of an ordinary hydrogen bond into a low-barrier one on the crankshaft motion a peptide group in the anti-parallel $\beta $-sheet. For this purpose we make use of a realistic model of the peptide chain with stringent microscopically derived coupling interaction potential and effective on-site potential. The coupling interaction characterizing the peptide chain rigidity is found to be surprisingly weak and repulsive in character. The effective on-site potential is found to be a hard one, i.e., goes more steep than a harmonic one. At transformation of the ordinary hydrogen bond into the low-barrier one the frequency of crankshaft motion of the corresponding peptide group in the anti-parallel $\beta $-sheet is roughly doubled.
q-bio.BM:During this era of new drug designing, medicinal plants had become a very interesting object of further research. Pharmacology screening of active compound of medicinal plants would be time consuming and costly. Molecular docking is one of the in silico method which is more efficient compare to in vitro or in vivo method for its capability of finding the active compound in medicinal plants. In this method, three-dimensional structure becomes very important in the molecular docking methods, so we need a database that provides information on three-dimensional structures of chemical compounds from medicinal plants in Indonesia. Therefore, this study will prepare a database which provides information of the three dimensional structures of chemical compounds of medicinal plants. The database will be prepared by using MySQL format and is designed to be placed in http://herbaldb.farmasi.ui.ac.id website so that eventually this database can be accessed quickly and easily by users via the Internet.
q-bio.BM:We investigate the possibility that prebiotic homochirality can be achieved exclusively through chiral-selective reaction rate parameters without any other explicit mechanism for chiral bias. Specifically, we examine an open network of polymerization reactions, where the reaction rates can have chiral-selective values. The reactions are neither autocatalytic nor do they contain explicit enantiomeric cross-inhibition terms. We are thus investigating how rare a set of chiral-selective reaction rates needs to be in order to generate a reasonable amount of chiral bias. We quantify our results adopting a statistical approach: varying both the mean value and the rms dispersion of the relevant reaction rates, we show that moderate to high levels of chiral excess can be achieved with fairly small chiral bias, below 10%. Considering the various unknowns related to prebiotic chemical networks in early Earth and the dependence of reaction rates to environmental properties such as temperature and pressure variations, we argue that homochirality could have been achieved from moderate amounts of chiral selectivity in the reaction rates.
q-bio.BM:Channels are Catalysts for Diffusion and in that sense are Enzymes. This idea is useful for the design and interpretation of experiments.
q-bio.BM:Ahmad et al. recently presented an NMR-based model for a bacterial DnaJ J domain:DnaK(Hsp70):ADP complex(1) that differs significantly from the crystal structure of a disulfide linked mammalian auxilin J domain:Hsc70 complex that we previously published(2). They claimed that their model could better account for existing mutational data, was in better agreement with previous NMR studies, and that the presence of a cross-link in our structure made it irrelevant to understanding J:Hsp70 interactions. Here we detail extensive NMR and mutational data relevant to understanding J:Hsp70 function and show that, in fact, our structure is much better able to account for the mutational data and is in much better agreement with a previous NMR study of a mammalian polyoma virus T-ag J domain:Hsc70 complex than is the Ahmad et al. complex, and that our structure is predictive and provides insight into J:Hsp70 interactions and mechanism of ATPase activation.
q-bio.BM:Protein function frequently involves conformational changes with large amplitude on timescales which are difficult and computationally expensive to access using molecular dynamics. In this paper, we report on the combination of three computationally inexpensive simulation methods-normal mode analysis using the elastic network model, rigidity analysis using the pebble game algorithm, and geometric simulation of protein motion-to explore conformational change along normal mode eigenvectors. Using a combination of ELNEMO and FIRST/FRODA software, large-amplitude motions in proteins with hundreds or thousands of residues can be rapidly explored within minutes using desktop computing resources. We apply the method to a representative set of six proteins covering a range of sizes and structural characteristics and show that the method identifies specific types of motion in each case and determines their amplitude limits.
q-bio.BM:The enzyme FoF1-ATP synthase provides the 'chemical energy currency' adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for living cells. Catalysis is driven by mechanochemical coupling of subunit rotation within the enzyme with conformational changes in the three ATP binding sites. Proton translocation through the membrane-bound Fo part of ATP synthase powers a 10-step rotary motion of the ring of c subunits. This rotation is transmitted to the gamma and epsilon subunits of the F1 part. Because gamma and epsilon subunits rotate in 120 deg steps, we aim to unravel this symmetry mismatch by real time monitoring subunit rotation using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). One fluorophore is attached specifically to the F1 motor, another one to the Fo motor of the liposome-reconstituted enzyme. Photophysical artifacts due to spectral fluctuations of the single fluorophores are minimized by a previously developed duty cycle-optimized alternating laser excitation scheme (DCO-ALEX). We report the detection of reversible elastic deformations between the rotor parts of Fo and F1 and estimate the maximum angular displacement during the load-free rotation using Monte Carlo simulations
q-bio.BM:A strain of Halomonas bacteria, GFAJ-1, has been reported to be able to use arsenate as a nutrient when phosphate is limiting, and to specifically incorporate arsenic into its DNA in place of phosphorus. However, we have found that arsenate does not contribute to growth of GFAJ-1 when phosphate is limiting and that DNA purified from cells grown with limiting phosphate and abundant arsenate does not exhibit the spontaneous hydrolysis expected of arsenate ester bonds. Furthermore, mass spectrometry showed that this DNA contains only trace amounts of free arsenate and no detectable covalently bound arsenate.
q-bio.BM:The fundamental law for protein folding is the Thermodynamic Principle: the amino acid sequence of a protein determines its native structure and the native structure has the minimum Gibbs free energy. If all chemical problems can be answered by quantum mechanics, there should be a quantum mechanics derivation of Gibbs free energy formula G(X) for every possible conformation X of the protein. We apply quantum statistics to derive such a formula. For simplicity, only monomeric self folding globular proteins are covered. We point out some immediate applications of the formula. We show that the formula explains the observed phenomena very well. It gives a unified explanation to both folding and denaturation; it explains why hydrophobic effect is the driving force of protein folding and clarifies the role played by hydrogen bonding; it explains the successes and deficients of various surface area models. The formula also gives a clear kinetic force of the folding: Fi(X) = - \nablaxi G(X). This also gives a natural way to perform the ab initio prediction of protein structure, minimizing G(X) by Newton's fastest desciending method.
q-bio.BM:Learning how proteins fold will hardly have any impact in the way conventional -- active site centered -- drugs are designed. On the other hand, this knowledge is proving instrumental in defining a new paradigm for the identification of drugs against any target protein: folding inhibition. Targeting folding renders drugs less prone to elicit spontaneous genetic mutations which in many cases, notably in connection with viruses like the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), can block therapeutic action. From the progress which has taken place during the last years in the understanding of the becoming of a protein, and how to read from the corresponding sequences the associated three-dimensional, biologically active, native structure, the idea of non-conventional (folding) inhibitors and thus of leads to eventual drugs to fight disease, arguably, without creating resistance, emerges as a distinct possibility.
q-bio.BM:Ever since the disorder of proteins is the main cause for many diseases. As compared with other disorders, the major reason that causes disease is of structural inability of many proteins. The potentially imminent availability of recent datasets helps one to discover the protein disorders, however in majority of cases, the stability of proteins depend on the carbon content. Addressing this distinct feature, it is possible to hit upon the carbon distribution along the sequence and can easily recognize the stable nature of protein. There are certain reported mental disorders which fall in to this category. Regardless, such kind of disorder prone protein FMR1p (Fragile X mental retardation 1 protein) is identified as the main cause for the disease Fragile X syndrome. This paper deals with the identification of defects in the FMR1 protein sequence considering the carbon contents along the sequence. This attempt is to evaluate the stability of proteins, accordingly the protein disorders in order to improvise the certain Biological functions of proteins to prevent disease. The transition of the disorder to order protein involves careful considerations and can be achieved by detecting the unstable region that lacks hydrophobicity. This work focuses the low carbon content in the FMR1 protein so as to attain the stable status in future to reduce the morbidity rate caused by Fragile X syndrome for the society.
q-bio.BM:Influenza virus evolves to escape from immune system antibodies that bind to it. We used free energy calculations with Einstein crystals as reference states to calculate the difference of antibody binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) induced by amino acid substitution at each position in epitope B of the H3N2 influenza hemagglutinin, the key target for antibody. A substitution with positive $\Delta\Delta G$ value decreases the antibody binding constant. On average an uncharged to charged amino acid substitution generates the highest $\Delta\Delta G$ values. Also on average, substitutions between small amino acids generate $\Delta\Delta G$ values near to zero. The 21 sites in epitope B have varying expected free energy differences for a random substitution. Historical amino acid substitutions in epitope B for the A/Aichi/2/1968 strain of influenza A show that most fixed and temporarily circulating substitutions generate positive $\Delta\Delta G$ values. We propose that the observed pattern of H3N2 virus evolution is affected by the free energy landscape, the mapping from the free energy landscape to virus fitness landscape, and random genetic drift of the virus. Monte Carlo simulations of virus evolution are presented to support this view.
q-bio.BM:Force field and first principles molecular dynamics simulations on complexes of pig liver esterase (pig liver isoenzymes and a mutant) and selected substrates (1-phenyl-1-ethyl acetate, 1- phenyl-2-butylacetate, proline-{\beta}-naphthylamide and methyl butyrate) are presented. By restrained force field simulations the access of the substrate to the hidden active site was probed. For a few substrates spontaneous access to the active site via a well defined entrance channel was found. The structure of the tetrahedral intermediate was simulated for several substrates and our previous assignment of GLU 452 instead of GLU 336 was confirmed. It was shown that the active site readily adapts to the embedded substrate involving a varying number of hydrophobic residues in the neighborhood. This puts into question key-lock models for enantioselectivity. Ab initio molecular dynamics showed that the structures we found for the tetrahedral intermediate in force field simulations are consistent with the presumed mechanism of ester cleavage. Product release from the active site as final step of the enzymatic reaction revealed to be very slow and took already more than 20ns for the smallest product, methanol.
q-bio.BM:Protein function often involves changes between different conformations. Central questions are how these conformational changes are coupled to the binding or catalytic processes during which they occur, and how they affect the catalytic rates of enzymes. An important model system is the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from E. coli, which exhibits characteristic conformational changes of the active-site loop during the catalytic step and during unbinding of the product. In this article, we present a general kinetic framework that can be used (1) to identify the ordering of events in the coupling of conformational changes, binding and catalysis and (2) to determine the rates of the substeps of coupled processes from a combined analysis of NMR R2 relaxation dispersion experiments and traditional enzyme kinetics measurements. We apply this framework to E. coli DHFR and find that the conformational change during product unbinding follows a conformational-selection mechanism, i.e. the conformational change occurs predominantly prior to unbinding. The conformational change during the catalytic step, in contrast, is an induced change, i.e. the change occurs after the chemical reaction. We propose that the reason for these conformational changes, which are absent in human and other vertebrate DHFRs, is robustness of the catalytic rate against large pH variations and changes to substrate/product concentrations in E. coli.
q-bio.BM:Ion channels are proteins with holes down their middle that control the flow of ions and electric current across otherwise impermeable biological membranes. The flow of sodium, potassium, calcium (divalent), and chloride ions have been central issues in biology for more than a century. The flow of current is responsible for the signals of the nervous system that propagate over long distances (meters). The concentration of divalent calcium ions is a 'universal' signal that controls many different systems inside cells. The concentration of divalent calcium and other messenger ions has a role in life rather like the role of the voltage in different wires of a computer. Ion channels also help much larger solutes (e.g., organic acid and bases; perhaps polypeptides) to cross membranes but much less is known about these systems. Ion channels can select and control the movement of different types of ions because the holes in channel proteins are a few times larger than the (crystal radii of the) ions themselves. Biology uses ion channels as selective valves to control flow and thus concentration of crucial chemical signals. For example, the concentration of divalent calcium ions determines whether muscles contract or not. Ion channels have a role in biology similar to the role of transistors in computers and technology. Ion Channels Control Concentrations Important To Life The Way Computers Control Voltages Important To Computers.
q-bio.BM:Chemistry is about chemical reactions. Chemistry is about electrons changing their configurations as atoms and molecules react. Chemistry studies reactions as if they occurred in ideal infinitely dilute solutions. But most reactions occur in nonideal solutions. Then everything (charged) interacts with everything else (charged) through the electric field, which is short and long range extending to boundaries of the system. Mathematics has recently been developed to deal with interacting systems of this sort. The variational theory of complex fluids has spawned the theory of liquid crystals. In my view, ionic solutions should be viewed as complex fluids. In both biology and electrochemistry ionic solutions are mixtures highly concentrated (~10M) where they are most important, near electrodes, nucleic acids, enzymes, and ion channels. Calcium is always involved in biological solutions because its concentration in a particular location is the signal that controls many biological functions. Such interacting systems are not simple fluids, and it is no wonder that analysis of interactions, such as the Hofmeister series, rooted in that tradition, has not succeeded as one would hope. We present a variational treatment of hard spheres in a frictional dielectric. The theory automatically extends to spatially nonuniform boundary conditions and the nonequilibrium systems and flows they produce. The theory is unavoidably self-consistent since differential equations are derived (not assumed) from models of (Helmholtz free) energy and dissipation of the electrolyte. The origin of the Hofmeister series is (in my view) an inverse problem that becomes well posed when enough data from disjoint experimental traditions are interpreted with a self-consistent theory.
q-bio.BM:A quantum mechanical model on histone modification is proposed. Along with the methyl / acetate or other groups bound to the modified residues the torsion angles of the nearby histone chain are supposed to participate in the quantum transition cooperatively. The transition rate W is calculated based on the non-radiative quantum transition theory in adiabatic approximation. By using W's the reaction equations can be written for histone modification and the histone modification level can be calculable from the equations, which is decided by not only the atomic group bound to the modified residue, but also the nearby histone chain. The theory can explain the mechanism for the correlation between a pair of chromatin markers observed in histone modification. The temperature dependence and the coherence-length dependence of histone modification are deduced. Several points for checking the proposed theory and the quantum nature of histone modification are suggested as follows: 1, The relationship between lnW and 1/T is same as usual protein folding. The non-Arhenius temperature dependence of the histone modification level is predicted. 2, The variation of histone modification level through point mutation of some residues on the chain is predicted since the mutation may change the coherence-length of the system. 3, Multi-site modification obeys the quantum superposition law and the comparison between multi-site transition and single modification transition gives an additional clue to the testing of the quantum nature of histone modification.
q-bio.BM:Inverted repeat (IR) sequences in DNA can form non-canonical cruciform structures to relieve torsional stress. We use Monte Carlo simulations of a recently developed coarse-grained model of DNA to demonstrate that the nucleation of a cruciform can proceed through a cooperative mechanism. Firstly, a twist-induced denaturation bubble must diffuse so that its midpoint is near the centre of symmetry of the IR sequence. Secondly, bubble fluctuations must be large enough to allow one of the arms to form a small number of hairpin bonds. Once the first arm is partially formed, the second arm can rapidly grow to a similar size. Because bubbles can twist back on themselves, they need considerably fewer bases to resolve torsional stress than the final cruciform state does. The initially stabilised cruciform therefore continues to grow, which typically proceeds synchronously, reminiscent of the S-type mechanism of cruciform formation. By using umbrella sampling techniques we calculate, for different temperatures and superhelical densities, the free energy as a function of the number of bonds in each cruciform along the correlated but non-synchronous nucleation pathways we observed in direct simulations.
q-bio.BM:Emerging high-throughput technologies have led to a deluge of putative non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences identified in a wide variety of organisms. Systematic characterization of these transcripts will be a tremendous challenge. Homology detection is critical to making maximal use of functional information gathered about ncRNAs: identifying homologous sequence allows us to transfer information gathered in one organism to another quickly and with a high degree of confidence. ncRNA presents a challenge for homology detection, as the primary sequence is often poorly conserved and de novo secondary structure prediction and search remains difficult. This protocol introduces methods developed by the Rfam database for identifying "families" of homologous ncRNAs starting from single "seed" sequences using manually curated sequence alignments to build powerful statistical models of sequence and structure conservation known as covariance models (CMs), implemented in the Infernal software package. We provide a step-by-step iterative protocol for identifying ncRNA homologs, then constructing an alignment and corresponding CM. We also work through an example for the bacterial small RNA MicA, discovering a previously unreported family of divergent MicA homologs in genus Xenorhabdus in the process.
q-bio.BM:DNA is subject to large deformations in a wide range of biological processes. Two key examples illustrate how such deformations influence the readout of the genetic information: the sequestering of eukaryotic genes by nucleosomes, and DNA looping in transcriptional regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These kinds of regulatory problems are now becoming amenable to systematic quantitative dissection with a powerful dialogue between theory and experiment. Here we use a single-molecule experiment in conjunction with a statistical mechanical model to test quantitative predictions for the behavior of DNA looping at short length scales, and to determine how DNA sequence affects looping at these lengths. We calculate and measure how such looping depends upon four key biological parameters: the strength of the transcription factor binding sites, the concentration of the transcription factor, and the length and sequence of the DNA loop. Our studies lead to the surprising insight that sequences that are thought to be especially favorable for nucleosome formation because of high flexibility lead to no systematically detectable effect of sequence on looping, and begin to provide a picture of the distinctions between the short length scale mechanics of nucleosome formation and looping.
q-bio.BM:For decades, dimethyl sulfate (DMS) mapping has informed manual modeling of RNA structure in vitro and in vivo. Here, we incorporate DMS data into automated secondary structure inference using a pseudo-energy framework developed for 2'-OH acylation (SHAPE) mapping. On six non-coding RNAs with crystallographic models, DMS- guided modeling achieves overall false negative and false discovery rates of 9.5% and 11.6%, comparable or better than SHAPE-guided modeling; and non-parametric bootstrapping provides straightforward confidence estimates. Integrating DMS/SHAPE data and including CMCT reactivities give small additional improvements. These results establish DMS mapping - an already routine technique - as a quantitative tool for unbiased RNA structure modeling.
q-bio.BM:Hydrogen bonds are a common feature in protein folding and aggregation. Due to their chemical peculiarities in terms of strength and directionality, a particular attention must be paid to the definition of the hydrogen bond potential itself. This global target has been tackled through a computational approach based on a minimalist description of the protein and the proper design of algorithms, mainly using Monte Carlo and Kinetic Monte Carlo methods. We have designed a hydrogen bond potential, see J. Chem. Phys. 132, 235102 (2010). We have been performed a complete study of sequenceless peptide systems under different conditions, such as temperature and concentration. To carry out full protein studies, we need additional potentials to describe tertiary interactions. We have discussed two different points of view. The first one is the combination of the hydrogen bond potential with a structure-based one. We have evaluated the implications of a proper definition of hydrogen bonds in the thermodynamic and dynamic aspects of protein folding. See Biophys. J. 101, 1474-1482 (2011). We have undertaken a second strategy, combining a generic hydrophobic model with the hydrogen bond one. The two main factors of folding and aggregation are merged, then, to create a simple but complete potential. Thanks to it, we have re-studied peptide aggregation including sequence. Besides, we have simulated complete proteins with different folded shapes. We have analyzed the competition between folding and aggregation, and how sequence and hydrogen bonds can influence the interplay between them. See J. Chem. Phys. 136, 215103 (2012).
q-bio.BM:Consistently predicting biopolymer structure at atomic resolution from sequence alone remains a difficult problem, even for small sub-segments of large proteins. Such loop prediction challenges, which arise frequently in comparative modeling and protein design, can become intractable as loop lengths exceed 10 residues and if surrounding side-chain conformations are erased. This article introduces a modeling strategy based on a 'stepwise ansatz', recently developed for RNA modeling, which posits that any realistic all-atom molecular conformation can be built up by residue-by-residue stepwise enumeration. When harnessed to a dynamic-programming-like recursion in the Rosetta framework, the resulting stepwise assembly (SWA) protocol enables enumerative sampling of a 12 residue loop at a significant but achievable cost of thousands of CPU-hours. In a previously established benchmark, SWA recovers crystallographic conformations with sub-Angstrom accuracy for 19 of 20 loops, compared to 14 of 20 by KIC modeling with a comparable expenditure of computational power. Furthermore, SWA gives high accuracy results on an additional set of 15 loops highlighted in the biological literature for their irregularity or unusual length. Successes include cis-Pro touch turns, loops that pass through tunnels of other side-chains, and loops of lengths up to 24 residues. Remaining problem cases are traced to inaccuracies in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. In five additional blind tests, SWA achieves sub-Angstrom accuracy models, including the first such success in a protein/RNA binding interface, the YbxF/kink-turn interaction in the fourth RNA-puzzle competition. These results establish all-atom enumeration as a systematic approach to protein structure that can leverage high performance computing and physically realistic energy functions to more consistently achieve atomic resolution.
q-bio.BM:Self-associates of nucleic acid components (stacking trimers and tetramers of the base pairs of nucleic acids) and short fragments of nucleic acids are nanoparticles (linear sizes of these particles are more than 10 A. Modern quantum-mechanical methods and softwares allow one to perform ab initio calculations of the systems consisting of 150-200 atoms with enough large basis sets (for example, 6-31G*). The aim of this work is to reveal the peculiarities of molecular and electronic structures, as well as the energy features of nanoparticles of nucleic acid components.
q-bio.BM:Influenza virus contains two highly variable envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The structure and properties of HA, which is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected, change significantly when the virus is transmitted from avian or swine species to humans. Here we focus on much smaller human individual evolutionary amino acid mutational changes in NA, which cleaves sialic acid groups and is required for influenza virus replication. We show that very small amino acid changes can be monitored very accurately across many Uniprot and NCBI strains using hydropathicity scales to quantify the roughness of water film packages. Quantitative sequential analysis is most effective with the differential hydropathicity scale based on protein self-organized criticality (SOC). NA exhibits punctuated evolution at the molecular scale, millions of times smaller than the more familiar species scale, and thousands of times smaller than the genomic scale. Our analysis shows that large-scale vaccination programs have been responsible for a very large convergent reduction in influenza severity in the last century, a reduction which is hidden from short-term studies of vaccine effectiveness. Hydropathic analysis is capable of interpreting and even predicting trends of functional changes in mutation prolific viruses.
q-bio.BM:Influenza virus contains two highly variable envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The structure and properties of HA, which is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected, change significantly when the virus is transmitted from avian or swine species to humans. Previously we identified much smaller human individual evolutionary amino acid mutational changes in NA, which cleaves sialic acid groups and is required for influenza virus replication. We showed that these smaller changes can be monitored very accurately across many Uniprot and NCBI strains using hydropathicity scales to quantify the roughness of water film packages, which increases gradually due to migration, but decreases abruptly under large-scale vaccination pressures. Here we show that, while HA evolution is much more complex, it still shows abrupt punctuation changes linked to those of NA. HA exhibits proteinquakes, which resemble earthquakes and are related to hydropathic shifting of sialic acid binding regions. HA proteinquakes based on sialic acid interactions are required for optimal balance between the receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities of HA and NA for efficient virus replication. Our comprehensive results present an historical (1945-2011) panorama of HA evolution over thousands of strains, and are consistent with many studies of HA and NA interactions based on a few mutations of a few strains. While the common influenza virus discussed here has been rendered almost harmless by decades of vaccination programs, the sequential decoding lessons learned here are applicable to other viruses that are emerging as powerful weapons for controlling and even curing common organ cancers. Those engineered oncolytic drugs will be discussed in future papers.
q-bio.BM:While the concepts involved in Self-Organized Criticality have stimulated thousands of theoretical models, only recently have these models addressed problems of biological and clinical importance. Here we outline how SOC can be used to engineer hybrid viral proteins whose properties, extrapolated from those of known strains, may be sufficiently effective to cure cancer.
q-bio.BM:Although mechanical properties of DNA are well characterized at the kilo base-pair range, a number of recent experiments have suggested that DNA is more flexible at shorter length scales, which correspond to the regime that is crucial for cellular processes such as DNA packaging and gene regulation. Here, we perform a systematic study of the effective elastic properties of DNA at different length scales by probing the conformation and fluctuations of DNA from single base-pair level up to four helical turns, using trajectories from atomistic simulation. We find evidence that supports cooperative softening of the stretch modulus and identify the essential modes that give rise to this effect. The bend correlation exhibits modulations that reflect the helical periodicity, while it yields a reasonable value for the effective persistence length, and the twist modulus undergoes a smooth crossover---from a relatively smaller value at the single base-pair level to the bulk value---over half a DNA-turn.
q-bio.BM:Mutations and oxidative modification in the protein Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been implicated in the death of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a presently incurable, invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Here we employ steered, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent to investigate the significance of either mutations or post-translational modifications (PTMs) to SOD1 on metal affinity, dimer stability, and mechanical malleability. The work required to induce moderate structural deformations as a function of sequence index constitutes a "mechanical fingerprint" measuring structural rigidity in the native basin, from which we are able to unambiguously distinguish wild-type (WT) SOD1 from PTM variants, and measure the severity of a given PTM on structural integrity. The cumulative distribution of work values provided a way to cleanly discriminate between SOD1 variants. Disulfide reduction destabilizes dimer stability more than the removal of either metal, but not moreso than the removal of both metals. Intriguingly, we found that disulfide reduction mechanically stabilizes apo SOD1 monomer, underscoring the differences between native basin mechanical properties and equilibrium thermodynamic stabilities, and elucidating the presence of internal stress in the apo state. All PTMs and ALS-associated mutants studied showed an increased tendency to lose either Cu or Zn, and to monomerize- processes known to be critical in the progression of ALS. The valence of Cu strongly modulates its binding free energy. As well, several mutants were more susceptible to loss of metals and monomerization than the disulfide-reduced or apo forms of SOD1. Distance constraints are required to calculate free energies for metal binding and dimer separation, which are validated using thermodynamic cycles.
q-bio.BM:Availability of high-resolution crystal structures of ribosomal subunits of different species opens a route to investigate about molecular interactions between its constituents and stabilization strategy. Structural analysis of the small ribosomal subunit shows that primary binder proteins are mainly employed in stabilizing the folded ribosomal RNA by their high negative free energy of association, where tertiary binders mainly help to stabilize protein-protein interfaces. Secondary binders perform both the functions. Conformational changes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal proteins due to complexation with 16S ribosomal RNA are linearly correlated with their RNA-interface area and free energy of association. The proteins having long extensions buried within ribosomal RNA have more flexible structures than those found on the subunit surface. Thermus thermophilus ribosomal proteins undergo high conformational changes compared to those of Escherichia coli, assuring structural stability at high temperature environment. The general stabilization strategy of ribosomal protein-RNA interfaces is shown, where high interface polarity ensures high surface density of Hydrogen bonds even with low base/backbone ratio. Polarity is regulated in evolutionary strategy of ribosomal proteins. Thus, the habitat environmental conditions of the two species sweet up their ribosomal protein-RNA interfaces to alter its physical parameters in order of stabilization.
q-bio.BM:Motivation: Protein surface roughness is fractal in nature. Mass, hydrophobicity, polarizability distributions of protein interior are fractal too, as are the distributions of dipole moments, aromatic residues, and many other structural determinants. The open-access server ProtFract, presents a reliable way to obtain numerous fractal-dimension and correlation-dimension based results to quantify the symmetry of self-similarity in distributions of various properties of protein interior and exterior.   Results: Fractal dimension based comparative analyses of various biophysical properties of Ras superfamily proteins were conducted. Though the extent of sequence and functional overlapping across Ras superfamily structures is extremely high, results obtained from ProtFract investigation are found to be sensitive to detect differences in the distribution of each of the properties. For example, it was found that the RAN proteins are structurally most stable amongst all Ras superfamily proteins, the ARFs possess maximum extent of unused hydrophobicity in their structures, RAB protein interiors have electrostatically least conducive environment, GEM/REM/RAD proteins possess exceptionally high symmetry in the structural organization of their active chiral centres, neither hydrophobicity nor columbic interactions play significant part in stabilizing the RAS proteins but aromatic interactions do, though cation-pi interactions are found to be more dominant in RAN than in RAS proteins. Ras superfamily proteins can best be classified with respect to their class-specific pi-pi and cation-pi interaction symmetries.

q-bio.BM:Upon studying the B-Factors of all the atoms of all non-redundant proteins belonging to 76 most commonly found structural domains of all four major structural classes, it was found that the residue mobility has decreased during the course of evolution. Though increased residue-flexibility was preferred in the early stages of protein structure evolution, less flexibility is preferred in the medieval and recent stages. GLU is found to be the most flexible residue while VAL recorded to have the least flexibility. General trends in decrement of B-Factors conformed to the general trend in the order of emergence of protein structural domains. Decrement of B-Factor is observed to be most decisive (monotonic and uniform) for VAL, while evolution of CYS and LYS flexibility is found to be most skewed. Barring CYS, flexibility of all the residues is found to have increased during evolution of alpha by beta folds, however flexibility of all the residues (barring CYS) is found to have decreased during evolution of all beta folds. Only in alpha by beta folds the tendency of preferring higher residue mobility could be observed, neither alpha plus beta, nor all alpha nor all beta folds were found to support higher residue-mobility. In all the structural classes, the effect of evolutionary constraint on polar residues is found to follow an exactly identical trend as that on hydrophobic residues, only the extent of these effects are found to be different. Though protein size is found to be decreasing during evolution, residue mobility of proteins belonging to ancient and old structural domains showed strong positive dependency upon protein size, however for medieval and recent domains such dependency vanished. It is found that to optimize residue fluctuations, alpha by beta class of proteins are subjected to more stringent evolutionary constraints.
q-bio.BM:Recent experimental data indicate that the elastic wormlike rod model of DNA that works well on long length scales may break down on shorter scales relevant to biology. According to Noy and Golestanian (Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 228101, 2012) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predict DNA rigidity close to experimental data and confirm one scenario of such breakdown, namely, that for lengths of a few helical turns, DNA dynamics exhibit long-range bending and stretching correlations. Earlier studies using similar forcefields concluded that (i) MD systematically overestimate the DNA rigidity, and (ii) no deviations from the WLR model are detectable. Here it is argued that the data analysis in the above mentioned paper was incorrect and that the earlier conclusions are valid.
q-bio.BM:Superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) is a ubiquitous, Cu and Zn binding, free radical defense enzyme whose misfolding and aggregation play a potential key role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease. Over 150 mutations in SOD1 have been identified with a familial form of the disease, but it is presently not clear what unifying features, if any, these mutants share to make them pathogenic. Here, we develop several new computational assays for probing the thermo-mechanical properties of both ALS-associated and rationally-designed SOD1 variants. Allosteric interaction free energies between residues and metals are calculated, and a series of atomic force microscopy experiments are simulated with variable tether positions, to quantify mechanical rigidity "fingerprints" for SOD1 variants. Mechanical fingerprinting studies of a series of C-terminally truncated mutants, along with an analysis of equilibrium dynamic fluctuations while varying native constraints, potential energy change upon mutation, frustratometer analysis, and analysis of the coupling between local frustration and metal binding interactions for a glycine scan of 90 residues together reveal that the apo protein is internally frustrated, that these internal stresses are partially relieved by mutation but at the expense of metal-binding affinity, and that the frustration of a residue is directly related to its role in binding metals. This evidence points to apo SOD1 as a strained intermediate with "self-allostery" for high metal-binding affinity. Thus, the prerequisites for the function of SOD1 as an antioxidant compete with apo state thermo-mechanical stability, increasing the susceptibility of the protein to misfold in the apo state.

q-bio.BM:The conformational change of biological macromolecule is investigated from the point of quantum transition. A quantum theory on protein folding is proposed. Compared with other dynamical variables such as mobile electrons, chemical bonds and stretching-bending vibrations the molecular torsion has the lowest energy and can be looked as the slow variable of the system. Simultaneously, from the multi-minima property of torsion potential the local conformational states are well defined. Following the idea that the slow variables slave the fast ones and using the nonadiabaticity operator method we deduce the Hamiltonian describing conformational change. It is proved that the influence of fast variables on the macromolecule can fully be taken into account through a phase transformation of slow variable wave function. Starting from the conformation- transition Hamiltonian the nonradiative matrix element is calculated in two important cases: A, only electrons are fast variables and the electronic state does not change in the transition process; B, fast variables are not limited to electrons but the perturbation approximation can be used. Then, the general formulas for protein folding rate are deduced. The analytical form of the formula is utilized to study the temperature dependence of protein folding rate and the curious non-Arrhenius temperature relation is interpreted. The decoherence time of quantum torsion state is estimated and the quantum coherence degree of torsional angles in the protein folding is studied by using temperature dependence data. The proposed folding rate formula gives a unifying approach for the study of a large class problems of biological conformational change.
q-bio.BM:It is established that prion protein is the sole causative agent in a number of diseases in humans and animals. However, the nature of conformational changes that the normal cellular form PrPC undergoes in the conversion process to a self-replicating state is still not fully understood. The ordered C-terminus of PrPC proteins has three helices (H1, H2, and H3). Here, we use the Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) to infer co-variations at various locations using a family of evolutionarily related sequences, and the response of mouse and human PrPCs to mechanical force to decipher the initiation sites for transition from PrPC to an aggregation prone PrP* state. The sequence-based SCA predicts that the clustered residues in non-mammals are localized in the stable core (near H1) of PrPC whereas in mammalian PrPC they are localized in the frustrated helices H2 and H3 where most of the pathogenic mutations are found. Force-extension curves and free energy profiles as a function of extension of mouse and human PrPC in the absence of disulfide (SS) bond between residues Cys179 and Cys214, generated by applying mechanical force to the ends of the molecule, show a sequence of unfolding events starting first with rupture of H2 and H3. This is followed by disruption of structure in two strands. Helix H1, stabilized by three salt-bridges, resists substantial force before unfolding. Force extension profiles and the dynamics of rupture of tertiary contacts also show that even in the presence of SS bond the instabilities in most of H3 and parts of H2 still determine the propensity to form the PrP* state. In mouse PrPC with SS bond there are about ten residues that retain their order even at high forces.
q-bio.BM:Antimicrobial peptides are a class of small, usually positively charged amphiphilic peptides that are used by the innate immune system to combat bacterial infection in multicellular eukaryotes. Antimicrobial peptides are known for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and thus can be used as a basis for a development of new antibiotics against multidrug-resistant bacteria. The most challengeous task on the way to a therapeutic use of antimicrobial peptides is a rational design of new peptides with enhanced activity and reduced toxicity. Here we report a molecular dynamics and circular dichroism study of a novel synthetic antimicrobial peptide D51. This peptide was earlier designed by Loose et al. using a linguistic model of natural antimicrobial peptides. Molecular dynamics simulation of the peptide folding in explicit solvent shows fast formation of two antiparallel beta strands connected by a beta-turn that is confirmed by circular dichroism measurements. Obtained from simulation amphipatic conformation of the peptide is analysed and possible mechanism of its interaction with bacterial membranes together with ways to enhance its antibacterial activity are suggested.
q-bio.BM:Side chain flexibility is an important factor in ligand binding. In order to determine the extent to which side chain flexibility is involved in ligand binding, a knowledge-based approach was taken. A database composed of examples of protein structures in the presence or absence of a given ligand is used to analyze which side chains undergo side chain conformational changes. Such an analysis has determined that up to 40% of binding site do not present side chain conformational changes. A total of three residues undergoing side chain conformational changes encompass approximately 85% of the binding sites studied. When analyzing the propensities of different amino acids to undergo side chain conformational changes we find that there are considerable differences between different amino acids. A support vector machine learning approach was used to create a classifier system utilizing information about the solvent accessible area as well as flexibility scale value of each specific side chain to be predicted together with its neighboring side chains. An accuracy level of 70% is reached using this approach. The fact that a small number of residues undergo side chain conformational changes in the majority of binding sites makes it feasible to introduce side chain flexibility in docking simulations. An algorithm has been developed for introducing side chain flexibility utilizing a hybrid genetic-algorithm/exhaustive-search procedure and a surface complementarity based scoring function. This approach is implemented in the software tool FlexAID. FlexAID utilizes a rotamer library to create alternative conformations for a list of residues that are exhaustively searched during the docking simulation. The performance of FlexAID in rigid local as well as global simulations falls in the 70-80% range for both local and global simulations.
q-bio.BM:Chemical mapping is a widespread technique for structural analysis of nucleic acids in which a molecule's reactivity to different probes is quantified at single-nucleotide resolution and used to constrain structural modeling. This experimental framework has been extensively revisited in the past decade with new strategies for high-throughput read-outs, chemical modification, and rapid data analysis. Recently, we have coupled the technique to high-throughput mutagenesis. Point mutations of a base-paired nucleotide can lead to exposure of not only that nucleotide but also its interaction partner. Carrying out the mutation and mapping for the entire system gives an experimental approximation of the molecules contact map. Here, we give our in-house protocol for this mutate-and-map strategy, based on 96-well capillary electrophoresis, and we provide practical tips on interpreting the data to infer nucleic acid structure.
q-bio.BM:A central question is how the conformational changes of proteins affect their function and the inhibition of this function by drug molecules. Many enzymes change from an open to a closed conformation upon binding of substrate or inhibitor molecules. These conformational changes have been suggested to follow an induced-fit mechanism in which the molecules first bind in the open conformation in those cases where binding in the closed conformation appears to be sterically obstructed such as for the HIV-1 protease. In this article, we present a general model for the catalysis and inhibition of enzymes with induced-fit binding mechanism. We derive general expressions that specify how the overall catalytic rate of the enzymes depends on the rates for binding, for the conformational changes, and for the chemical reaction. Based on these expressions, we analyze the effect of mutations that mainly shift the conformational equilibrium on catalysis and inhibition. If the overall catalytic rate is limited by product unbinding, we find that mutations that destabilize the closed conformation relative to the open conformation increase the catalytic rate in the presence of inhibitors by a factor exp(ddG/RT) where ddG is the mutation-induced shift of the free-energy difference between the conformations. This increase in the catalytic rate due to changes in the conformational equilibrium is independent of the inhibitor molecule and, thus, may help to understand how non-active-site mutations can contribute to the multi-drug-resistance that has been observed for the HIV-1 protease. A comparison to experimental data for the non-active-site mutation L90M of the HIV-1 protease indicates that the mutation slightly destabilizes the closed conformation of the enzyme.
q-bio.BM:Studying all non-redundant proteins in 76 most-commonly found structural domains, the present work attempts to decipher latent patterns that characterize acceptable and unacceptable symmetries in residue-residue interactions in functional proteins. We report that cutting across the structural classes, a select set of pairwise interactions are universally favored by geometrical and evolutionary constraints, termed 'acceptable' structural and evolutionary tunnels, respectively. An equally small subset of residue-residue interactions, the 'unacceptable' structural and evolutionary tunnels, is found to be universally disliked by structural and evolutionary constraints. Non-trivial overlapping is detected among acceptable structural and evolutionary tunnels, as also among unacceptable structural and evolutionary tunnels. A subset of tunnels is found to have equal relative importance, structurally and evolutionarily, in different structural classes. The MET-MET tunnel is detected to be universally most unacceptable by both structural and evolutionary constraints, whereas the ASP-LEU tunnel was found to be the closest approximation to be universally most acceptable. Residual populations in structural and evolutionary tunnels are found to be independent of stereochemical properties of individual residues. It is argued with examples that tunnels are emergent features that connect extent of symmetry in residue-residue interactions to the level of quaternary structural organization.
q-bio.BM:In many biological applications, we would like to be able to computationally predict mutational effects on affinity in protein-protein interactions. However, many commonly used methods to predict these effects perform poorly in important test cases. In particular, the effects of multiple mutations, non-alanine substitutions, and flexible loops are difficult to predict with available tools and protocols. We present here an existing method applied in a novel way to a new test case; we interrogate affinity differences resulting from mutations in a host-virus protein-protein interface. We use steered molecular dynamics (SMD) to computationally pull the machupo virus (MACV) spike glycoprotein (GP1) away from the human transferrin receptor (hTfR1). We then approximate affinity using the maximum applied force of separation and the area under the force-versus-distance curve. We find, even without the rigor and planning required for free energy calculations, that these quantities can provide novel biophysical insight into the GP1/hTfR1 interaction. First, with no prior knowledge of the system we can differentiate among wild type and mutant complexes. Moreover, we show that this simple SMD scheme correlates well with relative free energy differences computed via free energy perturbation. Second, although the static co-crystal structure shows two large hydrogen-bonding networks in the GP1/hTfR1 interface, our simulations indicate that one of them may not be important for tight binding. Third, one viral site known to be critical for infection may mark an important evolutionary suppressor site for infection-resistant hTfR1 mutants. Finally, our approach provides a framework to compare the effects of multiple mutations, individually and jointly, on protein-protein interactions.
q-bio.BM:We have studied the mobility of the folding catalyst, protein disulphide-isomerase (PDI), by molecular dynamics and by a rapid approach based on flexibility. We analysed our simulations using measures of backbone movement, relative positions and orientations of domains, and distances between functional sites. Despite their different assumptions, the two methods are surprisingly consistent. Both methods agree that motion of domains is dominated by hinge and rotation motion of the a and a' domains relative to the central b-b' domain core. We identify the a' domain as showing the greatest intra-domain mobility. The flexibility method, which requires 10^4-fold less computer power, predicts additional large-scale features of inter-domain motion that have been observed experimentally. We conclude that the methods offer complementary insight into the motion of this large protein and provide detailed structural models that characterise its functionally-significant conformational changes.
q-bio.BM:The famous series of Fibonacci numbers is defined by a recursive equation saying that each number is the sum of its two predecessors, with the initial condition that the first two numbers are equal to unity. Here, we show that the numbers of fatty acids (straight-chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids) with n carbon atoms is exactly given by the Fibonacci numbers. Thus, by investing one more carbon atom into extending a fatty acid, an organism can increase the variability of the fatty acids approximately by the factor of the Golden section, 1.618. As the Fibonacci series grows asymptotically exponentially, our results are in line with combinatorial complexity found generally in biology. We also outline potential extensions of the calculations to modified (e.g., hydroxylated) fatty acids. The presented enumeration method may be of interest for lipidomics, combinatorial chemistry, synthetic biology and the theory of evolution (including prebiotic evolution).
q-bio.BM:Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters form a family of molecular motor proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation across cell membranes. Each nucleotide binding domain of ABC-transporters contains a highly conserved H-loop Histidine residue, whose precise mechanistic role to motor functions has remained elusive. By using combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical calculations, we showed that the conserved H-loop residue H662 in E. coli HlyB, a bacterial ABC transporter, can act first as a general acid and then as a general base to facilitate proton transfers in ATP hydrolysis. Without the assistance of H662, direct proton transfer from the lytic water to ATP results in a greatly elevated barrier height. Our findings suggest that the essential function of the H-loop residue H662 is to provide a "chemical linchpin" that shuttles protons between reactants through a relay mechanism, thereby catalyzing ATP hydrolysis in HlyB.
q-bio.BM:Proofreading/editing in protein synthesis is essential for accurate translation of information from the genetic code. In this article we present a theoretical investigation of efficiency of a kinetic proofreading mechanism that employs hydrolysis of the wrong substrate as the discriminatory step in enzyme catalytic reactions. We consider aminoacylation of tRNA^{Ile} which is a crucial step in protein synthesis and for which experimental results are now available. We present an augmented kinetic scheme and then employ methods of stochastic simulation algorithm to obtain time dependent concentrations of different substances involved in the reaction and their rates of formation. We obtain the rates of product formation and ATP hydrolysis for both correct and wrong substrates (isoleucine and valine in our case), in single molecular enzyme as well as ensemble enzyme kinetics. The present theoretical scheme correctly reproduces (i) the amplitude of the discrimination factor in the overall rates between isoleucine and valine which is obtained as (1.8 \times 10^2).(4.33 \times 10^2) = 7.8 \times 10^4, (ii) the rates of ATP hydrolysis for both Ile and Val at different substrate concentrations in the aminoacylation of tRNA^{Ile}. The present study shows a non-michaelis type dependence of rate of reaction on tRNA^{Ile} concentration in case of valine. The editing in steady state is found to be independent of amino acid concentration. Interestingly, the computed ATP hydrolysis rate for valine at high substrate concentration is same as the rate of formation of Ile-tRNA^{Ile} whereas at intermediate substrate concentration the ATP hydrolysis rate is relatively low.
q-bio.BM:So far, more than 82,000 protein structures have been reported in the Protein Data Bank, but the driving force and structures that allow for protein functions have not been elucidated at the atomic level for even one protein. We have been able to clarify that the inter-subunit hydrophobic interaction driving the electrostatic opening of the pore in aquaporin 0 (AQP0). Aquaporins are membrane channels for water and small non-ionic solutes found in animals, plants, and microbes. The structures of aquaporins have high homology and consist of homotetramers, each monomer of which has one pore for a water channel. Each pore has two narrow portions: one is the narrowest constriction region consisting of aromatic residues and an arginine (ar/R), and another is two asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) homolog portions. Here we show that an inter-subunit hydrophobic interaction in AQP0 drives a stick portion consisting of four amino acids toward the pore and the tip of the stick portion, consisting of a nitrogen atom, opens the pore: that movement is the swing mechanism (this http URL). The energetics and conformational change of amino acids participating in the swing mechanism confirm this view. The swing mechanism in which inter-subunit hydrophobic interactions in the tetramer drive the on-off switching of the pore explains why aquaporins consist of tetramers. Here, we report that experimental and molecular dynamics findings using various mutants support this view of the swing mechanism. The finding that mutants of amino acids in AQP2 corresponding to the stick of the swing mechanism cause severe recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) demonstrates the critical role of the swing mechanism for the aquaporin function. We report first that the inter-subunit hydrophobic interaction in aquaporin 0 drives the electrostatic opening of the aquaporin pore at the atomic level.
q-bio.BM:The study reported here concerns a phenomenon, discovered and extensively investigated by Sorin Comorosan, wherein enzyme initial reaction rates are enhanced as a consequence of incorporation of solutions derived from previously irradiated crystalline material into the reaction medium. Effective irradiation times conform to a sharply oscillatory pattern. In most reports, the irradiated crystalline material has been the substrate for the enzyme reaction to be studied, but there have been exceptions. The experiments presented here serve to confirm and extend this latter aspect of the phenomenon. It is found that the initial reaction rates for the lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) conversion of pyruvate to lactate can be stimulated by irradiation of crystalline deposits of sodium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium chloride and diatomaceous earth. Similarly, stimulation of the LDH conversion of lactate to pyruvate is demonstrated for irradiated sodium chloride. There appears to be no required chemical feature of the irradiated material other than crystalline state.
q-bio.BM:ATP-hydrolysis is the basic energy source of many physiological processes, but there is a lack of knowledge regarding its biological role other than energy transfer and thermogenesis. Not all the energy released by ATP-hydrolysis could be used in powering target biological processes and functions. Partial energy dissipates into water. By validating the impact of this dissipated energy, we found that energy released by ATP hydrolysis could induce notable regulation of biomolecule's properties 100 nanometers away. Namely ATP hydrolyzation is recycled in remote biochemical property modulation.
q-bio.BM:The conformational vibrations of Z-DNA with counterions are studied in framework of phenomenological model developed. The structure of left-handed double helix with counterions neutralizing the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA is considered as the ion-phosphate lattice. The frequencies and Raman intensities for the modes of Z-DNA with Na+ and Mg2+ ions are calculated, and the low-frequency Raman spectra are built. At the spectra range about the frequency 150 cm-1 new mode of ion-phosphate vibrations is found, which characterizes the vibrations of Mg2+ counterions. The results of our calculations show that the intensities of Z-DNA modes are sensitive to the concentration of magnesium counterions. The obtained results describe well the experimental Raman spectra of Z-DNA.
q-bio.BM:Ions in water are important in biology, from molecules to organs. Classically, ions in water are treated as ideal noninteracting particles in a perfect gas. Excess free energy of ion was zero. Mathematics was not available to deal consistently with flows, or interactions with ions or boundaries. Non-classical approaches are needed because ions in biological conditions flow and interact. The concentration gradient of one ion can drive the flow of another, even in a bulk solution. A variational multiscale approach is needed to deal with interactions and flow. The recently developed energetic variational approach to dissipative systems allows mathematically consistent treatment of bio-ions Na, K, Ca and Cl as they interact and flow. Interactions produce large excess free energy that dominate the properties of the high concentration of ions in and near protein active sites, channels, and nucleic acids: the number density of ions is often more than 10 M. Ions in such crowded quarters interact strongly with each other as well as with the surrounding protein. Non-ideal behavior has classically been ascribed to allosteric interactions mediated by protein conformation changes. Ion-ion interactions present in crowded solutions--independent of conformation changes of proteins--are likely to change interpretations of allosteric phenomena. Computation of all atoms is a popular alternative to the multiscale approach. Such computations involve formidable challenges. Biological systems exist on very different scales from atomic motion. Biological systems exist in ionic mixtures (extracellular/intracellular solutions), and usually involve flow and trace concentrations of messenger ions (e.g., 10-7 M Ca2+). Energetic variational methods can deal with these characteristic properties of biological systems while we await the maturation and calibration of all atom simulations of ionic mixtures and divalents.
q-bio.BM:A mechanism of the replication of proto-RNAs in oligomer world is proposed. The replication is carried out by a minimum cycle which is sustained by a ligase and a helicase. We expect that such a cycle actually worked in the primordial soup and can be constructed in vitro. By computer simulation the products of the replication acquires diversity and complexity. Such diversity and complexity are the bases of the evolution.
q-bio.BM:To determine the 3D conformation of proteins is a necessity to understand their functions or interactions with other molecules. It is commonly admitted that, when proteins fold from their primary linear structures to their final 3D conformations, they tend to choose the ones that minimize their free energy. To find the 3D conformation of a protein knowing its amino acid sequence, bioinformaticians use various models of different resolutions and artificial intelligence tools, as the protein folding prediction problem is a NP complete one. More precisely, to determine the backbone structure of the protein using the low resolution models (2D HP square and 3D HP cubic), by finding the conformation that minimize free energy, is intractable exactly. Both the proof of NP-completeness and the 2D prediction consider that acceptable conformations have to satisfy a self-avoiding walk (SAW) requirement, as two different amino acids cannot occupy a same position in the lattice. It is shown in this document that the SAW requirement considered when proving NP-completeness is different from the SAW requirement used in various prediction programs, and that they are different from the real biological requirement. Indeed, the proof of NP completeness and the predictions in silico consider conformations that are not possible in practice. Consequences of this fact are investigated in this research work.
q-bio.BM:Self-avoiding walks (SAW) are the source of very difficult problems in probabilities and enumerative combinatorics. They are also of great interest as they are, for instance, the basis of protein structure prediction in bioinformatics. Authors of this article have previously shown that, depending on the prediction algorithm, the sets of obtained conformations differ: all the self-avoiding walks can be reached using stretching-based algorithms whereas only the folded SAWs can be attained with methods that iteratively fold the straight line. A first study of (un)folded self-avoiding walks is presented in this article. The contribution is majorly a survey of what is currently known about these sets. In particular we provide clear definitions of various subsets of self-avoiding walks related to pivot moves (folded or unfoldable SAWs, etc.) and the first results we have obtained, theoretically or computationally, on these sets. A list of open questions is provided too, and the consequences on the protein structure prediction problem is finally investigated.
q-bio.BM:The notion of energy landscapes provides conceptual tools for understanding the complexities of protein folding and function. Energy Landscape Theory indicates that it is much easier to find sequences that satisfy the "Principle of Minimal Frustration" when the folded structure is symmetric (Wolynes, P. G. Symmetry and the Energy Landscapes of Biomolecules. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996, 93, 14249-14255). Similarly, repeats and structural mosaics may be fundamentally related to landscapes with multiple embedded funnels. Here we present analytical tools to detect and compare structural repetitions in protein molecules. By an exhaustive analysis of the distribution of structural repeats using a robust metric we define those portions of a protein molecule that best describe the overall structure as a tessellation of basic units. The patterns produced by such tessellations provide intuitive representations of the repeating regions and their association towards higher order arrangements. We find that some protein architectures can be described as nearly periodic, while in others clear separations between repetitions exist. Since the method is independent of amino acid sequence information we can identify structural units that can be encoded by a variety of distinct amino acid sequences.
q-bio.BM:Proteins experience a wide variety of conformational dynamics that can be crucial for facilitating their diverse functions. How is the intrinsic flexibility required for these motions encoded in their three-dimensional structures? Here, the overall flexibility of a protein is demonstrated to be tightly coupled to the total amount of surface area buried within its fold. A simple proxy for this, the relative solvent accessible surface area (Arel), therefore shows excellent agreement with independent measures of global protein flexibility derived from various experimental and computational methods. Application of Arel on a large scale demonstrates its utility by revealing unique sequence and structural properties associated with intrinsic flexibility. In particular, flexibility as measured by Arel shows little correspondence with intrinsic disorder, but instead tends to be associated with multiple domains and increased {\alpha}- helical structure. Furthermore, the apparent flexibility of monomeric proteins is found to be useful for identifying quaternary structure errors in published crystal structures. There is also a strong tendency for the crystal structures of more flexible proteins to be solved to lower resolutions. Finally, local solvent accessibility is shown to be a primary determinant of local residue flexibility. Overall this work provides both fundamental mechanistic insight into the origin of protein flexibility and a simple, practical method for predicting flexibility from protein structures.
q-bio.BM:Protein structure prediction is one of the most important problems in computational biology. The most successful computational approach, also called template-based modeling, identifies templates with solved crystal structures for the query proteins and constructs three dimensional models based on sequence/structure alignments. Although substantial effort has been made to improve protein sequence alignment, the accuracy of alignments between distantly related proteins is still unsatisfactory. In this thesis, I will introduce a number of statistical machine learning methods to build accurate alignments between a protein sequence and its template structures, especially for proteins having only distantly related templates. For a protein with only one good template, we develop a regression-tree based Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model for pairwise protein sequence/structure alignment. By learning a nonlinear threading scoring function, we are able to leverage the correlation among different sequence and structural features. We also introduce an information-theoretic measure to guide the learning algorithm to better exploit the structural features for low-homology proteins with little evolutionary information in their sequence profile. For a protein with multiple good templates, we design a probabilistic consistency approach to thread the protein to all templates simultaneously. By minimizing the discordance between the pairwise alignments of the protein and templates, we are able to construct a multiple sequence/structure alignment, which leads to better structure predictions than any single-template based prediction.
q-bio.BM:The entire T7 bacteriophage genome contains 39937 base pairs (Database NCBI RefSeq N1001604). Here, electrostatic potential distribution around double helical T7 DNA was calculated by Coulomb method using the computer program of Sorokin A.A. Electrostatic profiles of 17 promoters recognized by T7 phage specific RNA polymerase were analyzed. It was shown that electrostatic profiles of all T7 RNA polymerase specific promoters can be characterized by distinctive motifs which are specific for each promoter class. Comparative analysis of electrostatic profiles of native T7 promoters of different classes demonstrates that T7 RNA polymerase can differentiate them due to their electrostatic features.
q-bio.BM:The primary structure of proteins, that is their sequence, represents one of the most abundant set of experimental data concerning biomolecules. The study of correlations in families of co--evolving proteins by means of an inverse Ising--model approach allows to obtain information on their native conformation. Following up on a recent development along this line, we optimize the algorithm to calculate effective energies between the residues, validating the approach both back-calculating interaction energies in a model system, and predicting the free energies associated to mutations in real systems. Making use of these effective energies, we study the networks of interactions which stabilizes the native conformation of some well--studied proteins, showing that it display different properties than the associated contact network.
q-bio.BM:Plasmodium falciparum 70 kDa heat shock proteins (PfHsp70s) are expressed at all stages of the pathogenic erythrocytic phase of the malaria parasite lifecycle. There are six PfHsp70s, all of which have orthologues in other plasmodial species, except for PfHsp70-x which is unique to P. falciparum. This paper highlights a number of original results obtained by a detailed bioinformatics analysis of the protein. Large scale sequence analysis indicated the presence of an extended transit peptide sequence of PfHsp70-x which potentially directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further analysis showed that PfHsp70-x does not have an ER-retention sequence, suggesting that the protein transits through the ER and is secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) or beyond into the erythrocyte cytosol. These results are consistent with experimental findings. Next, possible interactions between PfHsp70-x and exported P. falciparum Hsp40s or host erythrocyte DnaJs were interrogated by modeling and docking. Docking results indicated that interaction between PfHsp70-x and each of the Hsp40s, regardless of biological feasibility, seems equally likely. This suggests that J domain might not provide the specificity in the formation of unique Hsp70-Hsp40 complexes, but that the specificity might be provided by other domains of Hsp40s. By studying different structural conformations of PfHsp70-x, it was shown that Hsp40s can only bind when PfHsp70-x is in a certain conformation. Additionally, this work highlighted the possible dependence of the substrate binding domain residues on the orientation of the {\alpha}-helical lid for formation of the substrate binding pocket.
q-bio.BM:Most available antimicrobial peptides (AMP) prediction methods use common approach for different classes of AMP. Contrary to available approaches, we suggest, that a strategy of prediction should be based on the fact, that there are several kinds of AMP which are vary in mechanisms of action, structure, mode of interaction with membrane etc. According to our suggestion for each kind of AMP a particular approach has to be developed in order to get high efficacy. Consequently in this paper a particular but the biggest class of AMP - linear cationic antimicrobial peptides (LCAP) - has been considered and a newly developed simple method of LCAP prediction described. The aim of this study is the development of a simple method of discrimination of AMP from non-AMP, the efficiency of which will be determined by efficiencies of selected descriptors only and comparison the results of the discrimination procedure with the results obtained by more complicated discriminative methods. As descriptors the physicochemical characteristics responsible for capability of the peptide to interact with an anionic membrane were considered. The following characteristics such as hydrophobicity, amphiphaticity, location of the peptide in relation to membrane, charge, propensity to disordered structure were studied. On the basis of these characteristics a new simple algorithm of prediction is developed and evaluation of efficacies of the characteristics as descriptors performed. The results show that three descriptors: hydrophobic moment, charge and location of the peptide along the membranes can be used as discriminators of LCAPs. For the training set our method gives the same level of accuracy as more complicated machine learning approaches offered as CAMP database service tools. For the test set sensitivity obtained by our method gives even higher value than the one obtained by CAMP prediction tools.
q-bio.BM:Development of the new antimicrobial agents against antibiotic resistance pathogens is the nowadays challenge. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) occur as important defence agents in many organisms and offer a viable alternative to conventional antibiotics. Therefore they have become increasingly recognized in current research as templates for prospective antibiotic agents. The efficient designing of the new antimicrobials on the basis of antimicrobial peptides requires comprehensive knowledge on those general physical-chemical characteristics which allow to differ antimicrobial peptides from non-active against microbs ones. According to supposed mechanisms of action, AMP interact with and physically disrupt the bacterial membranes. Consequently, hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity and intrinsic aggregation propensities are considered as such major characteristics of the peptide, which determine the results of peptide-membrane interactions. For some kind of peptides such characteristics as hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity and aggregation bias determines their ability to compose transmembrane domain of the membrane protein, whilst for others the same properties are respond for their antimicrpobial activity, i.e. give them ability of membrane permeability and its damage. In this review we analyze the data about hydrophobicity, amphiphilicity and intrinsic aggregation propensities available in literature in order to compare antimicrobial and transmembrane peptides and show what is the common and what is the difference in this respect between them.
q-bio.BM:Quantum mechanical calculations are performed on the proteins that constitute the ubiquitin-Dsk2 complex whose atomic structure has been experimentally determined by NMR spectroscopy (PDB id 1WR1). The results indicate that the dipole moment vectors of the two proteins are aligned in a head-to-tail orientation while forming and angle of ~130{\deg}. Hence, attractive dipole-dipole interactions not only stabilize the protein-protein complex but they are likely to favor the correct orientation of the proteins during the formation of the complex.
q-bio.BM:Quantum mechanical calculations are performed on 116 conformers of the protein ubiquitin (Lange et al., Science 2008, 320, 1471-1475). The results indicate that the heat of formation (HOF), dipole moment, energy of the frontier orbitals HOMO and LUMO, and HOMO-LUMO gap fluctuate within their corresponding ranges. This study thus provides a link between the conformational dynamics of a protein and its electronic structure.
q-bio.BM:Van der Waals density functional theory is integrated with analysis of a non-redundant set of protein-DNA crystal structures from the Nucleic Acid Database to study the stacking energetics of CG:CG base-pair steps, specifically the role of cytosine 5-methylation. Principal component analysis of the steps reveals the dominant collective motions to correspond to a tensile 'opening' mode and two shear 'sliding' and 'tearing' modes in the orthogonal plane. The stacking interactions of the methyl groups globally inhibit CG:CG step overtwisting while simultaneously softening the modes locally via potential energy modulations that create metastable states. Additionally, the indirect effects of the methyl groups on possible base-pair steps neighboring CG:CG are observed to be of comparable importance to their direct effects on CG:CG. The results have implications for the epigenetic control of DNA mechanics.
q-bio.BM:Protein function depends on both protein structure and amino acid (aa) sequence. Here we show that modular features of both structure and function can be quantified from the aa sequence alone for the amyloid 770 aa precursor protein A4. Both the new second order hydropathicity scale, based on evolutionary optimization (self-organized criticality), and the standard first order scale, based on complete protein (water-air) unfolding, yield thermodynamically significant features of amyloid function related to spinodal decomposition into modules. Spinodal crossings are marked by breaks in slope of algebraic functions of aa sequences. The new scale is associated with a lower effective temperature than the standard scale.
q-bio.BM:Standard models of ion channel voltage gating require substantial movement of one transmembrane segment, S4, of the voltage sensing domain. Evidence comes from the accessibility to external methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of the positively charged arginine residues (R) on this segment. These are first mutated to cysteines (C), which in turn react with MTS reagents; it is assumed that the C is passively carried in the S4 movement, becoming accessible on one side or the other of the membrane. However, the Rs were salt bridged to negatively charged residues on other transmembrane segments, or hydrogen bonded, while C reacts as a negative ion. The space available for MTS is fairly close to the difference in volume between the large R residue and much smaller C, so the MTS is not severely sterically hindered. A reagent molecule can reach a C side chain; the C can react if not repelled by a negative charge from the amino acid to which the R had been salt bridged. Nearby protons may also make reaction possible unless the C itself is protonated. Therefore interpretation of the C substitution results requires reconsideration. To test the idea we have done quantum calculations on part of a mutated S4 and the nearby section of the channel. The mutation is R300C of the 2A79/3Lut structure, a mutation that would be done to test MTS reagent access; there is a large cavity where the R is replaced by C. Two quantum calculations show a substantial difference in the structure of this cavity with 2 water molecules compared to 4. This suggests that the structure, and presumably reaction probability, could depend on water molecules, very likely also protons, in or near the cavity that the R300C mutation produces.
q-bio.BM:Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) co-crystallisation conditions of carboplatin without sodium chloride (NaCl) have been utilised to eliminate partial conversion of carboplatin to cisplatin observed previously. Tetragonal HEWL crystals were successfully obtained in 65% MPD with 0.1M citric acid buffer at pH 4.0 including DMSO. The X-ray diffraction data resolution to be used for the model refinement was reviewed using several topical criteria together. The CC1/2 criterion implemented in XDS led to data being significant to 2.0{\AA}, compared to the data only being able to be processed to 3.0{\AA} using the Bruker software package (SAINT). Then using paired protein model refinements and DPI values based on the FreeR value, the resolution limit was fine tuned to be 2.3{\AA}. Interestingly this was compared with results from the EVAL software package which gave a resolution limit of 2.2{\AA} solely using <I/sigI> crossing 2, but 2.8{\AA} based on the Rmerge values (60%). The structural results showed that carboplatin bound to only the N{\delta} binding site of His-15 one week after crystal growth, whereas five weeks after crystal growth, two molecules of carboplatin are bound to the His-15 residue. In summary several new results have emerged: - firstly non-NaCl conditions showed a carboplatin molecule bound to His-15 of HEWL; secondly binding of one molecule of carboplatin was seen after one week of crystal growth and two molecules were bound after five weeks of crystal growth; and thirdly the use of several criteria to determine the diffraction resolution limit led to the successful use of data to higher resolution.
q-bio.BM:The original ideas of Cooper and Dryden, that allosteric signalling can be induced between distant binding sites on proteins without any change in mean structural conformation, has proved to be a remarkably prescient insight into the rich structure of protein dynamics. It represents an alternative to the celebrated Monod-Wyman-Changeux mechanism and proposes that modulation of the amplitude of thermal fluctuations around a mean structure, rather than shifts in the structure itself, give rise to allostery in ligand binding. In a complementary approach to experiments on real proteins, here we take a theoretical route to identify the necessary structural components of this mechanism. By reviewing and extending an approach that moves from very coarse-grained to more detailed models, we show that, a fundamental requirement for a body supporting fluctuation-induced allostery is a strongly inhomogeneous elastic modulus. This requirement is reflected in many real proteins, where a good approximation of the elastic structure maps strongly coherent domains onto rigid blocks connected by more flexible interface regions.
q-bio.BM:The heat shock organizing protein (Hop) is important in modulating the activity and co-interaction of two chaperones: heat shock protein 70 and 90 (Hsp70 and Hsp90). Recent research suggested that Plasmodium falciparum Hop (PfHop), PfHsp70 and PfHsp90 form a complex in the trophozoite infective stage. However, there has been little computational research on the malarial Hop protein in complex with other malarial Hsps. Using in silico characterization of the protein, this work showed that individual domains of Hop are evolving at different rates within the protein. Differences between human Hop (HsHop) and PfHop were identified by motif analysis. Homology modeling of PfHop and HsHop in complex with their own cytosolic Hsp90 and Hsp70 C-terminal peptide partners indicated excellent conservation of the Hop concave TPR sites bound to the C-terminal motifs of partner proteins. Further, we analyzed additional binding sites between Hop and Hsp90, and showed, for the first time, that they are distinctly less conserved between human and malaria parasite. These sites are located on the convex surface of Hop TPR2, and involved in interactions with the Hsp90 middle domain. Since the convex sites are less conserved than the concave sites, it makes their potential for malarial inhibitor design extremely attractive (as opposed to the concave sites which have been the focus of previous efforts).
q-bio.BM:An intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) lacks a stable three-dimensional structure, while it folds into a specific structure when it binds to a target molecule. In some IDP-target complexes, not all target binding surfaces are exposed on the outside, and intermediate states are observed in their binding processes. We consider that stepwise target recognition via intermediate states is a characteristic of IDP binding to targets with "hidden" binding sites. To investigate IDP binding to hidden target binding sites, we constructed an IDP lattice model based on the HP model. In our model, the IDP is modeled as a chain and the target is modeled as a highly coarse-grained object. We introduced motion and internal interactions to the target to hide its binding sites. In the case of unhidden binding sites, a two-state transition between the free states and a bound state is observed, and we consider that this represents coupled folding and binding. Introducing hidden binding sites, we found an intermediate bound state in which the IDP forms various structures to temporarily stabilize the complex. The intermediate state provides a scaffold for the IDP to access the hidden binding site. We call this process multiform binding. We conclude that structural flexibility of IDPs enables them to access hidden binding sites, and this is a functional advantage of IDPs.
q-bio.BM:Mapping between sequence and structure is currently an open problem in structural biology. Despite many experimental and computational efforts it is not clear yet how the structure is encoded in the sequence. Answering this question may pave the way for predicting a protein fold given its sequence.   My doctoral studies have focused on a particular phenomenon relevant to the protein sequence-structure relationship. It has been observed that many proteins having apparently dissimilar sequences share the same native fold. The phenomenon of mapping many divergent sequences into a single fold raises the question of which positions along the sequence are important for the conservation of fold and function in dissimilar sequences. Detecting those positions, and classifying them according to role can help understand which elements in a sequence are important for maintenance of structure and/or function. In the course of my doctoral research I have attempted to discover and characterize those positions.
q-bio.BM:Protein function depends on both protein structure and amino acid (aa) sequence. Here we show that modular features of both structure and function can be quantified from the aa sequences alone for the small (40,42 aa) plaque-forming amyloid beta fragments. Some edge and center features of the fragments are predicted. Contrasting results from the second order hydropathicity scale based on evolutionary optimization (self-organized criticality) and the first order scale based on complete protein (water-air) unfolding show that fragmentation has mixed first- and second-order character.
q-bio.BM:Large-scale DNA deformation is ubiquitous in transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike. Though much is known about how transcription factors and constellations of binding sites dictate where and how gene regulation will occur, less is known about the role played by the intervening DNA. In this work we explore the effect of sequence flexibility on transcription factor-mediated DNA looping, by drawing on sequences identified in nucleosome formation and ligase-mediated cyclization assays as being especially favorable for or resistant to large deformations. We examine a poly(dA:dT)-rich, nucleosome-repelling sequence that is often thought to belong to a class of highly inflexible DNAs; two strong nucleosome positioning sequences that share a set of particular sequence features common to nucleosome-preferring DNAs; and a CG-rich sequence representative of high G+C-content genomic regions that correlate with high nucleosome occupancy in vivo. To measure the flexibility of these sequences in the context of DNA looping, we combine the in vitro single-molecule tethered particle motion assay, a canonical looping protein, and a statistical mechan- ical model that allows us to quantitatively relate the looping probability to the looping free energy. We show that, in contrast to the case of nucleosome occupancy, G+C content does not positively correlate with looping probability, and that despite sharing sequence features that are thought to determine nucleosome affinity, the two strong nucleosome positioning sequences behave markedly dissimilarly in the context of looping. Most surprisingly, the poly(dA:dT)-rich DNA that is often characterized as highly inflexible in fact exhibits one of the highest propensities for looping that we have measured.
q-bio.BM:DNA Polymerase is an enzyme that participates in the process of DNA replication. In general, forward DNA polymerase moves along the template strand in a 3'-5' direction, and the daughter strand is formed in a 5'-3' direction. This paper theoretically analyzes the mechanism of forward DNA polymerase, and gives the design proposal of a new reverse DNA polymerase (3'-5' direction).
q-bio.BM:Different models such as diffusion-collision and nucleation-condensation have been used to unravel how secondary and tertiary structures form during protein folding. However, a simple mechanism based on physical principles that provide an accurate description of kinetics and thermodynamics for such phenomena has not yet been identified. This study introduces the hypothesis that the synchronization of the peptide plane oscillatory movements throughout the backbone must also play a key role in the folding mechanism. Based on that, we draw a parallel between the folding process and the dynamics for a network of coupled oscillators described by the Kuramoto model. The amino acid coupling may explain the mean-field character of the force that propels an amino acid sequence into a structure through self-organization. Thus, the pattern of synchronized cluster formation and growing helps to solve the Levinthal's paradox.Synchronization may also help us to understand the success of homology structural modeling, allosteric effect, and the mechanism responsible for the recognition of odorants by olfactory receptors.
q-bio.BM:RNA protein interactions control the fate of cellular RNAs and play an important role in gene regulation. An interdependency between such interactions allows for the implementation of logic functions in gene regulation. We investigate the interplay between RNA binding partners in the context of the statistical physics of RNA secondary structure, and define a linear correlation function between the two partners as a measurement of the interdependency of their binding events. We demonstrate the emergence of a long-range power-law behavior of this linear correlation function. This suggests RNA secondary structure driven interdependency between binding sites as a general mechanism for combinatorial post-transcriptional gene regulation.
q-bio.BM:The inositol trisphosphate receptor (IPR) is a crucial ion channel that regulates the Ca$^{2+}$ influx from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytoplasm. A thorough study of the IPR channel contributes to a better understanding of calcium oscillations and waves. It has long been observed that the IPR channel is a typical biological system which performs adaptation. However, recent advances on the physical essence of adaptation show that adaptation systems with a negative feedback mechanism, such as the IPR channel, must break detailed balance and always operate out of equilibrium with energy dissipation. Almost all previous IPR models are equilibrium models assuming detailed balance and thus violate the physical essence of adaptation. In this article, we constructed a nonequilibrium allosteric model of single IPR channels based on the patch-clamp experimental data obtained from the IPR in the outer membranes of isolated nuclei of the \emph{Xenopus} oocyte. It turns out that our model reproduces the patch-clamp experimental data reasonably well and produces both the correct steady-state and dynamic properties of the channel. Particularly, our model successfully describes the complicated bimodal [Ca$^{2+}$] dependence of the mean open duration at high [IP$_3$], a steady-state behavior which fails to be correctly described in previous IPR models. Finally, we used the patch-clamp experimental data to validate that the IPR channel indeed breaks detailed balance and thus is a nonequilibrium system which consumes energy.
q-bio.BM:English version of abstract   A growing number of scientific researches have been demonstrating that olive oil operates a crucial role on the prevention of cardiovascular and tumoral diseases, being related with low mortality and morbidity in populations that tend to follow a Mediterranean diet. Amongst its minor components, polyphenols have been subject to several clinical trials that have established health benefits associated to their antioxidant, antitumoral and anti-atherosclerotic activity. However the biological activity of polyphenols is dependent not only of their absorption but also of their metabolization. Bioavailability studies have demonstrated that after olive oil intake, not only hydroxytyrosol but also its metabolites can be found in plasma, such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillyl alcohol and its glucoronides.   -----   Portuguese version of abstract   Um numero crescente de pesquisas cientificas demonstram que o azeite opera um papel crucial na preven\c{c}ao de doen\c{c}as cardiovasculares e doen\c{c}as tumorais, estando relacionado com a baixa mortalidade e morbilidade em popula\c{c}oes que tradicionalmente seguem uma dieta Mediterranica.

q-bio.BM:The three-dimensional conformations of non-coding RNAs underpin their biochemical functions but have largely eluded experimental characterization. Here, we report that integrating a classic mutation/rescue strategy with high-throughput chemical mapping enables rapid RNA structure inference with unusually strong validation. We revisit a paradigmatic 16S rRNA domain for which SHAPE (selective 2`-hydroxyl acylation with primer extension) suggested a conformational change between apo- and holo-ribosome conformations. Computational support estimates, data from alternative chemical probes, and mutate-and-map (M2) experiments expose limitations of prior methodology and instead give a near-crystallographic secondary structure. Systematic interrogation of single base pairs via a high-throughput mutation/rescue approach then permits incisive validation and refinement of the M2-based secondary structure and further uncovers the functional conformation as an excited state (25+/-5% population) accessible via a single-nucleotide register shift. These results correct an erroneous SHAPE inference of a ribosomal conformational change and suggest a general mutate-map-rescue approach for dissecting RNA dynamic structure landscapes.
q-bio.BM:The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, which serves as a model system for mechanosensitive channels, has previously been crystallized in the closed form, but not in the open form. Ensemble measurements and electrophysiological sieving experiments show that the open-diameter of the channel pore is >25{\AA}, but the exact size and whether the conformational change follows a helix-tilt or barrel-stave model are unclear. Here we report measurements of the distance changes on liposome-reconstituted MscL transmembrane {\alpha}-helices, using a "virtual sorting" single-molecule fluorescence energy transfer. We observed directly that the channel opens via the helix-tilt model and the open pore reaches 2.8 nm in diameter. In addition, based on the measurements, we developed a molecular dynamics model of the channel structure in the open state which confirms our direct observations.
q-bio.BM:Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) comprise a powerful class of tools that are redefining the boundaries of biological research. Although these technologies have begun to enable targeted genome modifications, there remains a need for new technologies that are affordable, scalable, and easy to engineer. In this paper, we propose a new tool for genetic engineering, the pseudocomplementary peptide nucleic acid nucleases (pcPNANs), which are composed of a pseudocomplementary PNA (pcPNA) specific for a DNA target sequence, a FokI nuclease cleavage domain and a nuclear localization signal. pcPNANs may induce targeted DNA double-strand breaks that activate DNA damage response pathways and enable custom alterations. Their cleavage-site is determined by simple Watson-Crick rule, and thus pcPNANs for aimed cleavage of genomes can be straightforwardly designed and synthesized without any selection procedure. Accordingly, the cleavage-site and site-specificity are freely chosen by changing the sequences and the lengths of pcPNA strands. We believe that the potentiality of pcPNAN as a new tool for genetic engineering will be confirmed in the future.
q-bio.BM:The current capacity of computers makes it possible to perform simulations of small systems with portable, explicit-solvent potentials achieving high degree of accuracy. However, simplified models must be employed to exploit the behaviour of large systems or to perform systematic scans of smaller systems. While powerful algorithms are available to facilitate the sampling of the conformational space, successful applications of such models are hindered by the availability of simple enough potentials able to satisfactorily reproduce known properties of the system. We develop an interatomic potential to account for a number of properties of proteins in a computationally economic way. The potential is defined within an all-atom, implicit solvent model by contact functions between the different atom types. The associated numerical values can be optimised by an iterative Monte Carlo scheme on any available experimental data, provided that they are expressible as thermal averages of some conformational properties. We test this model on three different proteins, for which we also perform a scan of all possible point mutations with explicit conformational sampling. The resulting models, optimised solely on a subset of native distances, not only reproduce the native conformations within a few Angstroms from the experimental ones, but show the cooperative transition between native and denatured state and correctly predict the measured free--energy changes associated with point mutations. Moreover, differently from other structure-based models, our method leaves a residual degree of frustration, which is known to be present in protein molecules.
q-bio.BM:F1-ATPase is the soluble portion of the membrane-embedded enzyme FoF1-ATP synthase that catalyzes the production of adenosine triphosphate in eukaryotic and eubacterial cells. In reverse, the F1 part can also hydrolyze ATP quickly at three catalytic binding sites. Therefore, catalysis of 'non-productive' ATP hydrolysis by F1 (or FoF1) must be minimized in the cell. In bacteria, the epsilon subunit is thought to control and block ATP hydrolysis by mechanically inserting its C-terminus into the rotary motor region of F1. We investigate this proposed mechanism by labeling F1 specifically with two fluorophores to monitor the C-terminus of the epsilon subunit by F\"orster resonance energy transfer. Single F1 molecules are trapped in solution by an Anti-Brownian electrokinetic trap which keeps the FRET-labeled F1 in place for extended observation times of several hundreds of milliseconds, limited by photobleaching. FRET changes in single F1 and FRET histograms for different biochemical conditions are compared to evaluate the proposed regulatory mechanism.
q-bio.BM:Subunit epsilon is an intrinsic regulator of the bacterial FoF1-ATP synthase, the ubiquitous membrane-embedded enzyme that utilizes a proton motive force in most organisms to synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The C-terminal domain of epsilon can extend into the central cavity formed by the alpha and beta subunits, as revealed by the recent X-ray structure of the F1 portion of the Escherichia coli enzyme. This insertion blocks the rotation of the central gamma subunit and, thereby, prevents wasteful ATP hydrolysis. Here we aim to develop an experimental system that can reveal conditions under which epsilon inhibits the holoenzyme FoF1-ATP synthase in vitro. Labeling the C-terminal domain of epsilon and the gamma subunit specifically with two different fluorophores for single-molecule Foerster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) allowed monitoring of the conformation of epsilon in the reconstituted enzyme in real time. New mutants were made for future three-color smFRET experiments to unravel the details of regulatory conformational changes in epsilon.
q-bio.BM:This paper presents and tests a previously unrecognised mechanism for driving a replicating molecular system on the prebiotic earth. It is proposed that cell-free RNA replication in the primordial soup may have been driven by self-sustained oscillatory thermochemical reactions. To test this hypothesis a well-characterised hydrogen peroxide oscillator was chosen as the driver and complementary RNA strands with known association and melting kinetics were used as the substrate. An open flow system model for the self-consistent, coupled evolution of the temperature and concentrations in a simple autocatalytic scheme is solved numerically, and it is shown that thermochemical cycling drives replication of the RNA strands. For the (justifiably realistic) values of parameters chosen for the simulated example system, the mean amount of replicant produced at steady state is 6.56 times the input amount, given a constant supply of substrate species. The spontaneous onset of sustained thermochemical oscillations via slowly drifting parameters is demonstrated, and a scheme is given for prebiotic production of complementary RNA strands on rock surfaces.
q-bio.BM:We have studied the apo (Fe3+ free) form of periplasmic ferric binding protein (FbpA) under different conditions and we have monitored the changes in the binding and release dynamics of H2PO4- that acts as a synergistic anion in the presence of Fe3+. Our simulations predict a dissociation constant of 2.2$\pm$0.2 mM which is in remarkable agreement with the experimentally measured value of 2.3$\pm$0.3 mM under the same ionization strength and pH conditions. We apply perturbations relevant for changes in environmental conditions as (i) different values of ionic strength (IS), and (ii) protonation of a group of residues to mimic a different pH environment. Local perturbations are also studied by protonation or mutation of a site distal to the binding region that is known to mechanically manipulate the hinge-like motions of FbpA. We find that while the average conformation of the protein is intact in all simulations, the H2PO4- dynamics may be substantially altered by the changing conditions. In particular, the bound fraction which is 20$\%$ for the wild type system is increased to 50$\%$ with a D52A mutation/protonation and further to over 90$\%$ at the protonation conditions mimicking those at pH 5.5. The change in the dynamics is traced to the altered electrostatic distribution on the surface of the protein which in turn affects hydrogen bonding patterns at the active site. The observations are quantified by rigorous free energy calculations. Our results lend clues as to how the environment versus single residue perturbations may be utilized for regulation of binding modes in hFbpA systems in the absence of conformational changes.
q-bio.BM:Motivation: Identification of flexible regions of protein structures is important for understanding of their biological functions. Recently, we have developed a fast approach for predicting protein structure fluctuations from a single protein model: the CABS-flex. CABS-flex was shown to be an efficient alternative to conventional all-atom molecular dynamics (MD). In this work, we evaluate CABS-flex and MD predictions by comparison with protein structural variations within NMR ensembles.   Results: Based on a benchmark set of 140 proteins, we show that the relative fluctuations of protein residues obtained from CABS-flex are well correlated to those of NMR ensembles. On average, this correlation is stronger than that between MD and NMR ensembles. In conclusion, CABS-flex is useful and complementary to MD in predicting of protein regions that undergo conformational changes and the extent of such changes.
q-bio.BM:RNA secondary structure prediction and classification are two important problems in the field of RNA biology. Here, we propose a new permutation based approach to create logical non-disjoint clusters of different secondary structures of a single class or type. Many different types of techniques exist to classify RNA secondary structure data but none of them have ever used permutation based approach which is very simple and yet powerful. We have written a small JAVA program to generate permutation, apply our algorithm on those permutations and analyze the data and create different logical clusters. We believe that these clusters can be utilized to untangle the mystery of RNA secondary structure and analyze the development patterns of unknown RNA.
q-bio.BM:To obtain an electron-density map from a macromolecular crystal the phase-problem needs to be solved, which often involves the use of heavy-atom derivative crystals and concomitantly the determination of the heavy atom substructure. This is customarily done by direct methods or Patterson-based approaches, which however may fail when only poorly diffracting derivative crystals are available, as often the case for e.g. membrane proteins. Here we present an approach for heavy atom site identification based on a Molecular Replacement Parameter Matrix (MRPM) search. It involves an n-dimensional search to test a wide spectrum of molecular replacement parameters, such as clusters of different conformations. The result is scored by the ability to identify heavy-atom positions, from anomalous difference Fourier maps, that allow meaningful phases to be determined. The strategy was successfully applied in the determination of a membrane protein structure, the CopA Cu+-ATPase, when other methods had failed to resolve the heavy atom substructure. MRPM is particularly suited for proteins undergoing large conformational changes where multiple search models should be generated, and it enables the identification of weak but correct molecular replacement solutions with maximum contrast to prime experimental phasing efforts.
q-bio.BM:Understanding protein folding has been one of the great challenges in biochemistry and molecular biophysics. Over the past 50 years, many thermodynamic and kinetic studies have been performed addressing the stability of globular proteins. In comparison, advances in the membrane protein folding field lag far behind. Although membrane proteins constitute about a third of the proteins encoded in known genomes, stability studies on membrane proteins have been impaired due to experimental limitations. Furthermore, no systematic experimental strategies are available for folding these biomolecules in vitro. Common denaturing agents such as chaotropes usually do not work on helical membrane proteins, and ionic detergents have been successful denaturants only in few cases. Refolding a membrane protein seems to be a craftsman work, which is relatively straightforward for transmembrane {\beta}-barrel proteins but challenging for {\alpha}-helical membrane proteins. Additional complexities emerge in multidomain membrane proteins, data interpretation being one of the most critical. In this review, we will describe some recent efforts in understanding the folding mechanism of membrane proteins that have been reversibly refolded allowing both thermodynamic and kinetic analysis. This information will be discussed in the context of current paradigms in the protein folding field.
q-bio.BM:Molecular docking is a central method in the computer-based screening of compound libraries as a part of the rational approach to drug design. Although the method has proved its competence in predicting binding modes correctly, its inherent complexity puts high demands on computational resources. Moreover the chemical space to be screened is prohibitively large. Therefore the application of filtering prior to docking is a promising concept. We implemented a pre-docking filter based on the tangent distance algorithm originally conceived for optical character recognition. The challenging transfer of the method from two-dimensional to three-dimensional data was achieved by representing the molecular structure by a set of density maps extracted from different views of the compound. Additionally, our program applies a binary classification using principal component analysis. Ligand and binding pocket are aligned according to their centroidal axes, enabling a size-based filtering for the purpose of enriching the dataset regarding ligands before docking. The evaluation of our program via redocking produced RMSD values between 8{\AA} and 25{\AA}, indicating that the tangent distance approach is not suited for optimizing the orientation of a ligand and binding pocket. Investigating probable explanations lead to the conclusion that a likely cause for these results is the method's known inability to approximate large transformations. A validation of the principal component analysis alone performed better: Tests on a dataset of 170 ligands and 6,435 decoys yielded a sensitivity of 0.81, while keeping the runtime within a reasonable timeframe (1 to 4 seconds). The dataset's enrichment increased from 2.64% to 2.82%.
q-bio.BM:Energy landscapes provide a valuable means for studying the folding dynamics of short RNA molecules in detail by modeling all possible structures and their transitions. Higher abstraction levels based on a macro-state decomposition of the landscape enable the study of larger systems, however they are still restricted by huge memory requirements of exact approaches.   We present a highly parallelizable local enumeration scheme that enables the computation of exact macro-state transition models with highly reduced memory requirements. The approach is evaluated on RNA secondary structure landscapes using a gradient basin definition for macro-states. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for exact transition models by comparing two barrier-based appoaches and perform a detailed investigation of gradient basins in RNA energy landscapes.   Source code is part of the C++ Energy Landscape Library available at http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/.
q-bio.BM:Escherichia coli DNA polymerase V (pol V), a heterotrimeric complex composed of UmuD'2C, is marginally active. ATP and RecA play essential roles in the activation of pol V for DNA synthesis including translesion synthesis (TLS). We have established three features of the roles of ATP and RecA. 1) RecA-activated DNA polymerase V (pol V Mut), is a DNA-dependent ATPase; 2) bound ATP is required for DNA synthesis; 3) pol V Mut function is regulated by ATP, with ATP required to bind primer/template (p/t) DNA and ATP hydrolysis triggering dissociation from the DNA. Pol V Mut formed with an ATPase-deficient RecA E38K/K72R mutant hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, establishing the DNA-dependent ATPase as an intrinsic property of pol V Mut distinct from the ATP hydrolytic activity of RecA when bound to single-stranded (ss)DNA as a nucleoprotein filament (RecA*). No similar ATPase activity or autoregulatory mechanism has previously been found for a DNA polymerase.
q-bio.BM:Proteins belonging to immunoglobulin superfamily(IgSF) show remarkably conserved nature both in their folded structure and in their folding process, but they neither originate from very similar sequences nor demonstrate functional conservation. Treating proteins as fractal objects, without studying spatial conservation in positioning of particular residues in IgSF, this work probed the roots structural invariance of immunoglobulins(Ig). Symmetry in distribution of mass, hydrophobicity, polarizability recorded very similar extents in Ig and in structurally-closest non-Ig structures. They registered similar symmetries in dipole-dipole, {\pi}-{\pi}, cation-{\pi} cloud interactions and also in distribution of active chiral centers, charged residues and hydrophobic residues. But in contrast to non-Ig proteins, extents of residual interaction symmetries in Ig.s of largely varying sizes are found to converge to exactly same magnitude of correlation dimension - these are named 'structural attractors', who's weightages depend on ensuring exact convergence of pairwise-interaction symmetries to attractor magnitude. Small basin of attraction for Ig attractors explained the strict and consistent quality control in ensuring stability and functionality of IgSF proteins. Low dependency of attractor weightage on attractor magnitude demonstrated that residual-interaction symmetry with less pervasive nature can also be crucial in ensuring Ig stability.
q-bio.BM:HiRE-RNA is a simplified, coarse-grained RNA model for the prediction of equilibrium configurations, dynamics and thermodynamics. Using a reduced set of particles and detailed interactions accounting for base-pairing and stacking we show that non-canonical and multiple base interactions are necessary to capture the full physical behavior of complex RNAs. In this paper we give a full account of the model and we present results on the folding, stability and free energy surfaces of 16 systems with 12 to 76 nucleotides of increasingly complex architectures, ranging from monomers to dimers, using a total of 850$\mu$s simulation time.
q-bio.BM:The active sites of enzymes consist of residues necessary for catalysis, and structurally important non-catalytic residues that together maintain the architecture and function of the active site. Examples of evolutionary interactions between active site residue have been difficult to define and experimentally validate due to a general intolerance to substitution. Here, using computational methods to predict co-evolving residues, we identify a network of positions consisting of two catalytic metal-binding residues and two adjacent non- catalytic residues in LAGLIDADG family homing endonucleases (LHEs). Distinct combinations of residues in the network map to clades of LHE sub-families, with a striking distribution of the metal-binding Asp (D) and Glu (E) residues. Mutation of these four positions in two LHEs, I-LtrI and I-OnuI, indicate that combinations of residues tolerated are specific to each enzyme. Kinetic analyses under single-turnover conditions indicated a substantial defect in either the catalytic rate (kcat*) or the Michaelis constant (KM*) for I- LtrI variants with networks predicted to be suboptimal. Enzymatic activity could be restored to near wild-type levels with a single compensatory mutation that recreated a network of optimally predicted residues. Our results demonstrate that LHE activity is constrained by an evolutionary barrier of residues with strong context-dependent effects. Creation of optimal co-evolving active site networks is therefore an important consideration in engineering of LHEs and other enzymes.
q-bio.BM:Structural bioinformatics and van der Waals density functional theory are combined to investigate the mechanochemical impact of a major class of histone-DNA interactions, namely the formation of salt bridges between arginine residues in histones and phosphate groups on the DNA backbone. Principal component analysis reveals that the configurational fluctuations of the sugar-phosphate backbone display sequence-specific variability, and clustering of nucleosomal crystal structures identifies two major salt bridge configurations: a monodentate form in which the arginine end-group guanidinium only forms one hydrogen bond with the phosphate, and a bidentate form in which it forms two. Density functional theory calculations highlight that the combination of sequence, denticity and salt bridge positioning enable the histones to tunably activate specific backbone deformations via mechanochemical stress. The results suggest that selection for specific placements of van der Waals contacts, with high-precision control of the spatial distribution of intermolecular forces, may serve as an underlying evolutionary design principle for the structure and function of nucleosomes, a conjecture that is corroborated by previous experimental studies.
q-bio.BM:Elucidation of possible pathways between folded (native) and unfolded states of a protein is a challenging task, as the intermediates are often hard to detect. Here we alter the solvent environment in a controlled manner by choosing two different co-solvents of water, urea and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and study unfolding of four different proteins to understand the respective sequence of melting by computer simulation methods. We indeed find interesting differences in the sequence of melting of alpha-helices and beta-sheets in these two solvents. For example, at 8M urea solution, beta-sheet parts of a protein is found to unfold preferentially, followed by the unfolding of alpha helices. In contrast, 8M DMSO solution unfolds alpha helices first, followed by the separation of beta-sheets for majority of proteins. Sequence of unfolding events in four different alpha/beta proteins and also in chicken villin head piece (HP-36) both in urea and DMSO solution demonstrate that the unfolding pathways are determined jointly by relative exposure of polar and non-polar residues of a protein and the mode of molecular action of a solvent on that protein.
q-bio.BM:As part of a program to develop compounds with potential to treat cocaine abuse, eleven (+/-)-threo-methylphenidate (TMP; Ritalin) derivatives were synthesized and tested in rat striatal tissue preparations for inhibitory potency against [3H]WIN 35,428 binding (WIN) to the dopamine (DA) transporter, [3H]citalopram binding (CIT) to the serotonin transporter, and [3H]DA uptake. The ester function was replaced by other functional groups in all of the compounds; some also contained substituents on the phenyl ring and/or the piperidine nitrogen. Potencies against WIN, measured as IC50, ranged from 27 nM to 7,000 nM, compared to an IC50 of 83 nM for TMP itself. Potency against [3H]DA uptake was approximately two-fold less than that against WIN, but generally exhibited the same rank order. With one exception, the compounds were significantly less potent against CIT than WIN. The one exception, which has a rigid planar conformation at the altered ester position, is unique in that it also is much less potent against [3H]DA uptake relative to WIN, compared to the other derivatives. The three compounds with dichloro groups on the phenyl ring did not exhibit positive cooperativity, as has been observed with several previously synthesized halogenated TMP derivatives. Taken together, these compounds should help to further our understanding of the stimulant binding sites on both the dopamine and serotonin transporters.
q-bio.BM:Protein-protein interactions are fundamental to many biological processes. Experimental screens have identified tens of thousands of interactions and structural biology has provided detailed functional insight for select 3D protein complexes. An alternative rich source of information about protein interactions is the evolutionary sequence record. Building on earlier work, we show that analysis of correlated evolutionary sequence changes across proteins identifies residues that are close in space with sufficient accuracy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein complexes. We evaluate prediction performance in blinded tests on 76 complexes of known 3D structure, predict protein-protein contacts in 32 complexes of unknown structure, and demonstrate how evolutionary couplings can be used to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs in a large complex. With the current growth of sequence databases, we expect that the method can be generalized to genome-wide elucidation of protein-protein interaction networks and used for interaction predictions at residue resolution.
q-bio.BM:Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) is a method for analyzing multiple sequence alignments that was used to identify groups of coevolving residues termed "sectors". The method applies spectral analysis to a matrix obtained by combining correlation information with sequence conservation. It has been asserted that the protein sectors identified by SCA are functionally significant, with different sectors controlling different biochemical properties of the protein. Here we reconsider the available experimental data and note that it involves almost exclusively proteins with a single sector. We show that in this case sequence conservation is the dominating factor in SCA, and can alone be used to make statistically equivalent functional predictions. Therefore, we suggest shifting the experimental focus to proteins for which SCA identifies several sectors. Correlations in protein alignments, which have been shown to be informative in a number of independent studies, would then be less dominated by sequence conservation.
q-bio.BM:The growing usage of nanoparticles of zinc sulfide as quantum dots and biosensors calls for a theoretical assessment of interactions of ZnS with biomolecules. We employ the molecular-dynamics-based umbrella sampling method to determine potentials of mean force for 20 single amino acids near the ZnS (110) surface in aqueous solutions. We find that five amino acids do not bind at all and the binding energy of the remaining amino acids does not exceed 4.3 kJ/mol. Such energies are comparable to those found for ZnO (and to hydrogen bonds in proteins) but the nature of the specificity is different. Cysteine can bind with ZnS in a covalent way, e.g. by forming the disulfide bond with S in the solid. If this effect is included within a model incorporating the Morse potential, then the potential well becomes much deeper - the binding energy is close to 98 kJ/mol. We then consider tryptophan cage, a protein of 20 residues, and characterize its events of adsorption to ZnS. We demonstrate the relevance of interactions between the amino acids in the selection of optimal adsorbed conformations and recognize the key role of cysteine in generation of lasting adsorption. We show that ZnS is more hydrophobic than ZnO and that the density profile of water is quite different than that forming near ZnO - it has only a minor articulation into layers. Furthermore, the first layer of water is disordered and mobile.
q-bio.BM:We determine potentials of the mean force for interactions of amino acids with four common surfaces of ZnO in aqueous solutions. The method involves all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with the umbrella sampling technique. The profiled nature of the density of water with the strongly adsorbed first layer affects the approach of amino acids to the surface and generates either repulsion or weak binding. The largest binding energy is found for tyrosine interacting with the surface in which the Zn ions are at the top. It is equal to 7 kJ/mol which is comparable to that of the hydrogen bonds in a protein. This makes the adsorption of amino acids onto the ZnO surface much weaker than onto the well studied surface of gold. Under vacuum, binding energies are more than 40 times stronger (for one of the surfaces). The precise manner in which water molecules interact with a given surface influences the binding energies in a way that depends on the surface. Among the four considered surfaces the one with Zn at the top is recognized as binding almost all amino acids with an average binding energy of 2.60 kJ/mol. Another (O at the top) is non-binding for most amino acids. For binding situations the average energy is 0.66 kJ/mol. The remaining two surfaces bind nearly as many amino acids as they do not and the average binding energies are 1.46 and 1.22 kJ/mol. For all of the surfaces the binding energies vary between amino acids significantly: the dispersion in the range of 68-154% of the mean. A small protein is shown to adsorb onto ZnO only intermittently and with only a small deformation. Various adsorption events lead to different patterns in mobilities of amino acids within the protein.
q-bio.BM:We calculate potentials of the mean force for twenty amino acids in the vicinity of the (111) surface of gold, for several dipeptides, and for some analogs of the side chains, using molecular dynamics simulations and the umbrella sampling method. We compare results obtained within three different force fields: one hydrophobic (for a contaminated surface) and two hydrophilic. All of these fields lead to good binding with very different specificities and different patterns in the density and polarization of water. The covalent bond with the sulfur atom on cysteine is modeled by the Morse potential. We demonstrate that binding energies of dipeptides are different than the combined binding energies of their amino-acidic components. For the hydrophobic gold, adsorption events of a small protein are driven by attraction to the strongest binding amino acids. This is not so in the hydrophilic cases - a result of smaller specificities combined with the difficulty for proteins, but not for single amino acids, to penetrate the first layer of water. The properties of water near the surface sensitively depend on the force field.
q-bio.BM:Bacteria produce a range of proteolytic enzymes, for which a number human equivalent or structurally similar examples exist and the primary focus of this study was to analyse the published literature to find proteolytic enzymes, specifically endoproteses and to examine the similarity in the substrates that they act on so as to predict a suitable structural motif which can be used as the basis for preparation of useful prodrug carriers against diseases caused by specific bacteria like Salmonella. Also, the similarities between the bacterial proteases and the action of human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), together with the MMP-like activity of bacterial endoproteases to activate human MMPs, were also analysed. This information was used to try to identify substrates on which the MMPs and bacterial proteases act, to aid the design of oligopeptide prodrug carriers to treat cancer and its metastatic spread. MMPs are greatly involved in cancer growth and progression, a few MMPs and certain proteases share a similar type of activity in degrading the extra cellular matrix (ECM) and substrates including gelatin. Our primary targets of study were to identify the proteases and MMPs that facilitate the migration of bacteria and growth of tumour cells respectively. The study was thus a two-way approach to study the substrate specificity of both bacterial proteases and MMPs, thereby to help in characterisation of their substrates. Various bioinformatics tools were used in the characterisation of the proteases and substrates as well as in the identification of possible binding sites and conserved regions in a range of candidate proteins. Central to this project was the salmonella derived PgtE surface protease that has been shown recently to act upon the pro-forms of human MMP-9.
q-bio.BM:Wolumes is a fast and stand-alone computer program written in standard C that allows the measure of atom volumes in proteins. Its algorithm is a simple discretization of the space by means of a grid of points at 0.75 Angstroms from each other and it uses a set of van der Waals radii optimized for protein atoms. By comparing the computed values with distributions derived from a non-redundant subset of the Protein Data Bank, the new methods allows to identify atoms and residues abnormally large/small. The source code is freely available, together with some examples.
q-bio.BM:We show that a mesoscale model, with a minimal number of parameters, can well describe the thermomechanical and mechanochemical behavior of homogeneous DNA at thermal equilibrium under tension and torque. We predict critical temperatures for denaturation under torque and stretch, phase diagrams for stable DNA, probe/response profiles under mechanical loads, and the density of dsDNA as a function of stretch and twist. We compare our predictions with available single molecule manipulation experiments and find strong agreement. In particular we elucidate the difference between angularly constrained and unconstrained overstretching. We propose that the smoothness of the angularly constrained overstreching transition is a consequence of the molecule being in the vicinity of criticality for a broad range of values of applied tension.
q-bio.BM:We perform extensive coarse-grained (CG) Langevin dynamics simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which possess fluctuating conformational statistics between that for excluded volume random walks and collapsed globules. Our CG model includes repulsive steric, attractive hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions between residues and is calibrated to a large collection of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer data on the inter-residue separations for 36 pairs of residues in five IDPs: $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-synuclein, the microtubule-associated protein $\tau$, and prothymosin $\alpha$. We find that our CG model is able to recapitulate the average inter-residue separations regardless of the choice of the hydrophobicity scale, which shows that our calibrated model can robustly capture the conformational dynamics of IDPs. We then employ our model to study the scaling of the radius of gyration with chemical distance in 11 known IDPs. We identify a strong correlation between the distance to the dividing line between folded proteins and IDPs in the mean charge and hydrophobicity space and the scaling exponent of the radius of gyration with chemical distance along the protein.
q-bio.BM:The biomolecules in and around a living cell -- proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates -- continuously sample myriad conformational states that are thermally accessible at physiological temperatures. Simultaneously, a given biomolecule also samples (and is sampled by) a rapidly fluctuating local environment comprised of other biopolymers, small molecules, water, ions, etc. that diffuse to within a few nanometers, leading to inter-molecular contacts that stitch together large supramolecular assemblies. Indeed, all biological systems can be viewed as dynamic networks of molecular interactions. As a complement to experimentation, molecular simulation offers a uniquely powerful approach to analyze biomolecular structure, mechanism, and dynamics; this is possible because the molecular contacts that define a complicated biomolecular system are governed by the same physical principles (forces, energetics) that characterize individual small molecules, and these simpler systems are relatively well-understood. With modern algorithms and computing capabilities, simulations are now an indispensable tool for examining biomolecular assemblies in atomic detail, from the conformational motion in an individual protein to the diffusional dynamics and inter-molecular collisions in the early stages of formation of cellular-scale assemblies such as the ribosome. This text introduces the physicochemical foundations of molecular simulations and docking, largely from the perspective of biomolecular interactions.
q-bio.BM:The determination of a 'folding core' can help to provide insight into the structure, flexibility, mobility and dynamics, and hence, ultimately, function of a protein - a central concern of structural biology. Changes in the folding core upon ligand binding are of particular interest because they may be relevant to drug-induced functional changes. Cyclophilin A is a multi-functional ligand-binding protein and a significant drug target. It acts principally as an enzyme during protein folding, but also as the primary binding partner for the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA). Here, we have used hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) NMR spectroscopy to determine the folding core of the CypA-CsA complex. We also use the rapid computational tool of rigidity analysis, implemented in FIRST, to determine a theoretical folding core of the complex. In addition we generate a theoretical folding core for the unbound protein and compare this with previously published HDX data. The FIRST method gives a good prediction of the HDX folding core, but we find that it is not yet sufficiently sensitive to predict the effects of ligand binding on CypA.
q-bio.BM:Determining the folding core of a protein yields information about its folding process and dynamics. The experimental procedures for identifying the amino acids which make up the folding core include hydrogen-deuterium exchange and $\Phi$-value analysis and can be expensive and time consuming. As such there is a desire to improve upon existing methods for determining protein folding cores theoretically. Here, we use a combined method of rigidity analysis alongside coarse-grained simulations of protein motion in order to improve folding core predictions for unbound CypA and for the CypA-CsA complex. We find that the most specific prediction of folding cores in CypA and CypA-CsA comes from the intersection of the results of static rigidity analysis, implemented in the FIRST software suite, and simulations of the propensity for flexible motion, using the FRODA tool.
q-bio.BM:The analysis of correlations of amino acid occurrences in globular proteins has led to the development of statistical tools that can identify native contacts -- portions of the chains that come to close distance in folded structural ensembles. Here we introduce a statistical coupling analysis for repeat proteins -- natural systems for which the identification of domains remains challenging. We show that the inherent translational symmetry of repeat protein sequences introduces a strong bias in the pair correlations at precisely the length scale of the repeat-unit. Equalizing for this bias reveals true co-evolutionary signals from which local native-contacts can be identified. Importantly, parameter values obtained for all other interactions are not significantly affected by the equalization. We quantify the robustness of the procedure and assign confidence levels to the interactions, identifying the minimum number of sequences needed to extract evolutionary information in several repeat protein families. The overall procedure can be used to reconstruct the interactions at long distances, identifying the characteristics of the strongest couplings in each family, and can be applied to any system that appears translationally symmetric.
q-bio.BM:Given the importance of non-coding RNAs to cellular regulatory functions and rapid growth of RNA transcripts, computational prediction of RNA tertiary structure remains highly demanded yet significantly challenging. Even for a short RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is immense; existing methods to identify native-like conformations mostly resort to random sampling of conformations to gain computational feasibility. However native conformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised due to sampling. In particular, the state-of-the-art methods have yet to deliver the desired prediction performance for RNAs of length beyond 50.   This paper presents the work to tackle a key step in the RNA tertiary structure prediction problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired tertiary structure. The research is established upon a novel graph model, called backbone k-tree, to markably constrain nucleotide interaction relationships in RNA tertiary structure. It is shown that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions from the query sequence, including the interactions in all recently revealed families. Evident by the preliminary results, the new method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the tertiary structure of the query sequence, thus providing a viable solution towards ab initio prediction of RNA tertiary structure.
q-bio.BM:After a brief review of the protein folding quantum theory and a short discussion on its experimental evidences the mechanism of glucose transport across membrane is studied from the point of quantum conformational transition. The structural variations among four kinds of conformations of the human glucose transporter GLUT1 (ligand free occluded, outward open, ligand bound occluded and inward open) are looked as the quantum transition. The comparative studies between mechanisms of uniporter (GLUT1) and symporter (XylE and GlcP) are given. The transitional rates are calculated from the fundamental theory. The monosaccharide transport kinetics is proposed. The steady state of the transporter is found and its stability is studied. The glucose (xylose) translocation rates in two directions and in different steps are compared. The mean transport time in a cycle is calculated and based on it the comparison of the transport times between GLUT1,GlcP and XylE can be drawn. The non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the transition rate and the mean transport time is predicted. It is suggested that the direct measurement of temperature dependence is a useful tool for deeply understanding the transmembrane transport mechanism.
q-bio.BM:Nanotechnology and synthetic biology currently constitute one of the most innovative, interdisciplinary fields of research, poised to radically transform society in the 21st century. This paper concerns the synthetic design of ribonucleic acid molecules, using our recent algorithm, RNAiFold, which can determine all RNA sequences whose minimum free energy secondary structure is a user-specified target structure. Using RNAiFold, we design ten cis-cleaving hammerhead ribozymes, all of which are shown to be functional by a cleavage assay. We additionally use RNAiFold to design a functional cis-cleaving hammerhead as a modular unit of a synthetic larger RNA. Analysis of kinetics on this small set of hammerheads suggests that cleavage rate of computationally designed ribozymes may be correlated with positional entropy, ensemble defect, structural flexibility/rigidity and related measures. Artificial ribozymes have been designed in the past either manually or by SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment); however, this appears to be the first purely computational design and experimental validation of novel functional ribozymes. RNAiFold is available at http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAiFold/.
q-bio.BM:Protein conformational transitions, which are essential for function, may be driven either by entropy or enthalpy when molecular systems comprising solute and solvent molecules are the focus. Revealing thermodynamic origin of a given molecular process is an important but difficult task, and general principles governing protein conformational distributions remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that when protein molecules are taken as thermodynamic systems and solvents being treated as the environment, conformational entropy is an excellent proxy for free energy and is sufficient to explain protein conformational distributions. Specifically, by defining each unique combination of side chain torsional state as a conformer, the population distribution (or free energy) on an arbitrarily given order parameter is approximately a linear function of conformational entropy. Additionally, span of various microscopic potential energy terms is observed to be highly correlated with both conformational entropy and free energy. Presently widely utilized free energy proxies, including minimum potential energy, average potential energy terms by themselves or in combination with vibrational entropy\cite, are found to correlate with free energy rather poorly. Therefore, our findings provide a fundamentally new theoretical base for development of significantly more reliable and efficient next generation computational tools, where the number of available conformers,rather than poential energy of microscopic configurations, is the central focus. We anticipate that many related research fields, including structure based drug design and discovery, protein design, docking and prediction of general intermolecular interactions involving proteins, are expected to benefit greatly.
q-bio.BM:Protein binding and function often involves conformational changes. Advanced NMR experiments indicate that these conformational changes can occur in the absence of ligand molecules (or with bound ligands), and that the ligands may 'select' protein conformations for binding (or unbinding). In this review, we argue that this conformational selection requires transition times for ligand binding and unbinding that are small compared to the dwell times of proteins in different conformations, which is plausible for small ligand molecules. Such a separation of timescales leads to a decoupling and temporal ordering of binding/unbinding events and conformational changes. We propose that conformational-selection and induced-change processes (such as induced fit) are two sides of the same coin, because the temporal ordering is reversed in binding and unbinding direction. Conformational-selection processes can be characterized by a conformational excitation that occurs prior to a binding or unbinding event, while induced-change processes exhibit a characteristic conformational relaxation that occurs after a binding or unbinding event. We discuss how the ordering of events can be determined from relaxation rates and effective on- and off-rates determined in mixing experiments, and from the conformational exchange rates measured in advanced NMR or single-molecule FRET experiments. For larger ligand molecules such as peptides, conformational changes and binding events can be intricately coupled and exhibit aspects of conformational-selection and induced-change processes in both binding and unbinding direction.
q-bio.BM:In this paper we show the existence of three dimensional rigid, and thus unfoldable, lattice conformations. The structure we found has 450+ bonds, and we provide a computer assisted proof of the existence of such structures. The existence of such rigid structures illustrates why protein folding problems are hard also in dimension three. The existence of two rigid two dimensional structures was shown earlier. This work answers question 8 in \cite{2D} in the affirmative: rigid self avoiding walks exist in three dimensional lattice configurations.
q-bio.BM:Leading Ebola subtypes exhibit a wide mortality range, here explained at the molecular level by using fractal hydropathic scaling of amino acid sequences based on protein self-organized criticality. Specific hydrophobic features in the hydrophilic mucin-like domain suffice to account for the wide mortality range. Significance statement: Ebola virus is spreading rapidly in Africa. The connection between protein amino acid sequence and mortality is identified here.
q-bio.BM:More virulent strains of influenza virus subtypes H1N1 appeared in 2007 and H3N2 in 2011. The amino acid differences from prior less virulent strains appear to be small when tabulated through sequence alignments and counting site identities and similarities. Here we show how analyzing fractal hydropathic forces responsible for globular compaction and modularity quantifies the mutational origins of increased virulence, and also analyzes receptor sites and N-linked glycan accretion.
q-bio.BM:Thermodynamic tools are well suited to connecting evolution of protein functionalities to mutations of amino acid sequences, especially for neuronal network structures. These tools enable one to quantify changes in modular structure and correlate them with corresponding changes in observable properties. Here we quantify modular rodent-primate changes in amyloid precursor protein A4 and \b{eta} amyloid fragments. These are related to changes in cortical connectivity and to the presence (absence) of plaque formation in primates (rodents). Two thermodynamic scales are used, descriptive of water/air protein unfolding (old), or fractal conformational restructuring (new). These describe complementary aspects of protein activity, at respectively higher and lower effective temperatures.
q-bio.BM:In post-transcriptional regulation, an mRNA molecule is bound by many proteins and/or miRNAs to modulate its function. To enable combinatorial gene regulation, these binding partners of an RNA must communicate with each other, exhibiting cooperativity. Even in the absence of direct physical interactions between the binding partners, such cooperativity can be mediated through RNA secondary structures, since they affect the accessibility of the binding sites. Here we propose a quantitative measure of this structure-mediated cooperativity that can be numerically calculated for an arbitrary RNA sequence. Focusing on an RNA with two binding sites, we derive a characteristic difference of free energy differences, i.e. \Delta\Delta G, as a measure of the effect of the occupancy of one binding site on the binding strength of another. We apply this measure to a large number of human and C. elegans mRNAs, and find that structure-mediated cooperativity is a generic feature. Interestingly, this cooperativity not only affects binding sites in close proximity along the sequence but also configurations in which one binding site is located in the 5'UTR and the other is located in the 3'UTR of the mRNA. Furthermore, we find that this end-to-end cooperativity is determined by the UTR sequences while the sequences of the coding regions are irrelevant.
q-bio.BM:Deoxycitidine in solution exists as two tautomers one of which is an uncanonical imino one. The latter can dominate with such derivatives as 5-methyl, 5-hydroxymethyl- and 5-formylcytosine. The imino tautomer potentially is able to form a hoosteen GC base pair. To detect such pair, it is suggested to use 1H15N NMR. Formation of GC-Hoogsteen base pair with imino tautomer of cytosine can be a reason for epigenetic effects of 5-methyl- and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.
q-bio.BM:Something about structure of the water shell of DNA and how it can help to design of novel biologically-active molecules and potential drugs with sequence-specific binding to nucleic acids.
q-bio.BM:Consider the network of all secondary structures of a given RNA sequence, where nodes are connected when the corresponding structures have base pair distance one. The expected degree of the network is the average number of neighbors, where average may be computed with respect to the either the uniform or Boltzmann probability. Here we describe the first algorithm, RNAexpNumNbors, that can compute the expected number of neighbors, or expected network degree, of an input sequence. For RNA sequences from the Rfam database, the expected degree is significantly less than the CMFE structure, defined to have minimum free energy over all structures consistent with the Rfam consensus structure. The expected degree of structural RNAs, such as purine riboswitches, paradoxically appears to be smaller than that of random RNA, yet the difference between the degree of the MFE structure and the expected degree is larger than that of random RNA. Expected degree does not seem to correlate with standard structural diversity measures of RNA, such as positional entropy, ensemble defect, etc. The program {\tt RNAexpNumNbors} is written in C, runs in cubic time and quadratic space, and is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAexpNumNbors.
q-bio.BM:Toxic fibrillar aggregates of Islet Amyloid PolyPeptide (IAPP) appear as the physical outcome of a peptidic phase-transition signaling the onset of type-2 diabetes mellitus in different mammalian species. In particular, experimentally verified mutations on the amyloidogenic segment 20-29 in humans, cats and rats are highly correlated with the molecular aggregation propensities. Through a microcanonical analysis of the aggregation of IAPP_{20-29} isoforms, we show that a minimalist one-bead hydrophobic-polar continuum model for protein interactions properly quantifies those propensities from free-energy barriers. Our results highlight the central role of sequence-dependent hydrophobic mutations on hot spots for stabilization, and so for the engineering, of such biological peptides.
q-bio.BM:Allosteric regulation at distant sites is central to many cellular processes. In particular, allosteric sites in proteins are a major target to increase the range and selectivity of new drugs, and there is a need for methods capable of identifying intra-molecular signalling pathways leading to allosteric effects. Here, we use an atomistic graph-theoretical approach that exploits Markov transients to extract such pathways and exemplify our results in an important allosteric protein, caspase-1. Firstly, we use Markov Stability community detection to perform a multiscale analysis of the structure of caspase-1 which reveals that the active conformation has a weaker, less compartmentalised large-scale structure as compared to the inactive conformation, resulting in greater intra-protein coherence and signal propagation. We also carry out a full computational point mutagenesis and identify that only a few residues are critical to such structural coherence. Secondly, we characterise explicitly the transients of random walks originating at the active site and predict the location of a known allosteric site in this protein quantifying the contribution of individual bonds to the communication pathway between the active and allosteric sites. Several of the bonds we find have been shown experimentally to be functionally critical, but we also predict a number of as yet unidentified bonds which may contribute to the pathway. Our approach offers a computationally inexpensive method for the identification of allosteric sites and communication pathways in proteins using a fully atomistic description.
q-bio.BM:{\alpha}-synuclein ({\alpha}-syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein which is considered to be one of the causes of Parkinson's disease. This protein forms amyloid fibrils when in a highly concentrated solution. The fibril formation of {\alpha}-syn is induced not only by increases in {\alpha}-syn concentration but also by macromolecular crowding. In order to investigate the coupled effect of the intrinsic disorder of {\alpha}-syn and macromolecular crowding, we construct a lattice gas model of {\alpha}-syn in contact with a crowding agent reservoir based on statistical mechanics. The main assumption is that {\alpha}-syn can be expressed as coarse-grained particles with internal states coupled with effective volume; and disordered states are modeled by larger particles with larger internal entropy than other states. Thanks to the simplicity of the model, we can exactly calculate the number of conformations of crowding agents, and this enables us to prove that the original grand canonical ensemble with a crowding agent reservoir is mathematically equivalent to a canonical ensemble without crowding agents. In this expression, the effect of macromolecular crowding is absorbed in the internal entropy of disordered states; it is clearly shown that the crowding effect reduces the internal entropy. Based on Monte Carlo simulation, we provide scenarios of crowding-induced fibril formation. We also discuss the recent controversy over the existence of helically folded tetramers of {\alpha}-syn, and suggest that macromolecular crowding is the key to resolving the controversy.
q-bio.BM:Human serum transferrin (hTf) transports ferric ions in the blood stream and inflamed mucosal surfaces with high affinity and delivers them to cells via receptor mediated endocytosis. A typical hTf is folded into two homologous lobes; each lobe is further divided into two similar sized domains. Three different crystal structures of hTf delineate large conformational changes involved in iron binding/dissociation. However, whether the release process follows the same trend at serum (~7.4) and endosomal (~5.6) pH remains unanswered. The specialized role of the two lobes and if communication between them leads to efficient and controlled release is also debated. Here, we study the dynamics of the full structure as well as the separate lobes in different closed, partially open, and open conformations under the nearly neutral pH conditions in the blood serum and the more acidic one in the endosome. The results corroborate experimental observations and underscore the distinguishing effect of pH on the dynamics of hTf. Furthermore, in a total of 2 {\mu}s molecular dynamics simulation of different forms of hTf, residue fluctuations elucidate the cross talk between the two lobes correlated by the peptide linker bridging the two lobes at serum pH, while their correlated motions is lost under endosomal conditions. At serum pH, the presence of even a single iron on either lobe leads C-lobe fluctuations to subside, making it the target for recognition by human cells or hostile bacteria seeking iron sequestration. The N-lobe, on the other hand, has a propensity to open, making iron readily available when needed at regions of serum pH. At endosomal pH, both lobes readily open, making irons available for delivery. The interplay between the relative mobility of the lobes renders efficient mechanism for the recognition and release of hTf at the cell surface, and therefore its recycling in the organism.
q-bio.BM:For more than 30 years, the only enzymatic system known to catalyze the elimination of superoxide was superoxide dismutase, SOD. SOD has been found in almost all organisms living in the presence of oxygen, including some anaerobic bacteria, supporting the notion that superoxide is a key and general component of oxidative stress. Recently, a new concept in the field of the mechanisms of cellular defense against superoxide has emerged. It was discovered that elimination of superoxide in some anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria could occur by reduction, a reaction catalyzed by a small metalloenzyme thus named superoxide reductase, SOR. Having played a major role in this discovery, we describe here how the concept of superoxide reduction emerged and how it was experimentally substantiated independently in our laboratory.
q-bio.BM:Persistent homology provides a new approach for the topological simplification of big data via measuring the life time of intrinsic topological features in a filtration process and has found its success in scientific and engineering applications. However, such a success is essentially limited to qualitative data characterization, identification and analysis (CIA). In this work, we outline a general protocol to construct objective-oriented persistent homology methods. The minimization of the objective functional leads to a Laplace-Beltrami operator which generates a multiscale representation of the initial data and offers an objective oriented filtration process. The resulting differential geometry based objective-oriented persistent homology is able to preserve desirable geometric features in the evolutionary filtration and enhances the corresponding topological persistence. The consistence between Laplace-Beltrami flow based filtration and Euclidean distance based filtration is confirmed on the Vietoris-Rips complex for a large amount of numerical tests. The convergence and reliability of the present Laplace-Beltrami flow based cubical complex filtration approach are analyzed over various spatial and temporal mesh sizes. The efficiency and robustness of the present method are verified by more than 500 fullerene molecules. It is shown that the proposed persistent homology based quantitative model offers good predictions of total curvature energies for ten types of fullerene isomers. The present work offers the first example to design objective-oriented persistent homology to enhance or preserve desirable features in the original data during the filtration process and then automatically detect or extract the corresponding topological traits from the data.
q-bio.BM:Persistent homology is a relatively new tool often used for \emph{qualitative} analysis of intrinsic topological features in images and data originated from scientific and engineering applications. In this paper, we report novel \emph{quantitative} predictions of the energy and stability of fullerene molecules, the very first attempt in employing persistent homology in this context. The ground-state structures of a series of small fullerene molecules are first investigated with the standard Vietoris-Rips complex. We decipher all the barcodes, including both short-lived local bars and long-lived global bars arising from topological invariants, and associate them with fullerene structural details. By using accumulated bar lengths, we build quantitative models to correlate local and global Betti-2 bars respectively with the heat of formation and total curvature energies of fullerenes. It is found that the heat of formation energy is related to the local hexagonal cavities of small fullerenes, while the total curvature energies of fullerene isomers are associated with their sphericities, which are measured by the lengths of their long-lived Betti-2 bars. Excellent correlation coefficients ($>0.94$) between persistent homology predictions and those of quantum or curvature analysis have been observed. A correlation matrix based filtration is introduced to further verify our findings.
q-bio.BM:In this work, we introduce persistent homology for the analysis of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps. We identify the topological fingerprint or topological signature of noise, which is widespread in cryo-EM data. For low signal to noise ratio (SNR) volumetric data, intrinsic topological features of biomolecular structures are indistinguishable from noise. To remove noise, we employ geometric flows which are found to preserve the intrinsic topological fingerprints of cryo-EM structures and diminish the topological signature of noise. In particular, persistent homology enables us to visualize the gradual separation of the topological fingerprints of cryo-EM structures from those of noise during the denoising process, which gives rise to a practical procedure for prescribing a noise threshold to extract cryo-EM structure information from noise contaminated data after certain iterations of the geometric flow equation. To further demonstrate the utility of persistent homology for cryo-EM data analysis, we consider a microtubule intermediate structure (EMD-1129). Three helix models, an alpha-tubulin monomer model, an alpha- and beta-tubulin model, and an alpha- and beta-tubulin dimer model, are constructed to fit the cryo-EM data. The least square fitting leads to similarly high correlation coefficients, which indicates that structure determination via optimization is an ill-posed inverse problem. By a comparison of the topological fingerprints of the original data and those of three models, we found that the third model is topologically favored. The present work offers persistent homology based new strategies for topological denoising and for resolving ill-posed inverse problems.
q-bio.BM:Superoxide radical (O2.-) is the univalent reduction product of molecular oxygen and belongs to the group of the so-called toxic oxygen derivatives. For years the only enzymatic system known to catalyze the elimination of superoxide was the superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyzes dismutation of superoxide radical anions to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen
q-bio.BM:Proteins are the most important biomolecules for living organisms. The understanding of protein structure, function, dynamics and transport is one of most challenging tasks in biological science. In the present work, persistent homology is, for the first time, introduced for extracting molecular topological fingerprints (MTFs) based on the persistence of molecular topological invariants. MTFs are utilized for protein characterization, identification and classification. The method of slicing is proposed to track the geometric origin of protein topological invariants. Both all-atom and coarse-grained representations of MTFs are constructed. A new cutoff-like filtration is proposed to shed light on the optimal cutoff distance in elastic network models. Based on the correlation between protein compactness, rigidity and connectivity, we propose an accumulated bar length generated from persistent topological invariants for the quantitative modeling of protein flexibility. To this end, a correlation matrix based filtration is developed. This approach gives rise to an accurate prediction of the optimal characteristic distance used in protein B-factor analysis. Finally, MTFs are employed to characterize protein topological evolution during protein folding and quantitatively predict the protein folding stability. An excellent consistence between our persistent homology prediction and molecular dynamics simulation is found. This work reveals the topology-function relationship of proteins.
q-bio.BM:The flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) is a newly proposed method for the construction of atomic rigidity functions. The FRI method analyzes protein rigidity and flexibility and is capable of predicting protein B-factors without resorting to matrix diagonalization. A fundamental assumption used in the FRI is that protein structures are uniquely determined by various internal and external interactions, while the protein functions, such as stability and flexibility, are solely determined by the structure. As such, one can predict protein flexibility without resorting to the protein interaction Hamiltonian. Consequently, bypassing the matrix diagonalization, the original FRI has a computational complexity of O(N^2). This work introduces a fast FRI (fFRI) algorithm for the flexibility analysis of large macromolecules. The proposed fFRI further reduces the computational complexity to O(N). Additionally, we propose anisotropic FRI (aFRI) algorithms for the analysis of protein collective dynamics. The aFRI algorithms admit adaptive Hessian matrices, from a completely global 3N*3N matrix to completely local 3*3 matrices. However, these local 3*3 matrices have built in much non-local correlation. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy and efficiency of FRI with some {established} approaches to flexibility analysis, namely, normal mode analysis (NMA) and Gaussian network model (GNM). The accuracy of the FRI method is tested. The FRI, particularly the fFRI, is orders of magnitude more efficient and about 10% more accurate overall than some of the most popular methods in the field. The proposed fFRI is able to predict B-factors for alpha-carbons of the HIV virus capsid (313,236 residues) in less than 30 seconds on a single processor using only one core. Finally, we demonstrate the application of FRI and aFRI to protein domain analysis.
q-bio.BM:Desulfoferrodoxin is a small protein found in sulfate-reducing bacteria that contains two independent mononuclear iron centers, one ferric and one ferrous. Expression of desulfoferrodoxin from Desulfoarculus baarsii has been reported to functionally complement a superoxide dismutase deficient Escherichia coli strain. To elucidate by which mechanism desulfoferrodoxin could substitute for superoxide dismutase in E. coli, we have purified the recombinant protein and studied its reactivity toward O-(2). Desulfoferrodoxin exhibited only a weak superoxide dismutase activity (20 units mg(-1)) that could hardly account for its antioxidant properties. UV-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies revealed that the ferrous center of desulfoferrodoxin could specifically and efficiently reduce O-(2), with a rate constant of 6-7 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). In addition, we showed that membrane and cytoplasmic E. coli protein extracts, using NADH and NADPH as electron donors, could reduce the O-(2) oxidized form of desulfoferrodoxin. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that desulfoferrodoxin behaves as a superoxide reductase enzyme and thus provide new insights into the biological mechanisms designed for protection from oxidative stresses.
q-bio.BM:Flavin reductase catalyzes the reduction of free flavins by NAD(P)H. As isolated, Escherichia coli flavin reductase does not contain any flavin prosthetic group but accommodates both the reduced pyridine nucleotide and the flavin substrate in a ternary complex prior to oxidoreduction. The reduction of riboflavin by NADPH catalyzed by flavin reductase has been studied by static and rapid kinetics absorption spectroscopies. Static absorption spectroscopy experiments revealed that, in the presence of riboflavin and reduced pyridine nucleotide, flavin reductase stabilizes, although to a small extent, a charge-transfer complex of NADP+ and reduced riboflavin. In addition, reduction of riboflavin was found to be essentially irreversible. Rapid kinetics absorption spectroscopy studies demonstrated the occurrence of two intermediates with long-wavelength absorption during the catalytic cycle. Such intermediate species exhibit spectroscopic properties similar to those of charge-transfer complexes of oxidized flavin and NAD(P)H, and reduced flavin and NAD(P)+, respectively, which have been identified as intermediates during the reaction of flavoenzymes of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family. Thus, a minimal kinetic scheme for the reaction of flavin reductase with NADPH and riboflavin can be proposed. After formation of the Michaelis complex of flavin reductase with NADPH and riboflavin, a first intermediate, identified as a charge-transfer complex of NADPH and riboflavin, is formed. It is followed by a second charge-transfer intermediate of enzyme-bound NADP+ and reduced riboflavin. The latter decays, yielding the Michaelis complex of flavin reductase with NADP+ and reduced riboflavin, which then dissociates to complete the reaction. These results support the initial hypothesis of a structural similarity between flavin reductase and the enzymes of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family and extend it at a functional level.
q-bio.BM:Iron-peroxide intermediates are central in the reaction cycle of many iron-containing biomolecules. We trapped iron(III)-(hydro)peroxo species in crystals of superoxide reductase (SOR), a nonheme mononuclear iron enzyme that scavenges superoxide radicals. X-ray diffraction data at 1.95 angstrom resolution and Raman spectra recorded in crystallo revealed iron-(hydro)peroxo intermediates with the (hydro)peroxo group bound end-on. The dynamic SOR active site promotes the formation of transient hydrogen bond networks, which presumably assist the cleavage of the iron-oxygen bond in order to release the reaction product, hydrogen peroxide.
q-bio.BM:Persistent homology has emerged as a popular technique for the topological simplification of big data, including biomolecular data. Multidimensional persistence bears considerable promise to bridge the gap between geometry and topology. However, its practical and robust construction has been a challenge. We introduce two families of multidimensional persistence, namely pseudo-multidimensional persistence and multiscale multidimensional persistence. The former is generated via the repeated applications of persistent homology filtration to high dimensional data, such as results from molecular dynamics or partial differential equations. The latter is constructed via isotropic and anisotropic scales that create new simiplicial complexes and associated topological spaces. The utility, robustness and efficiency of the proposed topological methods are demonstrated via protein folding, protein flexibility analysis, the topological denoising of cryo-electron microscopy data, and the scale dependence of nano particles. Topological transition between partial folded and unfolded proteins has been observed in multidimensional persistence. The separation between noise topological signatures and molecular topological fingerprints is achieved by the Laplace-Beltrami flow. The multiscale multidimensional persistent homology reveals relative local features in Betti-0 invariants and the relatively global characteristics of Betti-1 and Betti-2 invariants.
q-bio.BM:Allosteric communication in proteins is a central and yet unsolved problem of structural biochemistry. Previous findings, from computational biology (Ota and Agard, 2005), have proposed that heat diffuses in a protein through cognate protein allosteric pathways. This work studied heat diffusion in the well-known PDZ-2 protein, and confirmed that this protein has two cognate allosteric pathways and that heat flows preferentially through these. Also, a new property was also observed for protein structures - heat diffuses asymmetrically through the structures. The underling structure of this asymmetrical heat flow was a normal length hydrogen bond (~2.85 {\AA}) that acted as a thermal rectifier. In contrast, thermal rectification was compromised in short hydrogen bonds (~2.60 {\AA}), giving rise to symmetrical thermal diffusion. Asymmetrical heat diffusion was due, on a higher scale, to the local, structural organization of residues that, in turn, was also mediated by hydrogen bonds. This asymmetrical/symmetrical energy flow may be relevant for allosteric signal communication directionality in proteins and for the control of heat flow in materials science.
q-bio.BM:The paper presents a geometrical model for protein secondary structure analysis which uses only the positions of the $C_{\alpha}$-atoms. We construct a space curve connecting these positions by piecewise polynomial interpolation and describe the folding of the protein backbone by a succession of screw motions linking the Frenet frames at consecutive $C_{\alpha}$-positions. Using the ASTRAL subset of the SCOPe data base of protein structures, we derive thresholds for the screw parameters of secondary structure elements and demonstrate that the latter can be reliably assigned on the basis of a $C_{\alpha}$-model. For this purpose we perform a comparative study with the widely used DSSP (Define Secondary Structure of Proteins) algorithm.
q-bio.BM:Superoxide reductases (SORs) are superoxide (O2-)-detoxifying enzymes that catalyse the reduction of O2- into hydrogen peroxide. Three different classes of SOR have been reported on the basis of the presence or not of an additional N-terminal domain. They all share a similar active site, with an unusual non-heme Fe atom coordinated by four equatorial histidines and one axial cysteine residues. Crucial catalytic reaction intermediates of SOR are purported to be Fe(3+)-(hydro)peroxo species. Using resonance Raman spectroscopy, we compared the vibrational properties of the Fe3+ active site of two different classes of SOR, from Desulfoarculus baarsii and Treponema pallidum, along with their ferrocyanide and their peroxo complexes. In both species, rapid treatment with H2O2 results in the stabilization of a side-on high spin Fe(3+)-(eta(2)-OO) peroxo species. Comparison of these two peroxo species reveals significant differences in vibrational frequencies and bond strengths of the Fe-O2 (weaker) and O-O (stronger) bonds for the T. pallidum enzyme. Thus, the two peroxo adducts in these two SORs have different stabilities which are also seen to be correlated with differences in the Fe-S coordination strengths as gauged by the Fe-S vibrational frequencies. This was interpreted from structural variations in the two active sites, resulting in differences in the electron donating properties of the trans cysteine ligand. Our results suggest that the structural differences observed in the active site of different classes of SORs should be a determining factor for the rate of release of the iron-peroxo intermediate during enzymatic turnover.
q-bio.BM:Superoxide reductase SOR is a non-heme iron metalloenzyme that detoxifies superoxide radical in microorganisms. Its active site consists of an unusual non-heme Fe2+ center in a [His4 Cys1] square pyramidal pentacoordination, with the axial cysteine ligand proposed to be an essential feature in catalysis. Two NH peptide groups from isoleucine 118 and histidine 119 establish H-bondings with the sulfur ligand (Desulfoarculus baarsii SOR numbering). In order to investigate the catalytic role of these H-bonds, the isoleucine 118 residue of the SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii was mutated into alanine, aspartate or serine residues. Resonance Raman spectroscopy showed that the mutations specifically induced an increase of the strength of the Fe3+-S(Cys) and S-C$\beta$(Cys) bonds as well as a change in conformation of the cysteinyl side chain, which was associated with the alteration of the NH hydrogen bonding to the sulfur ligand. The effects of the isoleucine mutations on the reactivity of SOR with $O2\bullet$- were investigated by pulse radiolysis. These studies showed that the mutations induced a specific increase of the pKa of the first reaction intermediate, recently proposed to be an $Fe2+-O2\bullet-$ species. These data were supported by DFT calculations carried out on three models of the $Fe2+-O2\bullet-$ intermediate, with one, two or no H-bonds on the sulfur ligand. Our results demonstrated that the hydrogen bonds between the NH (peptide) and the cysteine ligand tightly control the rate of protonation of the $Fe2+-O2\bullet-$ reaction intermediate to form an Fe3+-OOH species.
q-bio.BM:The NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli, named Fre, is a monomer of 26.2 kDa that catalyzes the reduction of free flavins using NADPH or NADH as electron donor. The enzyme does not contain any prosthetic group but accommodates both the reduced pyridine nucleotide and the flavin in a ternary complex prior to oxidoreduction. The specificity of the flavin reductase for the pyridine nucleotide was studied by steady-state kinetics using a variety of NADP analogs. Both the nicotinamide ring and the adenosine part of the substrate molecule have been found to be important for binding to the polypeptide chain. However, in the case of NADPH, the 2'-phosphate group destabilized almost completely the interaction with the adenosine moiety. Moreover, NADPH and NMNH are very good substrates for the flavin reductase, and we have shown that both these molecules bind to the enzyme almost exclusively by the nicotinamide ring. This provides evidence that the flavin reductase exhibits a unique mode for recognition of the reduced pyridine nucleotide. In addition, we have shown that the flavin reductase selectively transfers the pro-R hydrogen from the C-4 position of the nicotinamide ring and is therefore classified as an A-side-specific enzyme.
q-bio.BM:The two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases belong to an emerging class of enzymes involved in oxidation reactions in a number of metabolic and biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. One component is a NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase, which provides a reduced flavin to the second component, the proper monooxygenase. There, the reduced flavin activates molecular oxygen for substrate oxidation. Here, we study the flavin reductase ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 gene product, both reported to be involved in the last step of biosynthesis of the natural antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor. For the first time we show that ActVA-ORF5 is a FMN-dependent monooxygenase that together with the help of the flavin reductase ActVB catalyzes the oxidation reaction. The mechanism of the transfer of reduced FMN between ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 has been investigated. Dissociation constant values for oxidized and reduced flavin (FMNox and FMNred) with regard to ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 have been determined. The data clearly demonstrate a thermodynamic transfer of FMNred from ActVB to ActVA-ORF5 without involving a particular interaction between the two protein components. In full agreement with these data, we propose a reaction mechanism in which FMNox binds to ActVB, where it is reduced, and the resulting FMNred moves to ActVA-ORF5, where it reacts with O2 to generate a flavinperoxide intermediate. A direct spectroscopic evidence for the formation of such species within ActVA-ORF5 is reported.
q-bio.BM:Some sulfate-reducing and microaerophilic bacteria rely on the enzyme superoxide reductase (SOR) to eliminate the toxic superoxide anion radical (O2*-). SOR catalyses the one-electron reduction of O2*- to hydrogen peroxide at a nonheme ferrous iron center. The structures of Desulfoarculus baarsii SOR (mutant E47A) alone and in complex with ferrocyanide were solved to 1.15 and 1.7 A resolution, respectively. The latter structure, the first ever reported of a complex between ferrocyanide and a protein, reveals that this organo-metallic compound entirely plugs the SOR active site, coordinating the active iron through a bent cyano bridge. The subtle structural differences between the mixed-valence and the fully reduced SOR-ferrocyanide adducts were investigated by taking advantage of the photoelectrons induced by X-rays. The results reveal that photo-reduction from Fe(III) to Fe(II) of the iron center, a very rapid process under a powerful synchrotron beam, induces an expansion of the SOR active site.
q-bio.BM:Binding of a ligand on a protein changes the flexibility of certain parts of the protein, which directly affects its function. These changes are not the same at each point, some parts become more flexible and some others become stiffer. Here, an equation is derived that gives the stiffness map for proteins. The model is based on correlations of fluctuations of pairs of points that need to be evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. The model is also cast in terms of the Gaussian Network Model and changes of stiffness upon dimerization of AKT1 are evaluated as an example.
q-bio.BM:Although, several factors have been attributed to thermostability, the stabilization strategies used by proteins are still enigmatic. Studies on recombinant xylanase which has the ubiquitous (\b{eta}/{\alpha})8 TIM (Triosephosphate isomerase) barrel fold showed that, just a single extreme N-terminus mutation (V1L) markedly enhanced the thermostability by 5 {\deg}C without loss of catalytic activity whereas another mutation, V1A at the same position decreased the stability by 2 {\deg}C. Based on computational analysis of their crystal structures including residue interaction network, we established a link between N- to C-terminal contacts and protein stability. We demonstrate that augmenting of N- to C-terminal non-covalent interactions is associated with the enhancement of protein stability. We propose that the strategy of mutations at the termini could be exploited with a view to modulate stability without compromising on enzymatic activity, or in general, protein function, in diverse folds where N- and C-termini are in close proximity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the development of therapeutics involving proteins and for designing effective protein engineering strategies.
q-bio.BM:Background. The calculation of diffusion-controlled ligand binding rates is important for understanding enzyme mechanisms as well as designing enzyme inhibitors. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of a Lagrangian particle-based method, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), to study diffusion in biomolecular systems by numerically solving the time-dependent Smoluchowski equation for continuum diffusion.   Results. The numerical method is first verified in simple systems and then applied to the calculation of ligand binding to an acetylcholinesterase monomer. Unlike previous studies, a reactive Robin boundary condition (BC), rather than the absolute absorbing (Dirichlet) boundary condition, is considered on the reactive boundaries. This new boundary condition treatment allows for the analysis of enzymes with "imperfect" reaction rates. Rates for inhibitor binding to mAChE are calculated at various ionic strengths and compared with experiment and other numerical methods. We find that imposition of the Robin BC improves agreement between calculated and experimental reaction rates.   Conclusions. Although this initial application focuses on a single monomer system, our new method provides a framework to explore broader applications of SPH in larger-scale biomolecular complexes by taking advantage of its Lagrangian particle-based nature.
q-bio.BM:In this paper, we introduce the software suite, Hermes, which provides fast, novel algorithms for RNA secondary structure kinetics. Using the fast Fourier transform to efficiently compute the Boltzmann probability that a secondary structure S of a given RNA sequence has base pair distance x [resp. y] from reference structure A [resp. B], Hermes computes the exact kinetics of folding from A to B in this coarse-grained model. In particular, Hermes computes the mean first passage time from the transition probability matrix by using matrix inversion, and also computes the equilibrium time from the rate matrix by using spectral decomposition. Due to the model granularity and the speed of Hermes, it is capable of determining secondary structure refolding kinetics for large RNA sequences, beyond the range of other methods. Comparative benchmarking of Hermes with other methods indicates that Hermes provides refolding kinetics of accuracy suitable for use in computational design of RNA, an important area of synthetic biology. Source code and documentation for Hermes are available at http://bioinformatics. bc.edu/clotelab/Hermes/.
q-bio.BM:FoF1-ATP synthases are membrane-embedded protein machines that catalyze the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. Using photoactivation-based localization microscopy (PALM) in TIR-illumination as well as structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we explore the spatial distribution and track single FoF1-ATP synthases in living E. coli cells under physiological conditions at different temperatures. For quantitative diffusion analysis by mean-squared-displacement measurements, the limited size of the observation area in the membrane with its significant membrane curvature has to be considered. Therefore, we applied a 'sliding observation window' approach (M. Renz et al., Proc. SPIE 8225, 2012) and obtained the one-dimensional diffusion coefficient of FoF1-ATP synthase diffusing on the long axis in living E. coli cells.
q-bio.BM:We study four citrate synthase homodimeric proteins within a structure-based coarse-grained model. Two of these proteins come from thermophilic bacteria, one from a cryophilic bacterium and one from a mesophilic organism; three are in the closed and two in the open conformations. Even though the proteins belong to the same fold, the model distinguishes the properties of these proteins in a way which is consistent with experiments. For instance, the thermophilic proteins are more stable thermodynamically than their mesophilic and cryophilic homologues, which we observe both in the magnitude of thermal fluctuations near the native state and in the kinetics of thermal unfolding. The level of stability correlates with the average coordination number for amino acids contacts and with the degree of structural compactness. The pattern of positional fluctuations along the sequence in the closed conformation is different than in the open conformation, including within the active site. The modes of correlated and anticorrelated movements of pairs of amino acids forming the active site are very different in the open and closed conformations. Taken together, our results show that the precise location of amino acid contacts in the native structure appears to be a critical element in explaining the similarities and differences in the thermodynamic properties, local flexibility and collective motions of the different forms of the enzyme.
q-bio.BM:Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze mechanically induced dissociation and unfolding of the protein complex CD48-2B4. This heterodimer is an indispensable component of the immunological system: 2B4 is a receptor on natural killer cells whereas CD48 is expressed on surfaces of various immune cells. So far, its mechanostability has not been assessed either experimentally or theoretically. We find that the dissociation processes strongly depend on the direction of pulling and may take place in several pathways. Interestingly, the CD48-2B4 interface can be divided into three distinct patches that act as units when resisting the pulling forces. At experimentally accessible pulling speeds, the characteristic mechanostability forces are in the range between 100 and 200 pN, depending on the pulling direction. These characteristic forces need not be associated with tensile forces involved in the act of separation of the complex because prior shear-involving unraveling within individual proteins may give rise to a higher force peak.
q-bio.BM:Protein-peptide interactions play a key role in cell functions. Their structural characterization, though challenging, is important for the discovery of new drugs. The CABS-dock web server provides an interface for modeling protein-peptide interactions using a highly efficient protocol for the flexible docking of peptides to proteins. While other docking algorithms require pre-defined localization of the binding site, CABS-dock doesn't require such knowledge. Given a protein receptor structure and a peptide sequence (and starting from random conformations and positions of the peptide), CABS-dock performs simulation search for the binding site allowing for full flexibility of the peptide and small fluctuations of the receptor backbone. This protocol was extensively tested over the largest dataset of non-redundant protein-peptide interactions available to date (including bound and unbound docking cases). For over 80% of bound and unbound data set cases, we obtained models with high or medium accuracy (sufficient for practical applications). Additionally, as optional features, CABS-dock can exclude user-selected binding modes from docking search or to increase the level of flexibility for chosen receptor fragments. CABS-dock is freely available as a web server at http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock
q-bio.BM:Structuring of DNA counterions around the double helix has been studied by the molecular dynamics method. A DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) in water solution with the alkali metal counterions Na$^{+}$, K$^{+}$, and Cs$^{+}$ has been simulated. The systems have been considered in the regimes without excess salt and with different salts (0.5 M of NaCl, KCl or CsCl) added. The results have showed that the Na$^{+}$ counterions interact with the phosphate groups directly from outside of the double helix and via water molecules at the top edge of DNA minor groove. The potassium ions are mostly localized in the grooves of the double helix, and the cesium ions penetrate deeply inside the minor groove being bonded directly to the atoms of nucleic bases. Due to the electrostatic repulsion the chlorine ions tend to be localized at large distances from the DNA polyanion, but some Cl$^{-}$ anions have been detected near atomic groups of the double helix forming electrically neutral pairs with counterions already condensed on DNA. The DNA sites, where counterions are incorporated, are characterized by local changes of double helix structure. The lifetime of Na$^{+}$ and K$^{+}$ in complex with DNA atomic groups is less than 0.5 ns, while in the case of the cesium ions it may reach several nanoseconds. In this time scale, the Cs$^{+}$ counterions form a structured system of charges in the DNA minor groove that can be considered as ionic lattice.
q-bio.BM:We analyze a model statistical description of the polypeptide chain helix-coil transition, where we take into account the specificity of its primary sequence, as quantified by the phase space volume ratio of the number of all accessible states to the number corresponding to a helical conformation. The resulting transition phase diagram is then juxtaposed with the unusual behavior of the secondary structures in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) and a number of similarities are observed, even if the protein folding is a more complex transition than the helix-coil transition. In fact, the deficit in bulky and hydrophobic amino acids observed in IDPs, translated into larger values of phase space volume, allows us to locate the region in parameter space of the helix-coil transition that would correspond to the secondary structure transformations that are intrinsic to conformational transitions in IDPs and that is characterized by a modified phase diagram when compared to globular proteins. Here, we argue how the nature of this modified phase diagram, obtained from a model of the helix-coil transition in a solvent, would illuminate the turned-out response of IDPs to the changes in the environment conditions that follow straightforwardly from the re-entrant (cold denaturation) branch in their folding phase diagram.
q-bio.BM:Persistent homology has been devised as a promising tool for the topological simplification of complex data. However, it is computationally intractable for large data sets. In this work, we introduce multiresolution persistent homology for tackling large data sets. Our basic idea is to match the resolution with the scale of interest so as to create a topological microscopy for the underlying data. We utilize flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) to access the topological connectivity of the data set and define a rigidity density for the filtration analysis. By appropriately tuning the resolution, we are able to focus the topological lens on a desirable scale. The proposed multiresolution topological analysis is validated by a hexagonal fractal image which has three distinct scales. We further demonstrate the proposed method for extracting topological fingerprints from DNA and RNA molecules. In particular, the topological persistence of a virus capsid with 240 protein monomers is successfully analyzed which would otherwise be inaccessible to the normal point cloud method and unreliable by using coarse-grained multiscale persistent homology. The proposed method has also been successfully applied to the protein domain classification, which is the first time that persistent homology is used for practical protein domain analysis, to our knowledge. The proposed multiresolution topological method has potential applications in arbitrary data sets, such as social networks, biological networks and graphs.
q-bio.BM:Bacterial vaginosis (BV) increases transmission of HIV, enhances the risk of preterm labour, and its associated malodour impacts the quality of life for many women. Clinical diagnosis primarily relies on microscopy to presumptively detect a loss of lactobacilli and acquisition of anaerobes. This diagnostic does not reflect the microbiota composition accurately as lactobacilli can assume different morphotypes, and assigning BV associated morphotypes to specific organisms is challenging. Using an untargeted metabolomics approach we identify novel biomarkers for BV in a cohort of 131 Rwandan women, and demonstrate that metabolic products in the vagina are strongly associated with bacterial diversity. Metabolites associated with high diversity and clinical BV include 2-hydroxyisovalerate and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), but not the anaerobic end-product succinate. Low diversity, and high relative abundance of lactobacilli, is characterized by lactate and amino acids. Biomarkers associated with diversity and BV are independent of pregnancy status, and were validated in a blinded replication cohort from Tanzania (n=45), in which we predicted clinical BV with 91% accuracy. Correlations between the metabolome and microbiota identified Gardnerella vaginalis as a putative producer of GHB, and we demonstrate production by this species in vitro. This work provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between the vaginal microbiota and biomarkers of vaginal health and dysbiosis.
q-bio.BM:We discuss a model of protein conformations where the conformations are combinations of short fragments from some small set. For these fragments we consider a distribution of frequencies of occurrence of pairs (sequence of amino acids, conformation), averaged over some balls in the spaces of sequences and conformations. These frequencies can be estimated due to smallness of epsilon-entropy of the set of conformations of protein fragments.   We consider statistical potentials for protein fragments which describe the mentioned frequencies of occurrence and discuss model of free energy of a protein where the free energy is equal to a sum of statistical potentials of the fragments.   We also consider contribution of contacts of fragments to the energy of protein conformation, and contribution from statistical potentials of some hierarchical set of larger protein fragments. This set of fragments is constructed using the distribution of frequencies of occurrence of short fragments.   We discuss applications of this model to problem of prediction of the native conformation of a protein from its primary structure and to description of dynamics of a protein. Modification of structural alignment taking into account statistical potentials for protein fragments is considered and application to threading procedure for proteins is discussed.
q-bio.BM:Protein side-chain packing is a critical component in obtaining the 3D coordinates of a structure and drug discovery. Single-domain protein side-chain packing has been thoroughly studied. A major challenge in generalizing these methods to protein complexes is that they, unlike monomers, often have very large treewidth, and thus algorithms such as TreePack cannot be directly applied. To address this issue, SCWRL4 treats the complex effectively as a monomer, heuristically excluding weak interactions to decrease treewidth; as a result, SCWRL4 generates poor packings on protein interfaces. To date, few side-chain packing methods exist that are specifically designed for protein complexes. In this paper, we introduce a method, iTreePack, which solves the side-chain packing problem for complexes by using a novel combination of dual decomposition and tree decomposition. In particular, iTreePack overcomes the problem of large treewidth by decomposing a protein complex into smaller subgraphs and novelly reformulating the complex side-chain packing problem as a dual relaxation problem; this allows us to solve the side-chain packing of each small subgraph separately using tree-decomposition. A projected subgradient algorithm is applied to enforcing the consistency among the side-chain packings of all the small subgraphs. Computational results demonstrate that our iTreePack program outperforms SCWRL4 on protein complexes. In particular, iTreePack places side-chain atoms much more accurately on very large complexes, which constitute a significant portion of protein-protein interactions. Moreover, the advantage of iTreePack over SCWRL4 increases with respect to the treewidth of a complex. Even for monomeric proteins, iTreePack is much more efficient than SCWRL and slightly more accurate.
q-bio.BM:Protein data bank entries obtain distinct, reproducible flexibility characteristics determined by normal mode analyses of their three dimensional coordinate files. We study the effectiveness and sensitivity of this technique by analyzing the results on one class of glycosidases: family 10 xylanases. A conserved tryptophan that appears to affect access to the active site can be in one of two conformations according to X-ray crystallographic electron density data. The two alternate orientations of this active site tryptophan lead to distinct flexibility spectra, with one orientation thwarting the oscillations seen in the other. The particular orientation of this sidechain furthermore affects the appearance of the motility of a distant, C terminal region we term the mallet. The mallet region is known to separate members of this family of enzymes into two classes.
q-bio.BM:Protein-peptide interactions play essential functional roles in living organisms and their structural characterization is a hot subject of current experimental and theoretical research. Computational modeling of the structure of protein-peptide interactions is usually divided into two stages: prediction of the binding site at a protein receptor surface, and then docking (and modeling) the peptide structure into the known binding site. This paper presents a comprehensive CABS-dock method for the simultaneous search of binding sites and flexible protein-peptide docking, available as a users friendly web server. We present example CABS-dock results obtained in the default CABS-dock mode and using its advanced options that enable the user to increase the range of flexibility for chosen receptor fragments or to exclude user-selected binding modes from docking search. Furthermore, we demonstrate a strategy to improve CABS-dock performance by assessing the quality of models with classical molecular dynamics. Finally, we discuss the promising extensions and applications of the CABS-dock method and provide a tutorial appendix for the convenient analysis and visualization of CABS-dock results. The CABS-dock web server is freely available at http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock/
q-bio.BM:We have developed an analytical, ligand-specific and scalable algorithm that detects a "signature" of the 3D binding site of a given ligand in a protein 3D structure. The said signature is a 3D motif in the form of an irregular tetrahedron whose vertices represent the backbone or side-chain centroids of the amino acid residues at the binding site that physically interact with the bound ligand atoms. The motif is determined from a set of solved training structures, all of which bind the ligand. Just as alignment of linear amino acid sequences enables one to determine consensus sequences in proteins, the present method allows the determination of three-dimensional consensus structures or "motifs" in folded proteins. Although such is accomplished by the present method not by alignment of 3D protein structures or parts thereof (e.g., alignment of ligand atoms from different structures) but by nearest-neighbor analysis of ligand atoms in protein-bound forms, the same effect, and thus the same goal, is achieved. We have applied our method to the prediction of GTP- and ATP-binding protein families, namely, the small Ras-type G-protein and ser/thr protein kinase families. Validation tests reveal that the specificity of our method is nearly 100% for both protein families, and a sensitivity of greater than 60% for the ser/thr protein kinase family and approx. 93% for the small, Ras-type G-protein family. Further tests reveal that our algorithm can distinguish effectively between GTP and GTP-like ligands, and between ATP- and ATP-like ligands. The method was applied to a set of predicted (by 123D threading) protein structures from the slime mold (D. dictyostelium) proteome, with promising results.
q-bio.BM:We describe two complementary methods to quantify the degree of burial of ligand and/or ligand binding site (LBS) in a protein-ligand complex, namely, the "cutting plane" (CP) and the "tangent sphere" (TS) methods. To construct the CP and TS, two centroids are required: the protein molecular centroid (global centroid, GC), and the LBS centroid (local centroid, LC). The CP is defined as the plane passing through the LBS centroid (LC) and normal to the line passing through the LC and the protein molecular centroid (GC). The "anterior side" of the CP is the side not containing the GC (which the "posterior" side does). The TS is defined as the sphere with center at GC and tangent to the CP at LC. The percentage of protein atoms (a.) inside the TS, and (b.) on the anterior side of the CP, are two complementary measures of ligand or LBS burial depth since the latter is directly proportional to (b.) and inversely proportional to (a.). We tested the CP and TS methods using a test set of 67 well characterized protein-ligand structures (Laskowski et al., 1996), as well as the theoretical case of an artificial protein in the form of a cubic lattice grid of points in the overall shape of a sphere and in which LBS of any depth can be specified. Results from both the CP and TS methods agree very well with data reported by Laskowski et al., and results from the theoretical case further confirm that that both methods are suitable measures of ligand or LBS burial. Prior to this study, there were no such numerical measures of LBS burial available, and hence no way to directly and objectively compare LBS depths in different proteins. LBS burial depth is an important parameter as it is usually directly related to the amount of conformational change a protein undergoes upon ligand binding, and ability to quantify it could allow meaningful comparison of protein dynamics and flexibility.
q-bio.BM:Due to increased activity in high-throughput structural genomics efforts around the globe, there has been an accumulation of experimental protein 3D structures lacking functional annotation, thus creating a need for structure-based protein function assignment methods. Computational prediction of ligand binding sites (LBS) is a well-established protein function assignment method. Here we apply the specific LBS detection algorithm we recently described (Reyes, V.M. & Sheth, V.N., 2011; Reyes, V.M., 2015a) to some 801 functionally unannotated experimental structures in the Protein Data Bank by screening for the binding sites (BS) of 6 biologically important ligands: GTP in small Ras-type G-proteins, ATP in ser/thr protein kinases, sialic acid (SIA), retinoic acid (REA), and heme-bound and unbound (free) nitric oxide (hNO, fNO). Validation of the algorithm for the GTP- and ATP-binding sites has been previously described in detail (ibid.); here, validation for the BSs of the 4 other ligands shows both good specificity and sensitivity. Of the 801 structures screened, 8 tested positive for GTP binding, 61 for ATP binding, 35 for SIA binding, 132 for REA binding, 33 for hNO binding, and 10 for fNO binding. Using the cutting plane and tangent sphere methods we described previously, (Reyes, V.M., 2015b), we also determined the depth of burial of the LBSs detected above and compared the values with those from the respective training structures, and the degree of similarity between the two values taken as a further validation of the predicted LBSs. Applying this criterion, we were able to narrow down the predicted GTP-binding proteins to 2, the ATP-binding proteins to 13, the SIA-binding proteins to 2, the REA-binding proteins to 14, the hNO-binding proteins to 4, and the fNO-binding proteins to 1. We believe this further criterion increases the confidence level of our LBS predictions.
q-bio.BM:We report a 3D structure-based method of predicting protein-protein interaction partners. It involves screening for pairs of tetrahedra representing interacting amino acids at the interface of the protein-protein complex, with one tetrahedron on each protomer. H-bonds and VDW interactions at their interface are first determined and then interacting tetrahedral motifs (one from each protomer) representing backbone or side chain centroids of the interacting amino acids, are then built. The method requires that the protein protomers be transformed first into double-centroid reduced representation (Reyes, V.M. & Sheth, V.N., 2011; Reyes, V.M., 2015a). The method is applied to a set of 801 protein structures in the PDB with unknown functions, which were screened for pairs of tetrahedral motifs characteristic of nine binary complexes, namely: (1.) RAP-Gmppnp-cRAF1 Ras-binding domain; (2.) RHOA-protein kinase PKN/PRK1 effector domain; (3.) RAC-HOGD1; (4.) RAC-P67PHOX; (5.) kinase-associated phosphatase (KAP)-phosphoCDK2; (6.) Ig Fc-protein A fragment B; (7.) Ig light chain dimers; (8.) beta catenin-HTCF-4; and (9.) IL-2 homodimers. Our search method found 33, 297, 62, 63, 120, 0, 108, 16 and 504 putative complexes, respectively. After considering the degree of interface overlap between the protomers, these numbers were significantly trimmed down to 4, 2, 1, 8, 3, 0, 1, 1 and 1, respectively. Negative and positive control experiments indicate that the screening process has acceptable specificity and sensitivity. The results were further validated by applying the CP and TS methods (Reyes, V.M., 2015b) for the quantitative determination of interface burial and inter-protomer overlap in the complex. Our method is simple, fast and scalable, and once the partner interface 3D SMs are identified, they can be used to computationally dock the two protomers together to form the complex.
q-bio.BM:The identification of low-energy conformers for a given molecule is a fundamental problem in computational chemistry and cheminformatics. We assess here a conformer search that employs a genetic algorithm for sampling the low-energy segment of the conformation space of molecules. The algorithm is designed to work with first-principles methods, facilitated by the incorporation of local optimization and blacklisting conformers to prevent repeated evaluations of very similar solutions. The aim of the search is not only to find the global minimum, but to predict all conformers within an energy window above the global minimum. The performance of the search strategy is: (i) evaluated for a reference data set extracted from a database with amino acid dipeptide conformers obtained by an extensive combined force field and first-principles search and (ii) compared to the performance of a systematic search and a random conformer generator for the example of a drug-like ligand with 43 atoms, 8 rotatable bonds and 1 cis/trans bond.
q-bio.BM:Several algorithms for RNA inverse folding have been used to design synthetic riboswitches, ribozymes and thermoswitches, whose activity has been experimentally validated. The RNAiFold software is unique among approaches for inverse folding in that (exhaustive) constraint programming is used instead of heuristic methods. For that reason, RNAiFold can generate all sequences that fold into the target structure, or determine that there is no solution. RNAiFold 2.0 is a complete overhaul of RNAiFold 1.0, rewritten from the now defunct COMET language to C++. The new code properly extends the capabilities of its predecessor by providing a user-friendly pipeline to design synthetic constructs having the functionality of given Rfam families. In addition, the new software supports amino acid constraints, even for proteins translated in different reading frames from overlapping coding sequences; moreover, structure compatibility/incompatibility constraints have been expanded. With these features, RNAiFold 2.0 allows the user to design single RNA molecules as well as hybridization complexes of two RNA molecules.   The web server, source code and linux binaries are publicly accessible at http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAiFold2.0
q-bio.BM:Existing elastic network models are typically parametrized at a given cutoff distance and often fail to properly predict the thermal fluctuation of many macromolecules that involve multiple characteristic length scales. We introduce a multiscale flexibility-rigidity index (mFRI) method to resolve this problem. The proposed mFRI utilizes two or three correlation kernels parametrized at different length scales to capture protein interactions at corresponding scales. It is about 20% more accurate than the Gaussian network model (GNM) in the B-factor prediction of a set of 364 proteins. Additionally, the present method is able to delivery accurate predictions for multiscale macromolecules that fail GNM. Finally, or a protein of $N$ residues, mFRI is of linear scaling (O(N)) in computational complexity, in contrast to the order of O(N^3) for GNM.
q-bio.BM:Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA) are non-natural oligonucleotides mimics. {\gamma}-PNA backbone are formed by standard nucleic acids nucleobases connected by a neutral N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine backbone linked by a peptide bond. In this study, we use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) to explore the properties of the supramolecular duplexes formed by these species. We show that standard Watson-Crick base pair as well as non-standard ones are formed in solution. The duplexes thus formed present marked melting transition temperatures substantially higher than their nucleic acid homologs. Moreover, the presence of a chiral group on the {\gamma}-peptidic backbone increases further more this transition temperature, leading to very stable duplexes.
q-bio.BM:In this work, we report the heat rectifying capability of a-helices. Using molecular dynamics simulations we show an increased thermal diffusivity in the C-Terminal to N-Terminal direction of propagation. The origin of this effect seems to be a function of the particular orientation of the hydrogen bonds stabilizing these a-helices. Our results may be relevant for the design of thermal rectification devices for materials science and lend support to the role of normal length hydrogen bonds in the asymmetrical energy flow in proteins.
q-bio.BM:Black cumin (Nigella sativa) is a spice having medicinal properties with pungent and bitter odour. It is used since thousands of years to treat various ailments, including cancer mainly in South Asia and Middle Eastern regions. Substantial evidence in multiple research studies emphasizes about the therapeutic importance of bioactive principles of N. sativa in cancer bioassays; however, the exact mechanism of their anti-tumour action is still to be fully comprehended. The current study makes an attempt in this direction by exploiting the advancements in the Insilico reverse screening technology. In this study, three different Insilico Reverse Screening approaches have been employed for identifying the putative molecular targets of the bioactive principles in Black cumin (thymoquinone, alpha-hederin, dithymoquinone and thymohydroquinone) relevant to its anti-tumour functionality. The identified set of putative targets is further compared with the existing set of experimentally validated targets, so as to estimate the performance of insilico platforms. Subsequently, molecular docking simulations studies were performed to elucidate the molecular interactions between the bioactive compounds & their respective identified targets. The molecular interactions of one such target identified i.e. VEGF2 along with thymoquinone depicted one H-bond formed at the catalytic site. The molecular targets identified in this study need further confirmatory tests on cancer bioassays, in order to justify the research findings from Insilico platforms. This study has brought to light the effectiveness of usage of Insilico Reverse Screening protocols to characterise the un-identified target-ome of poly pharmacological bioactive agents in spices.
q-bio.BM:A quantum model on the chemically and physically induced pluripotency in stem cells is proposed. Based on the conformational Hamiltonian and the idea of slow variables (molecular torsions) slaving fast ones the conversion from the differentiate state to pluripotent state is defined as the quantum transition between conformational states. The transitional rate is calculated and an analytical form for the rate formulas is deduced. Then the dependence of the rate on the number of torsion angles of the gene and the magnitude of the rate can be estimated by comparison with protein folding. The reaction equations of the conformational change of the pluripotency genes in chemical reprogramming are given. The characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is calculated and the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition rate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape of the coherent domain is analyzed from the rate equation. It is suggested that by decreasing the coherence degree of some pluripotency genes a more effective approach to the physically induced pluripotency can be made.
q-bio.BM:The study of correlated mutations in alignments of homologous proteins proved to be succesful not only in the prediction of their native conformation, but also in the developement of a two-body effective potential between pairs of amino acids. In the present work we extend the effective potential, introducing a many--body term based on the same theoretical framework, making use of a principle of maximum entropy. The extended potential performs better than the two--body one in predicting the energetic effect of 308 mutations in 14 proteins (including membrane proteins). The average value of the parameters of the many-body term correlates with the degree of hydrophobicity of the corresponding residues, suggesting that this term partly reflects the effect of the solvent.
q-bio.BM:Numerical methods are proposed for an advanced Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Fermi (PNPF) model for studying ion transport through biological ion channels. PNPF contains many more correlations than most models and simulations of channels, because it includes water and calculates dielectric properties consistently as outputs. This model accounts for the steric effect of ions and water molecules with different sizes and interstitial voids, the correlation effect of crowded ions with different valences, and the screening effect of polarized water molecules in an inhomogeneous aqueous electrolyte. The steric energy is shown to be comparable to the electrical energy under physiological conditions, demonstrating the crucial role of the excluded volume of particles and the voids in the natural function of channel proteins. Water is shown to play a critical role in both correlation and steric effects in the model. We extend the classical Scharfetter-Gummel (SG) method for semiconductor devices to include the steric potential for ion channels, which is a fundamental physical property not present in semiconductors. Together with a simplified matched interface and boundary (SMIB) method for treating molecular surfaces and singular charges of channel proteins, the extended SG method is shown to exhibit important features in flow simulations such as optimal convergence, efficient nonlinear iterations, and physical conservation. Two different methods --- called the SMIB and multiscale methods --- are proposed for two different types of channels, namely, the gramicidin A channel and an L-type calcium channel, depending on whether water is allowed to pass through the channel. The PNPF currents are in accord with the experimental I-V (V for applied voltages) data of the gramicidin A channel and I-C (C for bath concentrations) data of the calcium channel.
q-bio.BM:In lymphoma, mutations in genes of histone modifying proteins are frequently observed. Notably, somatic mutations in the activatory histone modification writing protein MLL2 and the repressive modification writer EZH2 are the most frequent. Gain of function mutations are typically detected in EZH2 whilst MLL2 mutations are usually observed as conferring a homozygous loss of function. The gain-of-function mutations in EZH2 provide an obvious target for the development of inhibitors with therapeutic potential. To counter the loss of functional MLL2 protein, we computationally predicted compounds that are able to modulate the reader of the corresponding modifications, BPTF, to recognize other forms of the histone H3 lysine 4, instead of the tri-methylated form normally produced by MLL2. By forming a synthetic triple-complex of a compound, the histone H3 tail and BPTF we potentially circumvent the requirement for functional MLL2 methyl-transferase through the modulation of BPTF activity. Here we show a proof-of-principle that special compounds, named variators, can reprogram selectivity of protein binding and thus create artificial regulatory pathways which can have a potential therapeutic role. A therapeutic role of BPTF variators may extend to other diseases that involve loss of MLL2 function, such as Kabuki syndrome or the aberrant functioning of H3K4 modification as observed in Huntington disease and in memory formation.
q-bio.BM:Previously reported [http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06433] reprogramming of substrate specificity of H3K4Me3 epigenetic marks reading PHD domain of BPTF protein illustrates therapeutic potential of a new class of non-inhibitor small organic compounds - variators. Here we address the question about reproducibility of rational design of variators by reprogramming of the second epigenetic marks reading domain of BPTF protein - bromodomain. Bromodomain of BPTF binds to epigenetic marks in form of acetylated lysine of histone H4 (H4K12Ac, H4K16Ac and H4K20Ac), which physicochemical properties and binding mode differs considerably from those of methylated H3K4 marks. Thus, detailed description of computational approach for reprogramming of bromodomain substrate specificity illustrates both general and target specific attributes of computer aided variators design.
q-bio.BM:DNA bending is biologically important for genome regulation and is relevant to a range of nanotechnological systems. Recent results suggest that sharp bending is much easier than implied by the widely-used worm-like chain model; many of these studies, however, remain controversial. We use a coarse-grained model, previously fitted to DNA's basic thermodynamic and mechanical properties, to explore strongly bent systems. We find that as the end-to-end distance is decreased sufficiently short duplexes undergo a transition to a state in which the bending strain is localized at a flexible kink that involves disruption of base-pairing and stacking. This kinked state, which is not well-described by the worm-like chain model, allows the duplex to more easily be sharply bent. It is not completely flexible, however, due to constraints arising from the connectivity of both DNA backbones. We also perform a detailed comparison to recent experiments on a "molecular vice" that probes highly bent DNA. Close agreement between simulations and experiments strengthens the hypothesis that localised bending via kinking occurs in the molecular vice and causes enhanced flexibility of duplex DNA. Our calculations therefore suggests that the cost of kinking implied by this experiment is consistent with the known thermodynamic and mechanical properties of DNA.
q-bio.BM:DNA cyclization is a powerful technique to gain insight into the nature of DNA bending. The worm-like chain model provides a good description of small to moderate bending fluctuations, but some experiments on strongly-bent shorter molecules suggest enhanced flexibility over and above that expected from the worm-like chain. Here, we use a coarse-grained model of DNA to investigate the thermodynamics of DNA cyclization for molecules with less than 210 base pairs. As the molecules get shorter we find increasing deviations between our computed equilibrium j-factor and the worm-like chain predictions of Shimada and Yamakawa. These deviations are due to sharp kinking, first at nicks, and only subsequently in the body of the duplex. At the shortest lengths, substantial fraying at the ends of duplex domains is the dominant method of relaxation. We also estimate the dynamic j-factor measured in recent FRET experiments. We find that the dynamic j-factor is systematically larger than its equilibrium counterpart, with the deviation larger for shorter molecules, because not all the stress present in the fully cyclized state is present in the transition state. These observations are important for the interpretation of recent experiments, as only kinking within the body of the duplex is genuinely indicative of non-worm-like chain behaviour.
q-bio.BM:Folding of Ubiquitin (Ub) is investigated at low and neutral pH at different temperatures using simulations of the coarse-grained Self-Organized-Polymer model with side chains. The calculated radius of gyration, showing dramatic variations with pH, is in excellent agreement with scattering experiments. At $T_m$ Ub folds in a two-state manner at low and neutral pH. Clustering analysis of the conformations sampled in equilibrium folding trajectories at $T_m$, with multiple transitions between the folded and unfolded states, show a network of metastable states connecting the native and unfolded states. At low and neutral pH, Ub folds with high probability through a preferred set of conformations resulting in a pH-dependent dominant folding pathway. Folding kinetics reveal that Ub assembly at low pH occurs by multiple pathways involving a combination of nucleation-collapse and diffusion collision mechanism. The mechanism by which Ub folds is dictated by the stability of the key secondary structural elements responsible for establishing long range contacts and collapse of Ub. Nucleation collapse mechanism holds if the stability of these elements are marginal, as would be the case at elevated temperatures. If the lifetimes associated with these structured microdomains are on the order of hundreds of $\mu sec$ then Ub folding follows the diffusion-collision mechanism with intermediates many of which coincide with those found in equilibrium. Folding at neutral pH is a sequential process with a populated intermediate resembling that sampled at equilibrium. The transition state structures, obtained using a $P_{fold}$ analysis, are homogeneous and globular with most of the secondary and tertiary structures being native-like. Many of our findings are not only in agreement with experiments but also provide missing details not resolvable in standard experiments.
q-bio.BM:There are several applications in computational biophysics which require the optimization of discrete interacting states; e.g., amino acid titration states, ligand oxidation states, or discrete rotamer angles. Such optimization can be very time-consuming as it scales exponentially in the number of sites to be optimized. In this paper, we describe a new polynomial-time algorithm for optimization of discrete states in macromolecular systems. This algorithm was adapted from image processing and uses techniques from discrete mathematics and graph theory to restate the optimization problem in terms of "maximum flow-minimum cut" graph analysis. The interaction energy graph, a graph in which vertices (amino acids) and edges (interactions) are weighted with their respective energies, is transformed into a flow network in which the value of the minimum cut in the network equals the minimum free energy of the protein, and the cut itself encodes the state that achieves the minimum free energy. Because of its deterministic nature and polynomial-time performance, this algorithm has the potential to allow for the ionization state of larger proteins to be discovered.
q-bio.BM:Developing an accurate scoring function is essential for successfully predicting protein structures. In this study, we developed a statistical potential function, called OPUS-Beta, for energetically evaluating beta-sheet contact pattern (the entire residue-residue beta-contacts of a protein) independent of the atomic coordinate information. The OPUS-Beta potential contains five terms, i.e., a self-packing term, a pairwise inter-strand packing term, a pairwise intra-strand packing term, a lattice term and a hydrogen-bonding term. The results show that, in recognizing the native beta-contact pattern from decoys, OPUS-Beta potential outperforms the existing methods in literature, especially in combination with a method using 2D-recursive neural networks (about 5% and 23% improvements in top-1 and top-5 selections). We expect OPUS-Beta potential to be useful in beta-sheet modeling for proteins.
q-bio.BM:Methods for patterning biomolecules on a substrate at the single molecule level have been studied as a route to sensors with single-molecular sensitivity or as a way to probe biological phenomena at the single-molecule level. However, the arrangement and orientation of single biomolecules on substrates has been less investigated. Here, we examined the arrangement and orientation of two rod-like coiled-coil proteins, cortexillin and tropomyosin, around patterned gold nanostructures. The high aspect ratio of the coiled coils made it possible to study their orientations and to pursue a strategy of protein orientation via two-point attachment. The proteins were anchored to the surfaces using thiol groups, and the number of cysteine residues in tropomyosin was varied to test how this variation affected the structure and arrangement of the surface-attached proteins. Molecular dynamics studies were used to interpret the observed positional distributions. Based on initial studies of protein attachment to gold post structures, two 31-nm-long tropomyosin molecules were aligned between the two sidewalls of a trench with a width of 68 nm. Because the approach presented in this study uses one of twenty natural amino acids, this method provides a convenient way to pattern biomolecules on substrates using standard chemistry.
q-bio.BM:The eukaryotic Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins bind to DNA ubiquitously at highly conserved domains, responsible for gene regulation and the spatial organization of DNA. To study and understand the zinc finger DNA-protein interaction, we use the extended ladder in the DNA model proposed by Zhu, Rasmussen, Balatsky \& Bishop (2007) \cite{Zhu-2007}. Considering one single spinless electron in each nucleotide $\pi$-orbital along a double DNA chain (dDNA), we find a typical pattern for the {\color{black} bottom of the occupied molecular orbital (BOMO)}, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO) along the binding sites. We specifically looked at two members of zinc finger protein family: specificity protein 1 (SP1) and early grown response 1 transcription factors (EGR1). When the valence band is filled, we find electrons in the purines along the nucleotide sequence, compatible with the electric charges of the binding amino acids in SP1 and EGR1 zinc finger.
q-bio.BM:Given an RNA sequence a, consider the network G = (V;E), where the set V of nodes consists of all secondary structures of a, and whose edge set E consists of all edges connecting two secondary structures whose base pair distance is 1. Define the network connectivity, or expected network degree, as the average number of edges incident to vertices of G. Using algebraic combinatorial methods, we prove that the asymptotic connectivity of length n homopolymer sequences is 0:473418 ? n. This raises the question of what other network properties are characteristic of the network of RNA secondary structures. Programs in Python, C and Mathematica are available at the web site http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/ RNAexpNumNbors.
q-bio.BM:Conformational entropy for atomic-level, three dimensional biomolecules is known experimentally to play an important role in protein-ligand discrimination, yet reliable computation of entropy remains a difficult problem. Here we describe the first two accurate and efficient algorithms to compute the conformational entropy for RNA secondary structures, with respect to the Turner energy model, where free energy parameters are determined from UV aborption experiments. An algorithm to compute the derivational entropy for RNA secondary structures had previously been introduced, using stochastic context free grammars (SCFGs). However, the numerical value of derivational entropy depends heavily on the chosen context free grammar and on the training set used to estimate rule probabilities. Using data from the Rfam database, we determine that both of our thermodynamic methods, which agree in numerical value, are substantially faster than the SCFG method. Thermodynamic structural entropy is much smaller than derivational entropy, and the correlation between length-normalized thermodynamic entropy and derivational entropy is moderately weak to poor. In applications, we plot the structural entropy as a function of temperature for known thermoswitches, determine that the correlation between hammerhead ribozyme cleavage activity and total free energy is improved by including an additional free energy term arising from conformational entropy, and plot the structural entropy of windows of the HIV-1 genome. Our software RNAentropy can compute structural entropy for any user-specified temperature, and supports both the Turner'99 and Turner'04 energy parameters. It follows that RNAentropy is state-of-the-art software to compute RNA secondary structure conformational entropy. The software is available at http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAentropy.
q-bio.BM:Caffeine (CAF) is one of the most widely and regularly consumed biologically active substances. We use computer simulation approach to the study of CAF activity by searching for its possible complexes with biopolymer fragments. The principal CAF target at physiologically important concentrations refers to adenosine receptors. It is a common opinion that CAF is a competitive antagonist of adenosine. At the first step to molecular level elucidation of CAF action, we have found a set of the minima of the interaction energy between CAF and the fragments of human A1 adenosine receptor. Molecular mechanics is the main method for the calculations of the energy of interactions between CAF and the biopolymer fragments. We use the Monte Carlo simulation to follow various mutual arrangements of CAF molecule near the receptor. It appears that the deepest energy minima refer to hydrogen-bond formation of CAF with amino acid residues involved in interactions with adenosine, its agonists and antagonists. The results suggest that the formation of such CAF-receptor complexes enforced by a close packing of CAF and the receptor fragments is the reason of CAF actions on nervous system. CAF can block the atomic groups of the adenosine repressors responsible for the interactions with adenosine, not necessary by the formation of H bonds with them, but simply hide these groups from the interactions with adenosine.
q-bio.BM:We used statistical thermodynamics of conformational fluctuations and the elements of algebraic graph theory together with data from 2000 protein crystal structures, and showed that folded native proteins with harmonic interactions exhibit distribution functions each of which appear to be universal across all proteins. The three universal distributions are: (i) the eigenvalue spectrum of the protein graph Laplacian, (ii) the B-factor distribution of residues, and (iii) the vibrational entropy difference per residue between the unfolded and the folded states. The three distributions, which look independent of each other at first sight, are strongly associated with the Rouse chain model of a polymer as the unfolded protein. We treat the folded protein as the strongly perturbed state of the Rouse chain. We explain the underlying factors controlling the three distributions and discuss the differences from those of randomly folded structures.
q-bio.BM:Questions in computational molecular biology generate various discrete optimization problems, such as DNA sequence alignment and RNA secondary structure prediction. However, the optimal solutions are fundamentally dependent on the parameters used in the objective functions. The goal of a parametric analysis is to elucidate such dependencies, especially as they pertain to the accuracy and robustness of the optimal solutions. Techniques from geometric combinatorics, including polytopes and their normal fans, have been used previously to give parametric analyses of simple models for DNA sequence alignment and RNA branching configurations. Here, we present a new computational framework, and proof-of-principle results, which give the first complete parametric analysis of the branching portion of the nearest neighbor thermodynamic model for secondary structure prediction for real RNA sequences.
q-bio.BM:Nonlinear effects in protein dynamics are expected to play role in function, particularly of allosteric nature, by facilitating energy transfer between vibrational modes. A recently proposed method focusing on the non-Gaussian shape of the population near equilibrium projects this information onto real space in order to identify the aminoacids relevant to function. We here apply this method to three ancestral proteins in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) family and show that the mutations that restrict functional activity during GR evolution correlate significantly with locations that are highlighted by the nonlinear contribution to the near-native configurational distribution. Our findings demonstrate that nonlinear effects are not only indispensible for understanding functionality in proteins, but they can also be harnessed into a predictive tool for functional site determination.
q-bio.BM:A modified ssDNA SELEX protocol was developed in order to evolve a randomized library of imidazole modified ssDNA sequences towards sequences that mediate the formation of gold nanoparticles from Au3+ precursor ions in aqueous solution. Active sequences bound to nanoparticles were partitioned from inactive sequences based on density via ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Colloidal gold solutions produced by the evolved pool had a distinct absorbance spectra and produced nanoparticles with a narrower distribution of sizes compared to colloidal gold solutions produced by the starting, randomized pool of imidazole modified ssDNA. Sequencing data from the evolved pool shows that conserved 5 and 6 nt motifs were shared amongst many of the isolates, which indicates that these motifs could serve as chelation sites for gold atoms or help stabilize colloidal gold solutions in a base specific manner.
q-bio.BM:Protein function and dynamics are closely related to its sequence and structure. However prediction of protein function and dynamics from its sequence and structure is still a fundamental challenge in molecular biology. Protein classification, which is typically done through measuring the similarity be- tween proteins based on protein sequence or physical information, serves as a crucial step toward the understanding of protein function and dynamics. Persistent homology is a new branch of algebraic topology that has found its success in the topological data analysis in a variety of disciplines, including molecular biology. The present work explores the potential of using persistent homology as an indepen- dent tool for protein classification. To this end, we propose a molecular topological fingerprint based support vector machine (MTF-SVM) classifier. Specifically, we construct machine learning feature vectors solely from protein topological fingerprints, which are topological invariants generated during the filtration process. To validate the present MTF-SVM approach, we consider four types of problems. First, we study protein-drug binding by using the M2 channel protein of influenza A virus. We achieve 96% accuracy in discriminating drug bound and unbound M2 channels. Additionally, we examine the use of MTF-SVM for the classification of hemoglobin molecules in their relaxed and taut forms and obtain about 80% accuracy. The identification of all alpha, all beta, and alpha-beta protein domains is carried out in our next study using 900 proteins. We have found a 85% success in this identifica- tion. Finally, we apply the present technique to 55 classification tasks of protein superfamilies over 1357 samples. An average accuracy of 82% is attained. The present study establishes computational topology as an independent and effective alternative for protein classification.
q-bio.BM:Non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous, but the discovery of new RNA gene sequences far outpaces research on their structure and functional interactions. We mine the evolutionary sequence record to derive precise information about function and structure of RNAs and RNA-protein complexes. As in protein structure prediction, we use maximum entropy global probability models of sequence co-variation to infer evolutionarily constrained nucleotide-nucleotide interactions within RNA molecules, and nucleotide-amino acid interactions in RNA-protein complexes. The predicted contacts allow all-atom blinded 3D structure prediction at good accuracy for several known RNA structures and RNA-protein complexes. For unknown structures, we predict contacts in 160 non-coding RNA families. Beyond 3D structure prediction, evolutionary couplings help identify important functional interactions, e.g., at switch points in riboswitches and at a complex nucleation site in HIV. Aided by accelerating sequence accumulation, evolutionary coupling analysis can accelerate the discovery of functional interactions and 3D structures involving RNA.
q-bio.BM:Some natural proteins display recurrent structural patterns. Despite being highly similar at the tertiary structure level, repetitions within a single repeat protein can be extremely variable at the sequence level. We propose a mathematical definition of a repeat and investigate the occurrences of these in different protein families. We found that long stretches of perfect repetitions are infrequent in individual natural proteins, even for those which are known to fold into structures of recurrent structural motifs. We found that natural repeat proteins are indeed repetitive in their families, exhibiting abundant stretches of 6 amino acids or longer that are perfect repetitions in the reference family. We provide a systematic quantification for this repetitiveness, and show that this form of repetitiveness is not exclusive of repeat proteins, but also occurs in globular domains. A by-product of this work is a fast classifier of proteins into families, which yields likelihood value about a given protein belonging to a given family.
q-bio.BM:Molecular recognition between two double stranded (ds) DNA with homologous sequences may not seem compatible with the B-DNA structure because the sequence information is hidden when it is used for joining the two strands. Nevertheless, it has to be invoked to account for various biological data. Using quantum chemistry, molecular mechanics, and hints from recent genetics experiments I show here that direct recognition between homologous dsDNA is possible through formation of short quadruplexes due to direct complementary hydrogen bonding of major groove surfaces in parallel alignment. The constraints imposed by the predicted structures of the recognition units determine the mechanism of complexation between long dsDNA. This mechanism and concomitant predictions agree with available experimental data and shed light upon the sequence effects and the possible involvement of topoisomerase II in the recognition.
q-bio.BM:Shortly after the determination of the first protein x-ray crystal structures, researchers analyzed their cores and reported packing fractions $\phi \approx 0.75$, a value that is similar to close packing equal-sized spheres. A limitation of these analyses was the use of `extended atom' models, rather than the more physically accurate `explicit hydrogen' model. The validity of using the explicit hydrogen model is proved by its ability to predict the side chain dihedral angle distributions observed in proteins. We employ the explicit hydrogen model to calculate the packing fraction of the cores of over $200$ high resolution protein structures. We find that these protein cores have $\phi \approx 0.55$, which is comparable to random close-packing of non-spherical particles. This result provides a deeper understanding of the physical basis of protein structure that will enable predictions of the effects of amino acid mutations and design of new functional proteins.
q-bio.BM:In this paper, we study the selectivity of the potassium channel KcsA by a recently developed image-charge solvation method(ICSM) combined with molecular dynamics simulations. The hybrid solvation model in the ICSM is able to demonstrate atomistically the function of the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel when potassium and sodium ions are considered and their distributions inside the filter are simulated. Our study also shows that the reaction field effect, explicitly accounted for through image charge approximation in the ICSM model, is necessary in reproducing the correct selectivity property of the potassium channels.
q-bio.BM:Modern biomedicine is challenged to predict the effects of genetic variation. Systematic functional assays of point mutants of proteins have provided valuable empirical information, but vast regions of sequence space remain unexplored. Fortunately, the mutation-selection process of natural evolution has recorded rich information in the diversity of natural protein sequences. Here, building on probabilistic models for correlated amino-acid substitutions that have been successfully applied to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins, we present a statistical approach for quantifying the contribution of residues and their interactions to protein function, using a statistical energy, the evolutionary Hamiltonian. We find that these probability models predict the experimental effects of mutations with reasonable accuracy for a number of proteins, especially where the selective pressure is similar to the evolutionary pressure on the protein, such as antibiotics.
q-bio.BM:Although significant insight has been gained into biochemical, genetic and structural features of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) at the single-enzyme level, relatively little was known of how the component complexes function together in time and space until recently. Several pioneering single-molecule studies have emerged over the last decade in particular, which have illuminated our knowledge of OXPHOS, most especially on model bacterial systems. Here, we discuss these recent findings of bacterial OXPHOS, many of which generate time-resolved information of the OXPHOS machinery with the native physiological context intact. These new investigations are transforming our knowledge of not only the molecular arrangement of OXPHOS components in live bacteria, but also of the way components dynamically interact with each other in a functional state. These new discoveries have important implications towards putative supercomplex formation in bacterial OXPHOS in particular.
q-bio.BM:The direct-coupling analysis is a powerful method for protein contact prediction, and enables us to extract "direct" correlations between distant sites that are latent in "indirect" correlations observed in a protein multiple-sequence alignment. I show that the direct correlation can be obtained by using a formulation analogous to the Ornstein-Zernike integral equation in liquid theory. This formulation intuitively illustrates how the indirect or apparent correlation arises from an infinite series of direct correlations, and provides interesting insights into protein structure prediction.
q-bio.BM:Gaussian network model(GNM) and anisotropic network model(ANM) are some of the most popular methods for the study of protein flexibility and related functions. In this work, we propose generalized GNM(gGNM) and ANM methods and show that the GNM Kirchhoff matrix can be built from the ideal low-pass filter, which is a special case of a wide class of correlation functions underpinning the linear scaling flexibility-rigidity index(FRI) method. Based on the mathematical structure of correlation functions, we propose a unified framework to construct generalized Kirchhoff matrices whose matrix inverse leads to gGNMs, whereas, the direct inverse of its diagonal elements gives rise to FRI method.With this connection,we further introduce two multiscale elastic network models, namely, multiscale GNM(mGNM) and multiscale ANM(mANM), which are able to incorporate different scales into the generalized Kirchkoff matrices or generalized Hessian matrices.We validate our new multiscale methods with extensive numerical experiments. We illustrate that gGNMs outperform the original GNM method in the B-factor prediction of a set of 364 proteins.We demonstrate that for a given correlation function, FRI and gGNM methods provide essentially identical B-factor predictions when the scale value in the correlation function is sufficiently large.More importantly,we reveal intrinsic multiscale behavior in protein structures. The proposed mGNM and mANM are able to capture this multiscale behavior and thus give rise to a significant improvement of more than 11% in B-factor predictions over the original GNM and ANM methods. We further demonstrate benefit of our mGNM in the B-factor predictions on many proteins that fail the original GNM method. We show that the present mGNM can also be used to analyze protein domain separations. Finally, we showcase the ability of our mANM for the simulation of protein collective motions.
q-bio.BM:Protein-nucleic acid complexes are important for many cellular processes including the most essential function such as transcription and translation. For many protein-nucleic acid complexes, flexibility of both macromolecules has been shown to be critical for specificity and/or function. Flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) has been proposed as an accurate and efficient approach for protein flexibility analysis. In this work, we introduce FRI for the flexibility analysis of protein-nucleic acid complexes. We demonstrate that a multiscale strategy, which incorporates multiple kernels to capture various length scales in biomolecular collective motions, is able to significantly improve the state of art in the flexibility analysis of protein-nucleic acid complexes. We take the advantage of the high accuracy and ${\cal O}(N)$ computational complexity of our multiscale FRI method to investigate the flexibility of large ribosomal subunits, which is difficult to analyze by alternative approaches. An anisotropic FRI approach, which involves localized Hessian matrices, is utilized to study the translocation dynamics in an RNA polymerase.
q-bio.BM:As protein folding is a NP-complete problem, artificial intelligence tools like neural networks and genetic algorithms are used to attempt to predict the 3D shape of an amino acids sequence. Underlying these attempts, it is supposed that this folding process is predictable. However, to the best of our knowledge, this important assumption has been neither proven, nor studied. In this paper the topological dynamic of protein folding is evaluated. It is mathematically established that protein folding in 2D hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) square lattice model is chaotic as defined by Devaney. Consequences for both structure prediction and biology are then outlined.
q-bio.BM:A disease that caused by dengue virus (DENV) has become the major health problem of the world. Nowadays, no effective treatment is available to overcome the disease due to the level of dengue virus pathogeneses. A novel treatment method such as antiviral drug is highly necessary for coping with the dengue disease. Envelope protein is one of the non-structural proteins of DENV, which engaged in the viral fusion process. The fusion process is mediated by the conformational change in the protein structure from dimer to trimer state. The previous research showed the existing cavity on the dimer structure of the envelope protein. The existing ligand could get into cavity of the envelope protein, stabilize the dimer structure or hamper the transition of dimer protein into trimer. In this fashion, the fusion process can be prevented. The aim of this research is designing the cyclic peptide with prolin-prolin bond as fusion inhibitor of DENV envelope protein through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The screening of 3,883 cyclic peptides, each of them connected by prolin-prolin bond, through molecular docking resulted in five best ligands. The pharmacological and toxicity character of these five ligands were analised in silico. The result showed that PYRRP was the best ligand. PAWRP was also chosen as the best ligand because it showed good affinity with protein cavity. Stability of ligand-protein complex was analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation. The result showed that PYRRP ligand was able to support the stability of DENV envelope protein dimer structure at 310 K and 312 K. While PAWRP ligand actively formed complex with the DENV envelope protein at 310 K compared to 312 K. Thus the PYRRP ligand has a potential to be developed as DENV fusion inhibitor.
q-bio.BM:Data curation presents a challenge to all scientific disciplines to ensure public availability and reproducibility of experimental data. Standards for data preservation and exchange are central to addressing this challenge: the Investigation-Study-Assay Tabular (ISA-Tab) project has developed a widely used template for such standards in biological research. This paper describes the application of ISA-Tab to protein titration data. Despite the importance of titration experiments for understanding protein structure, stability, and function and for testing computational approaches to protein electrostatics, no such mechanism currently exists for sharing and preserving biomolecular titration data. We have adapted the ISA-Tab template to provide a structured means of supporting experimental structural chemistry data with a particular emphasis on the calculation and measurement of pKa values. This activity has been performed as part of the broader pKa Cooperative effort, leveraging data that has been collected and curated by the Cooperative members. In this article, we present the details of this specification and its application to a broad range of pKa and electrostatics data obtained for multiple protein systems. The resulting curated data is publicly available at http://pkacoop.org.
q-bio.BM:Validation of research methodology is critical in research design. Correlation between experimental observables must be established before undertaking extensive experiments or propose mechanisms. This article shows that, observables in the popular calcium flux strength assay used in the characterization of sweetener-sweet taste receptor (STR) interaction are uncorrelated. In pursuit to find potential sweeteners and enhancers, calcium flux generated via G-protein coupling for wildtype and mutant receptors expressed on cell surface is measured to identify and localize sweetener binding sites. Results are channeled for sweetener development with direct impact on public health.   We show that flux strength is independent of EC50 and sweet potency. Sweet potency-EC50 relation is non-linear and anti-correlated. Single point mutants affecting receptor efficiency, without significant shift in EC50 have been published, indicating flux strength is independent of ligand binding. G-protein coupling step is likely observed in the assay. Thus, years have been spent generating uncorrelated data. Data from uncorrelated observables does not give meaningful results. Still, majority of research in the field, uses change in calcium flux strength to study the receptor. Methodology away from flux strength monitor is required for sweetener development, reestablish binding localization of sweeteners established by flux strength method. This article serves to remind researchers to validate methodology before plunging into long term projects. Ignoring validation test on methodology, have been a costly mistake in the field. Concepts discussed here is applicable, whenever observable in biological systems are many steps moved from the event of interest.
q-bio.BM:Despite the significant increase in computational power, molecular modeling of protein structure using classical all-atom approaches remains inefficient, at least for most of the protein targets in the focus of biomedical research. Perhaps the most successful strategy to overcome the inefficiency problem is multiscale modeling to merge all-atom and coarse-grained models. This chapter describes a well-established CABS coarse-grained protein model. The CABS (C-Alpha, C-Beta and Side chains) model assumes a 2-4 united-atom representation of amino acids, knowledge-based force field (derived from the statistical regularities seen in known protein sequences and structures) and efficient Monte Carlo sampling schemes (MC dynamics, MC replica-exchange, and combinations). A particular emphasis is given to the unique design of the CABS force-field, which is largely defined using one-dimensional structural properties of proteins, including protein secondary structure. This chapter also presents CABS-based modeling methods, including multiscale tools for de novo structure prediction, modeling of protein dynamics and prediction of protein-peptide complexes. CABS-based tools are freely available at http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/tools
q-bio.BM:Calculating solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) is a run-of-the-mill calculation in structural biology. Although there are many programs available for this calculation, there are no free-standing, open-source tools designed for easy tool-chain integration. FreeSASA is an open source C library for SASA calculations that provides both command-line and Python interfaces in addition to its C API. The library implements both Lee and Richards' and Shrake and Rupley's approximations, and is highly configurable to allow the user to control molecular parameters, accuracy and output granularity. It only depends on standard C libraries and should therefore be easy to compile and install on any platform. The source code is freely available from http://freesasa.github.io/. The library is well-documented, stable and efficient. The command-line interface can easily replace closed source legacy programs, with comparable or better accuracy and speed, and with some added functionality.
q-bio.BM:Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the universal chemical energy currency for cellular activities provided mainly by the membrane enzyme FoF1-ATP synthase in bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria. Synthesis of ATP is accompanied by subunit rotation within the enzyme. Over the past 15 years we have developed a variety of single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments to monitor catalytic action of individual bacterial enzymes in vitro. By specifically labeling rotating and static subunits within a single enzyme we were able to observe three-stepped rotation in the F1 motor, ten-stepped rotation in the Fo motor and transient elastic deformation of the connected rotor subunits. However, the spatial and temporal resolution of motor activities measured by smFRET were limited by the photophysics of the FRET fluorophores. Here we evaluate the novel FRET donor mNeonGreen as a fusion to FoF1-ATP synthase and compare it to the previously used fluorophore EGFP. Topics of this manuscript are the biochemical purification procedures and the activity measurements of the fully functional mutant enzyme.
q-bio.BM:Motivation: To assess the quality of a protein model, i.e. to estimate how close it is to its native structure, using no other information than the structure of the model has been shown to be useful for structure prediction. The state of the art method, ProQ2, is based on a machine learning approach that uses a number of features calculated from a protein model. Here, we examine if these features can be exchanged with energy terms calculated from Rosetta and if a combination of these terms can improve the quality assessment. Results: When using the full atom energy function from Rosetta in ProQRosFA the QA is on par with our previous state-of-the-art method, ProQ2. The method based on the low-resolution centroid scoring function, ProQRosCen, performs almost as well and the combination of all the three methods, ProQ2, ProQRosFA and ProQCenFA into ProQ3 show superior performance over ProQ2. Availability: ProQ3 is freely available on BitBucket at https://bitbucket.org/ElofssonLab/proq3
q-bio.BM:We study the conformational freedom of a protein made by two rigid domains connected by a flexible linker. The conformational freedom is represented as an unknown probability distribution on the space of allowed states. A new algorithm for the calculation of the Maximum Allowable Probability is proposed, which can be extended to any type of measurements. In this paper we use Pseudo Contact Shifts and Residual Dipolar Coupling. We reconstruct a single central tendency in the distribution and discuss in depth the results.
q-bio.BM:3 transmembrane and 4 transmembrane helices models are suggested for the human vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). In this study, we investigate the stability of the human 3 transmembrane/4 transmembrane VKOR models employing a coarse-grained normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the analysis of the mobility of each transmembrane domain, we suggest that the 3 transmembrane human VKOR model is more stable than the 4 transmembrane human VKOR model.
q-bio.BM:A re-refinement of 4xan, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) with carboplatin crystallised in NaBr solution, has been made (Tanley et al 2016). This follows our Response article (Tanley et al 2015) to the Critique article of Shabalin et al 2015, suggesting the need for corrections to some solute molecule interpretations of electron density in 4xan and removal of an organic moiety as a ligand to the platinum ion coordinated to His15. We note Shabalin et al (2015) model of a chlorine in that density and a close by bromine at partial occupancy to explain the shape. However, as the bromide concentration is in huge excess over chloride (by 20 fold), we think that the 4yem Shabalin et al 2015 interpretation highly unlikely, but nevertheless we still cannot offer an explanation for that shape, confirming our earlier analysis described in Tanley et al (2014). Following Shabalin et al (2015) reprocessing of the raw diffraction data for 4g4a, we also redid the diffraction data processing for 4xan to a higher resolution using EVAL (Schreurs et al 2010) concluding in favour of 1.3 Angstrom as the resolution limit and which is the basis for our revised PDB file for 4xan (5HMJ). It is very interesting that there is extra X-ray diffraction data from 1.47 to 1.30 Angstrom resolution e.g. with <I/sigma(I)> =0.39 and CC1/2 = 0.181 in the final shell (1.30 to 1.322 Angstrom). In this arXiv article we document in detail our different solvent and split occupancy side chain electron density interpretations as evidence for our statement of approach in our Response article (Tanley et al 2015). Our critical re-examination includes comparisons based on the 4xan diffraction data images reprocessing with three different software packages so as to evaluate the possibility of variations in electron density interpretations due to that. Overall our finalised model (PDB code 5HMJ) is now improved over 4xan.
q-bio.BM:Proteins change their charge state through protonation and redox reactions as well as through binding charged ligands. The free energy of these reactions are dominated by solvation and electrostatic energies and modulated by protein conformational relaxation in response to the ionization state changes. Although computational methods for calculating these interactions can provide very powerful tools for predicting protein charge states, they include several critical approximations of which users should be aware. This chapter discusses the strengths, weaknesses, and approximations of popular computational methods for predicting charge states and understanding their underlying electrostatic interactions. The goal of this chapter is to inform users about applications and potential caveats of these methods as well as outline directions for future theoretical and computational research.
q-bio.BM:Structural relationships among proteins are important in the study of their evolution as well as in drug design and development. The protein 3D structure has been shown to be effective with respect to classifying proteins. Prior work has shown that the Double Centroid Reduced Representation (DCRR) model is a useful geometric representation for protein structure with respect to visual models, reducing the quantity of modeled information for each amino acid, yet retaining the most important geometrical and chemical features of each: the centroids of the backbone and of the side-chain. DCRR has not yet been applied in the calculation of geometric structural similarity. Meanwhile, multi-dimensional indexing (MDI) of protein structure combines protein structural analysis with distance metrics to facilitate structural similarity queries and is also used for clustering protein structures into related groups. In this respect, the combination of geometric models with MDI has been shown to be effective. Prior work, notably Distance and Density based Protein Indexing (DDPIn), applies MDI to protein models based on the geometry of the CA backbone. DDPIn distance metrics are based on radial and density functions that incorporate spherical-based metrics, and the indices are built from metric tree (M-tree) structures. This work combines DCRR with DDPIn for the development of new DCRR centroid-based metrics: spherical binning distance and inter-centroid spherical distance. The use of DCRR models will provide additional significant structural information via the inclusion of side-chain centroids. Additionally, the newly developed distance metric functions combined with DCRR and M-tree indexing attempt to improve upon the performance of prior work (DDPIn), given the same data set, with respect to both individual k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search queries as well as clustering all proteins in the index.
q-bio.BM:Based on overall 3D structure, proteins may be grouped into two broad categories, namely, globular proteins (spheroproteins), and elongated or rod-shaped proteins (RSP). The former comprises a significant majority of proteins. This work concerns the second category. Unlike a spheroprotein, an RSP possesses a conspicuous axis along its longest dimension. To take advantage of this symmetry element, we decided to represent RSPs using cylindrical coordinates, (rho, theta, z), with the z-axis as the main axis, and one tip of the protein at the origin. A "tip" is one of two extreme points in the protein lying along the protein axis along its longest dimension. We first identify the two tips, T1 and T2, of the RSP using a protein graphics software, then determine their (Cartesian) coordinates, (h, k, l) and (m, n, o), respectively. Arbitrarily selecting T1 as the tip at the origin, we translate the protein by subtracting (h, k, l) from all structural coordinates. We then find the angle alpha between vector T1-T2 and the positive z-axis by computing the scalar product of vectors T1- T2 and OP where P is an arbitrary point along the positive z-axis. We typically use (0, 0, p) where p is a suitable positive number. Then we compute the cross product of the two vectors to determine the axis about which we should rotate vector T1-T2 to make it coincide with the positive z-axis. We use a matrix form of Rodrigues' formula to do the rotation. We then apply the Cartesian to cylindrical coordinate transformation equations to the system. We have applied the above transformation to 15 RSPs: 1QCE, 2JJ7, 2KPE, 3K2A, 3LHP, 2LOE, 2L3H, 2L1P, 1KSG, 1KSJ, 1KSH, 2KOL, 2KZG, 2KPF and 3MQC. We have also created a web server that can take the PDB coordinate file of an RSP and output its cylindrical coordinates. The URL of our web server will be announced publicly in due course.
q-bio.BM:We have developed a web server that implements two complementary methods to quantify the depth of ligand binding site (LBS) in protein-ligand complexes: the "secant plane" (SP) and "tangent sphere" (TS) methods. The protein molecular centroid (global centroid, GC), and the LBS centroid (local centroid, LC) are first determined. The SP is the plane passing through the LC and normal to the line passing through the LC and the GC. The "exterior side" of the SP is the side opposite GC. The TS is the sphere with center at GC and tangent to the SP at LC. The percentage of protein atoms inside the TS (TS index) and on the exterior side of the SP (SP index), are complementary measures of LBS depth. The SPi is directly proportional to LBS depth while the TSi is inversely proportional. We tested the two methods using a test set of 67 well-characterized protein-ligand structures (Laskowski, et al. 1996), as well as that of an artificial protein in the form of a grid of points in the overall shape of a sphere and in which LBS of any depth can be specified. Results from both the SP and TS methods agree well with reported data (ibid.), and results from the artificial case confirm that both methods are suitable measures of LBS depth. The web server may be used in two modes. In the "ligand mode", user inputs the protein PDB coordinates as well as those of the ligand. The "LBS mode" is the same as the former, except that the ligand coordinates are assumed to be unavailable; hence the user inputs what s/he believes to be the coordinates of the LBS amino acid residues. In both cases, the web server outputs the SP and TS indices. LBS depth is usually directly related to the amount of conformational change a protein undergoes upon ligand binding - ability to quantify it could allows meaningful comparison of protein flexibility and dynamics. The URL of our web server will be announced publicly in due course.
q-bio.BM:Protein structure representation is an important tool in structural biology. There exists different methods of representing the protein 3D structures and different biologists favor different methods based on the information they require. Currently there is no available method of protein 3D structure representation which captures enough chemical information from the protein sequence and clearly shows the intra-molecular and the inter-molecular H-bonds and VDW interactions at the same time. This project aims to reduce the 3D structure of a protein and display the reduced representation along with intermolecular and the intra- molecular H-bonds and van der Waals interactions. A reduced protein representation has a significantly lower atomicity (i.e., number of atom coordinates) than one which is in all- atom representation. In this work, we transform the protein structure from all-atom representation" (AAR) to double-centroid reduced representation (DCRR), which contains amino acid backbone (N, CA, C', O) and side chain (CB and beyond) centroid coordinates instead of atomic coordinates. Another aim of this project is to develop a visualization interface for the reduced representation. This interface is implemented in MATLAB and displays the protein in DCRR along with its inter-molecular, as well as intra-molecular, interaction. Visually, DCRR is easier to comprehend than AAR. We also developed a Web Server called the Protein DCRR Web Server wherein users can enter the PDB id or upload a modeled protein and get the DCRR of that protein. The back end to the Web Server is a database which has the reduced representation for all the x-ray crystallographic structure in the PDB.
q-bio.BM:A pharmacophore consists of the parts of the structure of the ligand that are sufficient to express the biological and pharmacological effects of the ligand. It is usually a substructure of the entire structure of the ligand. Small organic molecules called ligands or metabolites in the cell form complexes with biomolecules (usually proteins) to serve different purposes. The sites at which the ligands bind are known as ligand binding sites, which are essentially "pockets" which have complementary shapes and patterns of charge distribution with the ligands. Sometimes a pocket is induced by the ligand itself. If we study different bound conformations of ligands it is found that they share a specific three- dimensional pattern that is more or less common and is responsible for its binding and which is complementary in three-dimensional geometry and charge distribution pattern with its cognate binding site in the protein. This work studies the three dimensional structure of the consensus ligand binding site for the ligand FMN. A training set for the ligand binding sites was made and a 3D consensus binding site motif was determined for FMN. The FMN system was studied and its binding sites in its respective regulator proteins. The ability to identify ligand binding site by scanning the 3D binding site consensus motif in protein 3D structures is an important step in drug target discovery. Once a pharmacophore template is found it can also be used to design other potential molecules that can bind to it and thus serve as novel drugs.
q-bio.BM:A fundamental question in protein folding is whether the coil to globule collapse transition occurs during the initial stages of folding (burst-phase) or simultaneously with the protein folding transition. Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments disagree on whether Protein L collapse transition occurs during the burst-phase of folding. We study Protein L folding using a coarse-grained model and molecular dynamics simulations. The collapse transition in Protein L is found to be concomitant with the folding transition. In the burst-phase of folding, we find that FRET experiments overestimate radius of gyration, $R_g$, of the protein due to the application of Gaussian polymer chain end-to-end distribution to extract $R_g$ from the FRET efficiency. FRET experiments estimate $\approx$ 6\AA \ decrease in $R_g$ when the actual decrease is $\approx$ 3\AA \ on Guanidinium Chloride denaturant dilution from 7.5M to 1M, and thereby suggesting pronounced compaction in the protein dimensions in the burst-phase. The $\approx$ 3\AA \ decrease is close to the statistical uncertainties of the $R_g$ data measured from SAXS experiments, which suggest no compaction, leading to a disagreement with the FRET experiments. The transition state ensemble (TSE) structures in Protein L folding are globular and extensive in agreement with the $\Psi$-analysis experiments. The results support the hypothesis that the TSE of single domain proteins depend on protein topology, and are not stabilised by local interactions alone.
q-bio.BM:Protein allostery requires dynamical structural correlations. Physical origin of which, however, remain elusive despite intensive studies during last two decades. Based on analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories for ten proteins with different sizes and folds, we found that nonlinear backbone torsional pair (BTP) correlations, which are spatially more long-ranged and are mainly executed by loop residues, exist extensively in most analyzed proteins. Examination of torsional motion for correlated BTPs suggested that aharmonic torsional state transitions are essential for such non-linear correlations, which correspondingly occur on widely different and relatively longer time scales. In contrast, BTP correlations between backbone torsions in stable $\alpha$ helices and $\beta$ strands are mainly linear and spatially more short-ranged, and are more likely to associate with intra-well torsional dynamics. Further analysis revealed that the direct cause of non-linear contributions are heterogeneous, and in extreme cases canceling, linear correlations associated with different torsional states of participating torsions. Therefore, torsional state transitions of participating torsions for a correlated BTP are only necessary but not sufficient condition for significant non-linear contributions. These findings implicate a general search strategy for novel allosteric modulation of protein activities. Meanwhile, it was suggested that ensemble averaged correlation calculation and static contact network analysis, while insightful, are not sufficient to elucidate mechanisms underlying allosteric signal transmission in general, dynamical and time scale resolved analysis are essential.
q-bio.BM:Free energy calculation is critical in predictive tasks such as protein folding, docking and design. However, rigorous calculation of free energy change is prohibitively expensive in these practical applications. The minimum potential energy is therefore widely utilized to approximate free energy. In this study, based on analysis of extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories of a few native globular proteins, we found that change of minimum and corresponding maximum potential energy terms exhibit similar level of correlation with change of free energy. More importantly, we demonstrated that change of span (maximum - minimum) of potential energy terms, which engender negligible additional computational cost, exhibit considerably stronger correlations with change of free energy than the corresponding change of minimum and maximum potential energy terms. Therefore, potential energy span may serve as an alternative efficient approximate free energy proxy.
q-bio.BM:As an example of topic where biology and physics meet, we present the issue of protein folding and stability, and the development of thermodynamics-based bioinformatics tools that predict the stability and thermal resistance of proteins and the change of these quantities upon amino acid substitutions. These methods are based on knowledge-driven statistical potentials, derived from experimental protein structures using the inverse Boltzmann law. We also describe an application of these predictors, which contributed to the understanding of the mechanisms of aggregation of a particular protein known to cause a neuronal disease.
q-bio.BM:Summary: The development of automated servers to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins has seen much progress over the years. These servers make modeling simpler, but largely exclude users from the process. We present an Interactive Modeling Pipeline (IMPi) for homology modeling. The pipeline simplifies the modeling process and reduces the workload required by the user, while still allowing engagement from the user during every step. Default parameters are given for each step, which can either be modified or supplemented with additional external input. As such, it has been designed for users of varying levels of experience with homology modeling.   Availability and implementation: The IMPi site is free for non-commercial use and can be accessed at https://impi.rubi.ru.ac.za.

q-bio.BM:Self-assembly of proteins is a biological phenomenon which gives rise to spontaneous formation of amyloid fibrils or polymers. The starting point of this phase, called nucleation exhibits an important variability among replicated experiments.To analyse the stochastic nature of this phenomenon, one of the simplest models considers two populations of chemical components: monomers and polymerised monomers. Initially there are only monomers. There are two reactions for the polymerization of a monomer: either two monomers collide to combine into two polymerised monomers or a monomer is polymerised after the encounter of a polymerised monomer. It turns out that this simple model does not explain completely the variability observed in the experiments. This paper investigates extensions of this model to take into account other mechanisms of the polymerization process that may have impact an impact on fluctuations.The first variant consists in introducing a preliminary conformation step to take into account the biological fact that, before being polymerised, a monomer has two states, regular or misfolded. Only misfolded monomers can be polymerised so that the fluctuations of the number of misfolded monomers can be also a source of variability of the number of polymerised monomers. The second variant represents the reaction rate $\alpha$ of spontaneous formation of a polymer as of the order of $N^{-\nu}$, with $\nu$ some positive constant. First and second order results for the starting instant of nucleation are derived from these limit theorems. The proofs of the results rely on a study of a stochastic averaging principle for a model related to an Ehrenfest urn model, and also on a scaling analysis of a population model.
q-bio.BM:We present a semi-quantitative model of condensation of short nucleic acid (NA) duplexes induced by tri-valent cobalt(III) hexammine (CoHex) ions. The model is based on partitioning of bound counterion distribution around singleNA duplex into "external" and "internal" ion binding shells distinguished by the proximity to duplex helical axis. In the aggregated phase the shells overlap, which leads to significantly increased attraction of CoHex ions in these overlaps with the neighboring duplexes. The duplex aggregation free energy is decomposed into attractive and repulsive components in such a way that they can be represented by simple analytical expressions with parameters derived from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and numerical solutions of Poisson equation. The short-range interactions described by the attractive term depend on the fractions of bound ions in the overlapping shells and affinity of CoHex to the "external" shell of nearly neutralized duplex. The repulsive components of the free energy are duplex configurational entropy loss upon the aggregation and the electrostatic repulsion of the duplexes that remains after neutralization by bound CoHex ions. The estimates of the aggregation free energy are consistent with the experimental range of NA duplex condensation propensities, including the unusually poor condensation of RNA structures and subtle sequence effects upon DNA condensation. The model predicts that, in contrast to DNA, RNA duplexes may condense into tighter packed aggregates with a higher degree of duplex neutralization. The model also predicts that longer NA fragments will condense more readily than shorter ones. The ability of this model to explain experimentally observed trends in NA condensation, lends support to proposed NA condensation picture based on the multivalent "ion binding shells".
q-bio.BM:Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) of the Cys-loop superfamily are important neuroreceptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission. They are activated by the binding of a neurotransmitter, but the details of this process are still not fully understood. As a prototypical pLGIC, here we choose the insect resistance to dieldrin (RDL) receptor, involved in the resistance to insecticides, and investigate the binding of the neurotransmitter GABA to its extracellular domain at the atomistic level. We achieve this by means of $\mu$-sec funnel-metadynamics simulations, which efficiently enhance the sampling of bound and unbound states by using a funnel-shaped restraining potential to limit the exploration in the solvent. We reveal the sequence of events in the binding process, from the capture of GABA from the solvent to its pinning between the charged residues Arg111 and Glu204 in the binding pocket. We characterize the associated free energy landscapes in the wild-type RDL receptor and in two mutant forms, where the key residues Arg111 and Glu204 are mutated to Ala. Experimentally these mutations produce non-functional channels, which is reflected in the reduced ligand binding affinities, due to the loss of essential interactions. We also analyze the dynamical behaviour of the crucial loop C, whose opening allows the access of GABA to the binding site, while its closure locks the ligand into the protein. The RDL receptor shares structural and functional features with other pLGICs, hence our work outlines a valuable protocol to study the binding of ligands to pLGICs beyond conventional docking and molecular dynamics techniques.
q-bio.BM:In this work, we develop first near-complete 3D models for NTD-hXPB - the N-terminal protein domain of the human transcription factor XPB. The results are very significant as NTD-hXPB plays a critical role in the synthesis of proteins (specifically transcription) and DNA damage repair (specifically nucleotide excision repair). NTD-hXPB is directly implicated in rare diseases XP-B, XP-CS, and TTD2, whose symptoms include neurodegenerative disorders, premature aging, and decreased fertility. NTDhXPB is also linked to anti-cancer therapies. As a bi-product we derived 3D models of NTD-mXPB - homologue of NTD-hXPB in mycobacterium tuberculosis aka MTB (causative agent of most cases of tuberculosis, which surpassed HIV as #1 infectious disease killer in 2014). These could be potential target for TB therapeutics. Our ab-initio modelling protocol takes advantage of recent powerful advances (prediction of contact residues) in protein structure modeling. Our protocol also includes human in the loop, inspired by the prevailing theory that computational abilities of human minds can be powerfully harnessed in engineering/problem-solving. Using the developed models in this paper, we are able to propose significant insights into (a) the role of NTD-hXPB in the process of transcription and DNA damage repair (specifically NER), (b) the critical interactions of NTD-hXPB with another co-labourer protein p52, (c) diseases associated with NTD-hXPB, and (d) alterations in functionalities between NTD-hXPB (in human) and NTD-mXPB (in TB pathogen).
q-bio.BM:We present a new methodology for efficient and high-quality patterning of biological reagents for surface-based biological assays. The method relies on hydrodynamically confined nanoliter volumes of reagents to interact with the substrate at the micrometer-length scale. We study the interplay between diffusion, advection, and surface chemistry and present the design of a noncontact scanning microfluidic device to efficiently present reagents on surfaces. By leveraging convective flows, recirculation, and mixing of a processing liquid, this device overcomes limitations of existing biopatterning approaches, such as passive diffusion of analytes, uncontrolled wetting, and drying artifacts. We demonstrate the deposition of analytes, showing a 2- to 5-fold increase in deposition rate together with a 10-fold reduction in analyte consumption while ensuring less than 6% variation in pattern homogeneity on a standard biological substrate. In addition, we demonstrate the recirculation of a processing liquid using a microfluidic probe (MFP) in the context of a surface assay for (i) probing 12 independent areas with a single microliter of processing liquid and (ii) processing a 2 mm2 surface to create 170 antibody spots of 50 x 100 {\mu}m2 area using 1.6 {\mu}L of liquid. We observe high pattern quality, conservative usage of reagents, micrometer precision of localization and convection-enhanced fast deposition. Such a device and method may facilitate quantitative biological assays and spur the development of the next generation of protein microarrays.
q-bio.BM:A mystery about the origins of life is which molecular structures $-$ and what spontaneous processes $-$ drove the autocatalytic transition from simple chemistry to biology? Using the HP lattice model of polymer sequence spaces leads to the prediction that random sequences of hydrophobic ($H$) and polar ($P$) monomers can collapse into relatively compact structures, exposing hydrophobic surfaces, acting as primitive versions of today's protein catalysts, elongating other such HP polymers, as ribosomes would now do. Such foldamer-catalysts form an autocatalytic set, growing short chains into longer chains that have particular sequences. The system has capacity for the multimodality: ability to settle at multiple distinct quasi-stable states characterized by different groups of dominating polymers. This is a testable mechanism that we believe is relevant to the early origins of life.
q-bio.BM:The macromolecules that encode and translate information in living systems, DNA and RNA, exhibit distinctive structural asymmetries, including homochirality or mirror image asymmetry and $3' - 5'$ directionality, that are invariant across all life forms. The evolutionary advantages of these broken symmetries remain unknown. Here we utilize a very simple model of hypothetical self-replicating polymers to show that asymmetric autocatalytic polymers are more successful in self-replication compared to their symmetric counterparts in the Darwinian competition for space and common substrates. This broken-symmetry property, called asymmetric cooperativity, arises with the maximization of a replication potential, where the catalytic influence of inter-strand bonds on their left and right neighbors is unequal. Asymmetric cooperativity also leads to tentative, qualitative and simple evolution-based explanations for a number of other properties of DNA that include four nucleotide alphabet, three nucleotide codons, circular genomes, helicity, anti-parallel double-strand orientation, heteromolecular base-pairing, asymmetric base compositions, and palindromic instability, apart from the structural asymmetries mentioned above. Our model results and tentative explanations are consistent with multiple lines of experimental evidence, which include evidence for the presence of asymmetric cooperativity in DNA.
q-bio.BM:To better understand protein-solvent interaction we have analyzed a variety of physical and geometrical properties of the solvent-excluded surfaces (SESs) over a large set of soluble proteins with crystal structures. We discover that all have net negative surface charges and permanent electric dipoles. Moreover both SES area and surface charge as well as several physical and geometrical properties defined by them change with protein size via well-fitted power laws. The relevance to protein-solvent interaction of these physical and geometrical properties is supported by strong correlations between them and known hydrophobicity scales and by their large changes upon protein unfolding. The universal existence of negative surface charge and dipole, the characteristic surface geometry and power laws reveal fundamental but distinct roles of surface charge and SES in protein-solvent interaction and make it possible to describe solvation and hydrophobic effect using theories on anion solute in protic solvent. In particular the great significance of surface charge for protein-solvent interaction suggests that a change of perception may be needed since from solvation perspective folding into a native state is to optimize surface negative charge rather than to minimize the hydrophobic surface area.
q-bio.BM:Motivation: RNA thermometers (RNATs) are cis-regulatory ele- ments that change secondary structure upon temperature shift. Often involved in the regulation of heat shock, cold shock and virulence genes, RNATs constitute an interesting potential resource in synthetic biology, where engineered RNATs could prove to be useful tools in biosensors and conditional gene regulation. Results: Solving the 2-temperature inverse folding problem is critical for RNAT engineering. Here we introduce RNAiFold2T, the first Constraint Programming (CP) and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithms to solve this problem. Benchmarking tests of RNAiFold2T against existent programs (adaptive walk and genetic algorithm) inverse folding show that our software generates two orders of magnitude more solutions, thus allow- ing ample exploration of the space of solutions. Subsequently, solutions can be prioritized by computing various measures, including probability of target structure in the ensemble, melting temperature, etc. Using this strategy, we rationally designed two thermosensor internal ribosome entry site (thermo-IRES) elements, whose normalized cap-independent transla- tion efficiency is approximately 50% greater at 42?C than 30?C, when tested in reticulocyte lysates. Translation efficiency is lower than that of the wild-type IRES element, which on the other hand is fully resistant to temperature shift-up. This appears to be the first purely computational design of functional RNA thermoswitches, and certainly the first purely computational design of functional thermo-IRES elements. Availability: RNAiFold2T is publicly available as as part of the new re- lease RNAiFold3.0 at https://github.com/clotelab/RNAiFold and http: //bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAiFold, which latter has a web server as well. The software is written in C++ and uses OR-Tools CP search engine.
q-bio.BM:We propose a new topological characterization of RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots based on two topological invariants. Starting from the classic arc-representation of RNA secondary structures, we consider a model that couples both I) the topological genus of the graph and II) the number of crossing arcs of the corresponding primitive graph. We add a term proportional to these topological invariants to the standard free energy of the RNA molecule, thus obtaining a novel free energy parametrization which takes into account the abundance of topologies of RNA pseudoknots observed in RNA databases.
q-bio.BM:In structure-based models of proteins, one often assumes that folding is accomplished when all contacts are established. This assumption may frequently lead to a conceptual problem that folding takes place in a temperature region of very low thermodynamic stability, especially when the contact map used is too sparse. We consider six different structure-based models and show that allowing for a small, but model-dependent, percentage of the native contacts not being established boosts the folding temperature substantially while affecting the time scales of folding only in a minor way. We also compare other properties of the six models. We show that the choice of the description of the backbone stiffness has a substantial effect on the values of characteristic temperatures that relate both to equilibrium and kinetic properties. Models without any backbone stiffness (like the self-organized polymer) are found to perform similar to those with the stiffness, including in the studies of stretching.
q-bio.BM:Antibiotics such as the quinolones and fluoroquinolones kill bacterial pathogens ultimately through DNA damage. They target the essential type IIA topoisomerases in bacteria by stabilising the normally transient double strand break state which is created to modify the supercoiling state of the DNA. Here we discuss the development of these antibiotics and their method of action. Existing methods for DNA damage visualisation, such as the comet assay and immunofluorescence imaging can often only be analysed qualitatively and this analysis is subjective. We describe a putative single-molecule fluorescence technique for quantifying DNA damage via the total fluorescence intensity of a DNA origami tile fully saturated with an intercalating dye, along with the optical requirements for how to implement these into a light microscopy imaging system capable of single-molecule millisecond timescale imaging. This system promises significant improvements in reproducibility of the quantification of DNA damage over traditional techniques.
q-bio.BM:The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for understanding the majority of cellular processes. PPIs play important role in gene transcription regulation, cellular signaling, molecular basis of immune response and more. Moreover, a disruption of hese mechanisms is frequently postulated as a possible cause of diseases such as Alzheimer's or cancer. For many of biologically relevant cases the structure of protein-protein complexes remain unknown. Therefore computational techniques, including molecular docking, have become a valuable part of drug discovery pipelines. Unfortunately, none of the widely used protein-protein docking tools is free from serious limitations. Typically, in docking simulations the protein flexibility is either completely neglected or very limited. Additionally, some knowledge of the approximate location and/or the shape of the active site is also required. Such limitations arise mostly from the enormous number of degrees of freedom of protein-protein systems. In this paper, an efficient computational method for protein-protein docking is proposed and initially tested on a single docking case. The proposed method is based on a two-step procedure. In the first step, CABS-dock web server for protein-peptide docking is used to dock a peptide, which is the appropriate protein fragment responsible for the protein-protein interaction, to the other protein partner. During peptide docking, no knowledge about the binding site, nor the peptide structure, is used and the peptide is allowed to be fully flexible. In the second step, the docked peptide is used in the structural adjustment of protein complex partners. The proposed method allowed us to obtain a high accuracy model, therefore it provides a promising framework for further advances.
q-bio.BM:Despite considerable efforts, structural prediction of protein-peptide complexes is still a very challenging task, mainly due to two reasons: high flexibility of the peptides and transient character of their interactions with proteins. Recently we have developed an automated web server CABS-dock (http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock), which conducts flexible protein-peptide docking without any knowledge about the binding site. Our method allows for full flexibility of the peptide, whereas the flexibility of the receptor is restricted to near native conformations considering the main chain, and full flexibility of the side chains. Performance of the CABS-dock server was thoroughly tested on a benchmark of 171 test cases, both bound and unbound. Evaluation of the obtained results showed overall good performance of the method, especially that no information of the binding site was used. From unsuccessful experiments we learned that the accuracy of docking might be significantly improved, if only little information of the binding site was considered. In fact, in real-life applications user typically has access to some data indicating the location and/or structure of the binding site. In the current work, we test and demonstrate the performance of the CABS-dock server with two new features. The first one allows to utilize the knowledge about receptor residue(s) constituting the binding site, and the second one allows to enforce the desired secondary structure on the peptide structure. Based on the given example, we observe significant improvement of the docking accuracy in comparison to the default CABS-dock mode.
q-bio.BM:Protein-peptide molecular docking is a difficult modeling problem. It is even more challenging when significant conformational changes that may occur during the binding process need to be predicted. In this chapter, we demonstrate the capabilities and features of the CABS-dock server for flexible protein-peptide docking. CABS-dock allows highly efficient modeling of full peptide flexibility and significant flexibility of a protein receptor. During CABS-dock docking, the peptide folding and binding process is explicitly simulated and no information about the peptide binding site or its structure, is used. This chapter presents a successful CABS-dock use for docking a potentially therapeutic peptide to a protein target. Moreover, simulation contact maps, a new CABS-dock feature, are described and applied to the docking test case. Finally, a tutorial for running CABS-dock from the command line or command line scripts is provided. The CABS-dock web server is available from http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock/
q-bio.BM:Hemoglobin (Hgb) forms tetramers (dimerized dimers), which enhance its globular stability and may also facilitate small gas molecule transport, as shown by recent all-atom Newtonian solvated simulations. Hydropathic bioinformatic scaling reveals many wave-like features of strained Hgb structures at the coarse-grained amino acid level, while distinguishing between these features thermodynamically. Strain fields localized near hemes interfere with extended strain fields associated with dimer interfacial misfit, resulting in wave-length dependent dimer correlation function antiresonances.
q-bio.BM:Following the interest of L Messori and A Merlino 2016 Coordination Chemistry Reviews in the platinum ions coordination geometries in our PDB entries 4dd4 and 4dd6 we have extended our original analyses.
q-bio.BM:Sm proteins were discovered nearly 20 years ago as a group of small antigenic proteins ($\approx$ 90-120 residues). Since then, an extensive amount of biochemical and genetic data have illuminated the crucial roles of these proteins in forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that are used in RNA processing, e.g., spliceosomal removal of introns from pre-mRNAs. Spliceosomes are large macromolecular machines that are comparable to ribosomes in size and complexity, and are composed of uridine-rich small nuclear RNPs (U snRNPs). Various sets of seven different Sm proteins form the cores of most snRNPs. Despite their importance, very little is known about the atomic-resolution structure of snRNPs or their Sm cores. As a first step towards a high-resolution image of snRNPs and their hierarchic assembly, we have determined the crystal structures of archaeal homologs of Sm proteins, which we term Sm-like archaeal proteins (SmAPs).
q-bio.BM:This document attempts to clarify potential confusion regarding electrostatics calculations, specifically in the context of biomolecular structure and specifically as regards the units typically used to contour/visualize isopotential surfaces, potentials mapped onto molecular solvent-accessible surfaces, etc.
q-bio.BM:The model for cAMP-dependent synaptic plasticity relates the characterization of a noradrenaline-stimulated adenylyl cyclase with DNA unzipping. Specific proteins condition cAMP insertion in specific sites of the DNA structure to direct cellular and synaptic differentiation in brain tissues, also providing coding. Metabolic-dependent ATP binding of Mg2+, could control feedback by inactivating AC dependent formation of cAMP. The level of cAMP and cGMP, which could be assayed in red cells and cerebrospinal fluid, allows a clinical lab diagnostic improvement. Also, provides a relationship of best fitting to cAMP control by binding to DNA. The cAMP level allows the prediction of an inverse relationship between neurodegeneration and cancer. The latter, could be characterized by uncontrolled proliferation, whereas metabolic dominance by stress over a long period of time, may deplete cerebral cAMP.
q-bio.BM:In many virus families, tens to thousands of proteins assemble spontaneously into a capsid (protein shell) while packaging the genomic nucleic acid. This review summarizes recent advances in computational modeling of these dynamical processes. We present an overview of recent technological and algorithmic developments, which are enabling simulations to describe the large ranges of length-and time-scales relevant to assembly, under conditions more closely matched to experiments than in earlier work. We then describe two examples in which computational modeling has recently provided an important complement to experiments.
q-bio.BM:Considerable mechanistic insight has been gained into amyloid aggregation; however, a large class of non-amyloid protein aggregates are considered 'amorphous,' and in most cases little is known about their mechanisms. Amorphous aggregation of {\gamma}-crystallins in the eye lens causes a widespread disease of aging, cataract. We combined simulations and experiments to study the mechanism of aggregation of two {\gamma}D-crystallin mutants, W42R and W42Q - the former a congenital cataract mutation, and the latter a mimic of age-related oxidative damage. We found that formation of an internal disulfide was necessary and sufficient for aggregation under physiological conditions. Two-chain all-atom simulations predicted that one non-native disulfide in particular, between Cys32 and Cys41, was likely to stabilize an unfolding intermediate prone to intermolecular interactions. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis experiments confirmed the presence of this bond in the aggregates and its necessity for oxidative aggregation under physiological conditions in vitro. Mining the simulation data linked formation of this disulfide to extrusion of the N-terminal \b{eta}-hairpin and rearrangement of the native \b{eta}-sheet topology. Specific binding between the extruded hairpin and a distal \b{eta}-sheet, in an intermolecular chain reaction similar to domain swapping, is the most probable mechanism of aggregate propagation.
q-bio.BM:Alchemical theory is emerging as a promising tool in the context of molecular dynamics simulations for drug discovery projects. In this theoretical contribution, I revisit the statistical mechanics foundation of non covalent interactions in drug-receptor systems, providing a unifying treatment that encompasses the most important variants in the alchemical approaches, from the seminal Double Annihilation Method by Jorgensen and Ravimohan [W.L. Jorgensen and C. Ravimohan, J. Chem. Phys. 83,3050, 1985], to the Gilson's Double Decoupling Method [M. K. Gilson and J. A. Given and B. L. Bush and J. A. McCammon, Biophys. J. 72, 1047 1997] and the Deng and Roux alchemical theory [Y. Deng and B. Roux, J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2, 1255 2006]. Connections and differences between the various alchemical approaches are highlighted and discussed, and finally placed into the broader context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
q-bio.BM:We report that protein confinement within nanoscopic vesicular compartments corresponds to a liquid-liquid phase transition with the protein/water within vesicle lumen interacting very differently than in bulk. We show this effect leads to considerable structural changes on the proteins with evidence suggesting non-alpha helical conformations. Most importantly both aspects lead to a significant improvement on protein stability against thermal denaturation up to 95degC at neutral pH, with little or no evidence of unfolding or reduced enzymatic activity. The latter parameter does indeed exhibit an increase after thermal cycling. Our results suggest that nanoscopic confinement is a promising new avenue for the enhanced long-term storage of proteins. Moreover, our investigations have potentially important implications for the origin of life, since such compartmentalization may well have been critical for ensuring the preservation of primordial functional proteins under relatively harsh conditions, thus playing a key role in the subsequent emergence of primitive life forms.
q-bio.BM:Water molecules inside G-protein coupled receptor have recently been spotlighted in a series of crystal structures. To decipher the dynamics and functional roles of internal waters in GPCR activity, we studied A$_{\text{2A}}$ adenosine receptor using $\mu$sec-molecular dynamics simulations. Our study finds that the amount of water flux across the transmembrane (TM) domain varies depending on the receptor state, and that the water molecules of the TM channel in the active state flow three times slower than those in the inactive state. Depending on the location in solvent-protein interface as well as the receptor state, the average residence time of water in each residue varies from $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ psec to $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ nsec. Especially, water molecules, exhibiting ultraslow relaxation ($\sim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ nsec) in the active state, are found around the microswitch residues that are considered activity hotspots for GPCR function. A continuous allosteric network spanning the TM domain, arising from water-mediated contacts, is unique in the active state, underscoring the importance of slow waters in the GPCR activation.
q-bio.BM:The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits comprising the hexameric assembly of F1-ATPase share a high degree of structural identity, though low primary identity. Each subunit binds nucleotide in similar pockets, yet only $\beta$ subunits are catalytically active. Why? We re-examine their internal symmetry axes and observe interesting differences. Dividing each chain into an N-terminal head region, a C-terminal foot region, and a central torso, we observe (1) that while the foot and head regions in all chains obtain high and similar mobility, the torsos obtain different mobility profiles, with the $\beta$ subunits exhibiting a higher motility compared to the $\alpha$ subunits, a trend supported by the crystallographic B-factors. The $\beta$ subunits have greater torso mobility by having fewer distributed, nonlocal packing interactions providing a spacious and soft connectivity, and offsetting the resultant softness with local stiffness elements, including an additional $\beta$ sheet. (2) A loop near the nucleotide binding-domain of the $\beta$ subunits, absent in the $\alpha$ subunits, swings to create a large variation in the occlusion of the nucleotide binding region. (3) A combination of the softest three eigenmodes significantly reduces the RMSD between the open and closed conformations of the $\beta$ subnits. (4) Comparisons of computed and observed crystallographic B-factors suggest a suppression of a particular symmetry axis in an $\alpha$ subunit. (5) Unexpectedly, the soft intra-monomer oscillations pertain to distortions that do not create inter-monomer steric clashes in the assembly, suggesting that structural optimization of the assembly evolved at all levels of complexity.
q-bio.BM:We present the open source distributed software package Poisson-Boltzmann Analytical Method (PB-AM), a fully analytical solution to the linearized Poisson Boltzmann equation, for molecules represented as non-overlapping spherical cavities. The PB-AM software package includes the generation of outputs files appropriate for visualization using VMD, a Brownian dynamics scheme that uses periodic boundary conditions to simulate dynamics, the ability to specify docking criteria, and offers two different kinetics schemes to evaluate biomolecular association rate constants. Given that PB-AM defines mutual polarization completely and accurately, it can be refactored as a many-body expansion to explore 2- and 3-body polarization. Additionally, the software has been integrated into the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) software package to make it more accessible to a larger group of scientists, educators and students that are more familiar with the APBS framework.
q-bio.BM:Various genome evolutionary models have been proposed these last decades to predict the evolution of a DNA sequence over time, essentially described using a mutation matrix. By essence, all of these models relate the evolution of DNA sequences to the computation of the successive powers of the mutation matrix. To make this computation possible, hypotheses are assumed for the matrix, such as symmetry and time-reversibility, which are not compatible with mutation rates that have been recently obtained experimentally on genes ura3 and can1 of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this work, authors investigate systematically the possibility to relax either the symmetry or the time-reversibility hypothesis of the mutation matrix, by investigating all the possible matrices of size 2*2 and 3*3. As an application example, the experimental study on the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used in order to deduce a simple mutation matrix, and to compute the future evolution of the rate purine/pyrimidine for $ura3$ on the one hand, and of the particular behavior of cytosines and thymines compared to purines on the other hand.
q-bio.BM:DNA replication is a process which is common to all domains of life yet different replication mechanisms are seen among different organisms. The mechanism of replication on such a structure is not yet understood. With this bigger picture in mind, we have initiated the characterization involved in DNA replication.
q-bio.BM:Among all the proteins of Periplasmic C type cytochrome A (PPCA) family obtained from cytochrome C7 found in Geobacter sulfurreducens, PPCA protein can interact with Deoxycholate (DXCA), while its other homologs do not, as observed from the crystal structures. Utilizing the concept of 'structure-function relationship', an effort has been initiated towards understanding the driving force for recognition of DXCA exclusively by PPCA among its homologs. Further, a combinatorial analysis of the binding sequences (contiguous sequence of amino acid residues of binding locations) is performed to build graph-theoretic models, which show that PPCA differs from its homologues. Analysis of the results suggests that the underlying impetus of recognition of DXCA by PPCA is embedded in its primary sequence and 3D conformation.
q-bio.BM:Amyloid fibrillation is a protein self-assembly phenomenon that is intimately related to well-known human neurodegenerative diseases. During the past few decades, striking advances have been achieved in our understanding of the physical origin of this phenomenon and they constitute the contents of this review. Starting from a minimal model of amyloid fibrils, we explore systematically the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of amyloid fibrillation in both dilute and semi-dilute limits. We then incorporate further molecular mechanisms into the analyses. We also discuss the mathematical foundation of kinetic modeling based on chemical mass-action equations, the quantitative linkage with experimental measurements, as well as the procedure to perform global fitting.
q-bio.BM:Flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) has been developed as a robust, accurate and efficient method for macromolecular thermal fluctuation analysis and B-factor prediction. The performance of FRI depends on its formulations of rigidity index and flexibility index. In this work, we introduce alternative rigidity and flexibility formulations. The structure of the classic Gaussian surface is utilized to construct a new type of rigidity index, which leads to a new class of rigidity densities with the classic Gaussian surface as a special case. Additionally, we introduce a new type of flexibility index based on the domain indicator property of normalized rigidity density. These generalized FRI (gFRI) methods have been extensively validated by the B-factor predictions of 364 proteins. Significantly outperforming the classic Gaussian network model (GNM), gFRI is a new generation of methodologies for accurate, robust and efficient analysis of protein flexibility and fluctuation. Finally, gFRI based molecular surface generation and flexibility visualization are demonstrated.
q-bio.BM:Predicting the 3D structure of a macromolecule, such as a protein or an RNA molecule, is ranked top among the most difficult and attractive problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. Its importance comes from the relationship between the 3D structure and the function of a given protein or RNA. 3D structures also help to find the ligands of the protein, which are usually small molecules, a key step in drug design. Unfortunately, there is no shortcut to accurately obtain the 3D structure of a macromolecule. Many physical measurements of macromolecular 3D structures cannot scale up, due to their large labor costs and the requirements for lab conditions.   In recent years, computational methods have made huge progress due to advance in computation speed and machine learning methods. These methods only need the sequence information to predict 3D structures by employing various mathematical models and machine learning methods. The success of computational methods is highly dependent on a large database of the proteins and RNA with known structures.   However, the performance of computational methods are always expected to be improved. There are several reasons for this. First, we are facing, and will continue to face sparseness of data.Secondly, the 3D structure space is too large for our computational capability.   The two obstacles can be removed by knowledge-based methods, which combine knowledge learned from the known structures and biologists' knowledge of the folding process of protein or RNA. In the dissertation, I will present my results in building a knowledge-based method by using machine learning methods to tackle this problem. My methods include the knowledge constraints on intermediate states, which can highly reduce the solution space of a protein or RNA, in turn increasing the efficiency of the structure folding method and improving its accuracy.
q-bio.BM:Energy evaluation using fast Fourier transforms enables sampling billions of putative complex structures and hence revolutionized rigid protein-protein docking. However, in current methods efficient acceleration is achieved only in either the translational or the rotational subspace. Developing an efficient and accurate docking method that expands FFT based sampling to 5 rotational coordinates is an extensively studied but still unsolved problem. The algorithm presented here retains the accuracy of earlier methods but yields at least tenfold speedup. The improvement is due to two innovations. First, the search space is treated as the product manifold $\mathbf{SO(3)x(SO(3)\setminus S^1)}$, where $\mathbf{SO(3)}$ is the rotation group representing the space of the rotating ligand, and $\mathbf{(SO(3)\setminus S^1)}$ is the space spanned by the two Euler angles that define the orientation of the vector from the center of the fixed receptor toward the center of the ligand. This representation enables the use of efficient FFT methods developed for $\mathbf{SO(3)}$. Second, we select the centers of highly populated clusters of docked structures, rather than the lowest energy conformations, as predictions of the complex, and hence there is no need for very high accuracy in energy evaluation. Therefore it is sufficient to use a limited number of spherical basis functions in the Fourier space, which increases the efficiency of sampling while retaining the accuracy of docking results. A major advantage of the method is that, in contrast to classical approaches, increasing the number of correlation function terms is computationally inexpensive, which enables using complex energy functions for scoring.
q-bio.BM:Cellulosomes are complex multi-enzyme machineries which efficiently degrade plant cell-wall polysaccharides. The multiple domains of the cellulosome proteins are often tethered together by intrinsically disordered regions. The properties and functions of these disordered linkers are not well understood. In this work, we study endoglucanase Cel8A, which is a relevant enzymatic component of the cellulosomes of Clostridium thermocellum. We use both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations to investigate how the equilibrium conformations of the catalytic domain of Cel8A are affected by the disordered linker at its C terminus. We find that when the endoglucanase is bound to its substrate, the effective stiffness of the linker can influence the distances between groups of amino-acid residues throughout the entire enzymatic domain. In particular, variations in the linker stiffness can lead to small changes in the geometry of the active-site cleft. We suggest that such geometrical changes may, in turn, have an effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
q-bio.BM:Native extracellular matrices (ECMs), such as those of the human brain and other neural tissues, exhibit networks of molecular interactions between specific matrix proteins and other tissue components. Guided by these naturally self-assembling supramolecular systems, we have designed a matrix-derived protein chimera that contains a laminin globular-like (LG) domain fused to an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP). All-atom, classical molecular dynamics simulations of our designed laminin-elastin fusion protein reveal temperature-dependent conformational changes, in terms of secondary structure composition, solvent accessible surface area, hydrogen bonding, and surface hydration. These properties illuminate the phase behavior of this fusion protein, via the emergence of $\beta$-sheet character in physiologically-relevant temperature ranges.
q-bio.BM:A simple theory of ion permeation through a channel is presented, in which diffusion occurs according to Fick's law and drift according to Ohm's law, in the electric field determined by all the charges present. This theory accounts for permeation in the channels studied to date in a wide range of solutions. Interestingly, the theory works because the shape of the electric field is a sensitive function of experimental conditions, e.g., ion concentration. Rate constants for flux are sensitive functions of ionic concentration because the fixed charge of the channel protein is shielded by the ions in an near it. Such shielding effects are not included in traditional theories of ionic channels, or other proteins, for that matter.
q-bio.BM:Knots in proteins have been proposed to resist proteasomal degradation. Ample evidence associates proteasomal degradation with neurodegeneration. One interesting possibility is that indeed knotted conformers stall this machinery leading to toxicity. However, although the proteasome is known to unfold mechanically its substrates, at present there are no experimental methods to emulate this particular traction geometry. Here, we consider several dynamical models of the proteasome in which the complex is represented by an effective potential with an added pulling force. This force is meant to induce translocation of a protein or a polypeptide into the catalytic chamber. The force is either constant or applied periodically. The translocated proteins are modelled in a coarse-grained fashion. We do comparative analysis of several knotted globular proteins and the transiently knotted polyglutamine tracts of length 60 alone and fused in exon 1 of the huntingtin protein. Huntingtin is associated with Huntington disease, a well-known genetically-determined neurodegenerative disease. We show that the presence of a knot hinders and sometimes even jams translocation. We demonstrate that the probability to do so depends on the protein, the model of the proteasome, the magnitude of the pulling force, and the choice of the pulled terminus. In any case, the net effect would be a hindrance in the proteasomal degradation process in the cell. This would then yield toxicity \textit{via} two different mechanisms: one through toxic monomers compromising degradation and another by the formation of toxic oligomers. Our work paves the way to the mechanistic investigation of the mechanical unfolding of knotted structures by the proteasome and its relation to toxicity and disease.
q-bio.BM:The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 killed at least 50 million people. The reasons why this pandemic was so deadly remain largely unknown. However, It has been shown that the 1918 viral hemagglutinin allows to reproduce the hallmarks of the illness observed during the original pandemic. Thanks to the wealth of hemagglutinin sequences accumulated over the last decades, amino-acid substitutions that are found in the 1918-1919 sequences but rare otherwise can be identified with high confidence. Such an analysis reveals that Gly188, which is located within a key motif of the receptor binding site, is so rarely found in hemagglutinin sequences that, taken alone, it is likely to be deleterious. Monitoring this singular mutation in viral sequences may help prevent another dramatic pandemic.
q-bio.BM:Summary: Protein quality assessment is a long-standing problem in bioinformatics. For more than a decade we have developed state-of-art predictors by carefully selecting and optimising inputs to a machine learning method. The correlation has increased from 0.60 in ProQ to 0.81 in ProQ2 and 0.85 in ProQ3 mainly by adding a large set of carefully tuned descriptions of a protein. Here, we show that a substantial improvement can be obtained using exactly the same inputs as in ProQ2 or ProQ3 but replacing the support vector machine by a deep neural network. This improves the Pearson correlation to 0.90 (0.85 using ProQ2 input features).   Availability: ProQ3D is freely available both as a webserver and a stand-alone program at http://proq3.bioinfo.se/
q-bio.BM:We have performed all atom molecular dynamics simulations on the projection domain of the intrinsically disordered htau40 protein. After generating a suitable ensemble of starting conformations at high temperatures, at room temperature in an adaptive box algorithm we have generated histograms for the radius of gyration, secondary structure time series, generated model small angle x-ray scattering intensities, and model chemical shift plots for comparison to nuclear magnetic resonance data for solvated and filamentous tau. Significantly, we find that the chemical shift spectrum is more consistent with filamentous tau than full length solution based tau. We have also carried out principle component analysis and find three basics groups: compact globules, tadpoles, and extended hinging structures. To validate the adaptive box and our force field choice, we have run limited simulations in a large conventional box with varying force fields and find that our essential results are unchanged. We also performed two simulations with the TIP4P-D water model, the effects of which depended on whether the initial configuration was compact or extended.
q-bio.BM:Previous kinetic models had assumed that the reaction medium was reacting at random and without a turnover associated to thermodynamics exchanges, with a rigid active site on the enzyme. The experimental studies show that coupling factor 1 (CF1) from spinach chloroplasts has latent ATPase activity, which become expressed after heat-treatment and incubation with calcium. The sigmoidal kinetics observed on the competitive effect of glycerol on water saturating a protein, suggests that the role of the hydration shell in the catalytic mechanism of the CF1-ATPase, modify the number of water molecules associated with the conformational turnover required for active site activity. It is assume that the water associated to the hydrophilic state of the enzyme produces a fit-in of the substrate to form (ES), follow by the catalytic action with product formation (EP). This one induces the dissociation of water and increases the hydrophobic attractions between R-groups. The latter, becomes the form of the enzyme interacting with water to form the dissociated free enzyme (E) and free product (P). Glycerol dependent suppression of the water dynamics on two interacting sites configuration shows a change in the H-bond-configuration. The thermodynamics modeling requires an energy expenditure of about 4kcal/mol per each H-bond in turnover. Glycerol determined a turnover of 14 molecules of water released from the active sites to reach the inactive form of the enzyme. The entropy generated by turnover of the fit-in and -out substrate and product from the protein could be dissipated-out of the enzyme-water system itself. Coupling with the surrounding water clusters allows to recreate H-bonds. This should involve a decrease in the number of H-bonds present in the clusters. These changes in the mass action capability of the water clusters could eventually become dissipated through a cooling effect.
q-bio.BM:Summary: We introduce RBPBind, a web-based tool for the quantitative prediction of RNA-protein interactions. Given a user-specified RNA and a protein selected from a set of several common RNA-binding proteins, RBPBind computes the binding curve and effective binding constant of the reaction in question. The server also computes the probability that, at a given concentration of protein, a protein molecule will bind to any particular nucleotide along the RNA. The software for RBPBind is adapted from the Vienna RNA package, whose source code has been modified to accommodate the effects of single stranded RNA binding proteins. RBPBind thus fully incorporates the effect of RNA secondary structure on protein-RNA interactions. Availability: Our web server is available at http://bioserv.mps.ohio-state.edu/RBPBind
q-bio.BM:Bacterial mobility is powered by rotation of helical flagellar filaments driven by rotary motors. Flagellin isolated from {\it Salmonella Typhimurium} SJW1660 strain, which differs by a point mutation from the wild-type strain, assembles into straight filaments in which flagellin monomers are arranged into left-handed helix. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and osmotic stress methods, we investigated the high-resolution structure of SJW1660 flagellar filaments as well as intermolecular forces that govern their assembly into dense hexagonal bundle. The scattering data were fitted to high-resolution models, which took into account the atomic structure of the flagellin subunits. The analysis revealed the exact helical arrangement and the super-helical twist of the flagellin subunits within the filaments. Under osmotic stress the filaments formed $2D$ hexagonal bundles. Monte-Carlo simulations and continuum theories were used to analyze the scattering data from hexagonal arrays, revealing how bulk modulus, as well as how the deflection length depends on the applied osmotic stress. Scattering data from aligned flagellar bundles confirmed the predicated structure-factor scattering peak line-shape. Quantitative analysis of the measured equation of state of the bundles revealed the contributions of the electrostatic, hydration, and elastic interactions to the intermolecular interactions associated with bundling of straight semi-flexible flagellar filaments.}%1 {Insert Received for publication Date and in final form Date.
q-bio.BM:Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) govern a daunting number of physiological processes. For such proteins, molecular mechanisms governing their interactions with proteins involved in signal transduction pathways remain unclear. Using the folded, calcium-loaded calmodulin (CaM) interaction with the calcineurin regulatory IDP as a prototype for IDP-mediated signal transduction events, we uncover the interplay of IDP structure and electrostatic interactions in determining the kinetics of protein-protein association. Using an array of biophysical approaches including stopped-flow and computational simulation, we quantify the relative contributions of electrostatic interactions and conformational ensemble characteristics in determining association kinetics of calmodulin (CaM) and the calcineurin regulatory domain (CaN RD). Our chief findings are that CaM/CN RD association rates are strongly dependent on ionic strength and that observed rates are largely determined by the electrostatically-driven interaction strength between CaM and the narrow CaN RD calmodulin recognition domain. These studies highlight a molecular mechanism of controlling signal transduction kinetics that may be utilized in wide-ranging signaling cascades that involve IDPs.
q-bio.BM:The molecular mechanism of ion channel gating and substrate modulation is elusive for many voltage gated ion channels, such as eukaryotic sodium ones. The understanding of channel functions is a pressing issue in molecular biophysics and biology. Mathematical modeling, computation and analysis of membrane channel charge transport have become an emergent field and give rise to significant contributions to our understanding of ion channel gating and function. This review summarizes recent progresses and outlines remaining challenges in mathematical modeling, simulation and analysis of ion channel charge transport. One of our focuses is the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model and its generalizations. Specifically, the basic framework of the PNP system and some of its extensions, including size effects, ion-water interactions, coupling with density functional theory and relation to fluid flow models. A reduced theory, the Poisson- Boltzmann-Nernst-Planck (PBNP) model, and a differential geometry based ion transport model are also discussed. For proton channel, a multiscale and multiphysics Poisson-Boltzmann-Kohn-Sham (PBKS) model is presented. We show that all of these ion channel models can be cast into a unified variational multiscale framework with a macroscopic continuum domain of the solvent and a microscopic discrete domain of the solute. The main strategy is to construct a total energy functional of a charge transport system to encompass the polar and nonpolar free energies of solvation and chemical potential related energies. Current computational algorithms and tools for numerical simulations and results from mathematical analysis of ion channel systems are also surveyed.
q-bio.BM:A pattern Recognition of a probability distribution of amino acids is obtained for selected families of proteins. The mathematical model is derived from a theory of protein families formation which is derived from application of a Pauli's master equation method.
q-bio.BM:In this paper we propose a straightforward operational definition of variants of disordered proteins, taking the human proteome as a case study. The focus is on a distinction between mostly unstructured proteins and proteins which contain long unstructured regions accommodated in an overall folded structure. In particular we distinguish: i) Not disordered proteins (NDPs), that either have all their residues ordered or do not have disordered segments longer than 30 residues nor more than 30% of disordered residues; ii) Proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRPs), that have at least one disordered domain longer than 30 residues, but disordered in less than 30% of their residues; iii) Proteins that are intrinsically disordered (IDPs), that have both at least one disordered segment longer than 30 residues and that are disordered on more than 30% of their residues; iv) Proteins with fragmented disorder (FRAG_IDPs), that do not have a disordered fragment longer than 30 residues but that, nevertheless, have at least 30% or more of their residues predicted as disordered. The potential use of these variants is checked over several groups of disease-related proteins. Our main conclusions point out that IDRPs are more similar to NDPs than to IDPs. IDRPs and NDPs have a similar functional repertoire and probably share a lock-and-key mechanism of interaction with substrates. IDRPs and IDPs are differently present among human disease-related proteins. IDRPs probably do not play a specific role in the development of complex diseases, since their frequency is similar in disease-related proteins and in the entire human proteome. IDPs can play a role in the emergence of cancer, neurodegenerative, thyroid and liver disease.
q-bio.BM:Characterization of B-cell protein epitope and developing critical parameters for its identification is one of the long standing interests. Using Layers algorithm, we introduced the concept of anchor residues to identify epitope. We have shown that majority of the epitope is composed of anchor residues and have significant bias in epitope for these residues. We optimized the search space reduction for epitope identification. We used Layers to non-randomly sample the antigen surface reducing the molecular surface to an average of 75 residues while preserving 50% of the epitope in the sample surface. To facilitate the comparison of favorite methods of researchers we compared the popular techniques used to identify epitope with their sampling performance and evaluation. We proposed an optimum Sr of 16 {\AA} to sample the antigen molecules to reduce the search space, in which epitope is identified using buried surface area method. We used the combinations of molecular surface sampling, anchor residue intensity in surface, secondary structure and sequence information to predict epitope at an accuracy of 89%. A web application is made available at http://www.csb.iitkgp.ernet.in/applications/b_cell_epitope_pred/main.
q-bio.BM:N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glycoproteins in the brain central to learning and memory. The effects of glycosylation on the structure and dynamics of NMDARs are largely unknown. In this work, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations of GluN1 and GluN2B ligand binding domains (LBDs) of NMDARs to investigate these effects. Our simulations predict that intra-domain interactions involving the glycan attached to residue GluN1-N440 stabilize closed-clamshell conformations of the GluN1 LBD. The glycan on GluN2B-N688 shows a similar, though weaker, effect. Based on these results, and assuming the transferability of the results of LBD simulations to the full receptor, we predict that glycans at GluN1-N440 might play a potentiator role in NMDARs. To validate this prediction, we perform electrophysiological analysis of full-length NMDARs with a glycosylation-preventing GluN1-N440Q mutation, and demonstrate an increase in the glycine EC50 value. Overall, our results suggest an intramolecular potentiating role of glycans on NMDA receptors.
q-bio.BM:In this paper, we introduce multiscale persistent functions for biomolecular structure characterization. The essential idea is to combine our multiscale rigidity functions with persistent homology analysis, so as to construct a series of multiscale persistent functions, particularly multiscale persistent entropies, for structure characterization. To clarify the fundamental idea of our method, the multiscale persistent entropy model is discussed in great detail. Mathematically, unlike the previous persistent entropy or topological entropy, a special resolution parameter is incorporated into our model. Various scales can be achieved by tuning its value. Physically, our multiscale persistent entropy can be used in conformation entropy evaluation. More specifically, it is found that our method incorporates in it a natural classification scheme. This is achieved through a density filtration of a multiscale rigidity function built from bond and/or dihedral angle distributions. To further validate our model, a systematical comparison with the traditional entropy evaluation model is done. It is found that our model is able to preserve the intrinsic topological features of biomolecular data much better than traditional approaches, particularly for resolutions in the mediate range. Moreover, our method can be successfully used in protein classification. For a test database with around nine hundred proteins, a clear separation between all-alpha and all-beta proteins can be achieved, using only the dihedral and pseudo-bond angle information. Finally, a special protein structure index (PSI) is proposed, for the first time, to describe the "regularity" of protein structures. Essentially, PSI can be used to describe the "regularity" information in any systems.
q-bio.BM:Using a structure-based coarse-grained model of proteins, we study the mechanism of unfolding of knotted proteins through heating. We find that the dominant mechanisms of unfolding depend on the temperature applied and are generally distinct from those identified for folding at its optimal temperature. In particular, for shallowly knotted proteins, folding usually involves formation of two loops whereas unfolding through high-temperature heating is dominated by untying of single loops. Untying the knots is found to generally precede unfolding unless the protein is deeply knotted and the heating temperature exceeds a threshold value. We then use a phenomenological model of the air-water interface to show that such an interface can untie shallow knots, but it can also make knots in proteins that are natively unknotted.
q-bio.BM:Identifying protein functional sites (PFSs) and protein-ligand interactions (PLIs) are critically important in understanding the protein function and the involved biochemical reactions. As large amount of unknown proteins are quickly accumulated in this post-genome era, an urgent task arises to predict PFSs and PLIs at residual level. Nowadays many knowledge-based methods have been well developed for prediction of PFSs, however, accurate methods for PLI prediction are still lacking. In this study, we have presented a new method for prediction of PLIs and PFSs based on sequence of the inquiry protein. The key of the method hinges on a function- and interaction-annotated protein domain profile database, called fiDPD, which was built from the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database, using a hidden Markov model program. The method was applied to 13 target proteins from the recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP10/11). Our calculations gave a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.66 for prediction of PFSs, and an 80% recall in prediction of PLIs. Our method reveals that PLIs are conserved during the evolution of proteins, and they can be reliably predicted from fiDPD. fiDPD can be used as a complement to existent bioinformatics tools for protein function annotation.
q-bio.BM:The key finding in the DNA double helix model is the specific pairing or binding between nucleotides A-T and C-G, and the pairing rules are the molecule basis of genetic code. Unfortunately, no such rules have been discovered for proteins. Here we show that similar rules and intrinsic sequence patterns between intra-protein binding peptide fragments do exist, and they can be extracted using a deep learning algorithm. Multi-millions of binding and non-binding peptide fragments from currently available protein X-ray structures are classified with an accuracy of up to 93%. This discovery has the potential in helping solve protein folding and protein-protein interaction problems, two open and fundamental problems in molecular biology.
q-bio.BM:Proteins have evolved to perform diverse cellular functions, from serving as reaction catalysts to coordinating cellular propagation and development. Frequently, proteins do not exert their full potential as monomers but rather undergo concerted interactions as either homo-oligomers or with other proteins as hetero-oligomers. The experimental study of such protein complexes and interactions has been arduous. Theoretical structure prediction methods are an attractive alternative. Here, we investigate homo-oligomeric interfaces by tracing residue coevolution via the global statistical Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA). DCA can accurately infer spatial adjacencies between residues. These adjacencies can be included as constraints in structure-prediction techniques to predict high-resolution models. By taking advantage of the on-going exponential growth of sequence databases, we go significantly beyond anecdotal cases of a few protein families and apply DCA to a systematic large-scale study of nearly 2000 PFAM protein families with sufficient sequence information and structurally resolved homo-oligomeric interfaces. We find that large interfaces are commonly identified by DCA. We further demonstrate that DCA can differentiate between subfamilies of different binding modes within one large PFAM family. Sequence derived contact information for the subfamilies proves sufficient to assemble accurate structural models of the diverse protein-oligomers. Thus, we provide an approach to investigate oligomerization for arbitrary protein families leading to structural models complementary to often difficult experimental methods. Combined with ever more abundant sequential data, we anticipate that this study will be instrumental to allow the structural description of many hetero-protein complexes in the future.
q-bio.BM:Liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is a major undergirding factor in the regulated formation of membraneless organelles in the cell. The phase behavior of an IDP is sensitive to its amino acid sequence. Here we apply a recent random-phase-approximation polymer theory to investigate how the tendency for multiple chains of a protein to phase separate, as characterized by the critical temperature $T^*_{\rm cr}$, is related to the protein's single-chain average radius of gyration $\langle R_{\rm g} \rangle$. For a set of sequences containing different permutations of an equal number of positively and negatively charged residues, we found a striking correlation $T^*_{\rm cr}\sim \langle R_{\rm g} \rangle^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma$ as large as $\sim 6.0$, indicating that electrostatic effects have similarly significant impact on promoting single-chain conformational compactness and phase separation. Moreover, $T^*_{\rm cr}\propto -{\rm SCD}$, where SCD is a recently proposed "sequence charge decoration" parameter determined solely by sequence information. Ramifications of our findings for deciphering the sequence dependence of IDP phase separation are discussed.
q-bio.BM:Natural protein sequences contain a record of their history. A common constraint in a given protein family is the ability to fold to specific structures, and it has been shown possible to infer the main native ensemble by analyzing covariations in extant sequences. Still, many natural proteins that fold into the same structural topology show different stabilization energies, and these are often related to their physiological behavior. We propose a description for the energetic variation given by sequence modifications in repeat proteins, systems for which the overall problem is simplified by their inherent symmetry. We explicitly account for single amino acid and pair-wise interactions and treat higher order correlations with a single term. We show that the resulting force field can be interpreted with structural detail. We trace the variations in the energetic scores of natural proteins and relate them to their experimental characterization. The resulting energetic force field allows the prediction of the folding free energy change for several mutants, and can be used to generate synthetic sequences that are statistically indistinguishable from the natural counterparts.
q-bio.BM:Herein (the first part of my work), I debunk the long-standing hypotheses that explain mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Simple calculations point out that mitochondria are highly proton-deficient microcosms and therefore, elaborate proton pump machinery are not tenable. Further, other elements like the elaborate electron transport chain, chemiosmosis, rotary ATP synthesis, etc. are also critically evaluated to point out that such complicated systems are non-viable. The communication necessitates a new explanatory paradigm for cellular respiration. In the second part of my work, I have put forward a viable alternative explanatory paradigm for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
q-bio.BM:Deciphering the links between amino acid sequence and amyloid fibril formation is key for understanding protein misfolding diseases. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study aggregation of short peptides in a coarse-grained model with hydrophobic-polar (HP) amino acid sequences and correlated side chain orientations for hydrophobic contacts. A significant heterogeneity is observed in the aggregate structures and in the thermodynamics of aggregation for systems of different HP sequences and different number of peptides. Fibril-like ordered aggregates are found for several sequences that contain the common HPH pattern while other sequences may form helix bundles or disordered aggregates. A wide variation of the aggregation transition temperatures among sequences, even among those of the same hydrophobic fraction, indicates that not all sequences undergo aggregation at a presumable physiological temperature. The transition is found to be the most cooperative for sequences forming fibril-like structures. For a fibril-prone sequence, it is shown that fibril formation follows the nucleation and growth mechanism. Interestingly, a binary mixture of peptides of an aggregation-prone and a non-aggregation-prone sequence shows association and conversion of the latter to the fibrillar structure. Our study highlights the role of sequence in selecting fibril-like aggregates and also the impact of structural template on fibril formation by peptides of unrelated sequences.
q-bio.BM:Collapsin response mediator protein CRMP2 (gene: DPYSL2) is crucial for neuronal development. The homotetrameric CRMP2 complex is regulated via two mechanisms, first by phosphorylation at, and second by reduction and oxidation of the Cys504 residues of two adjacent subunits. Here, we analyzed the effects of this redox switch on the protein in vitro combined with force field molecular dynamics (MD). Earlier X-ray data contain the structure of the rigid body of the molecule but lack the flexible C-terminus with the important sites for phosphorylation and redox regulation. An in silico model for this part was established by replica exchange simulations and homology modelling, which is consistent with results gained from CD spectroscopy with recombinant protein. Thermofluor data indicated that the protein aggregates at bivalent ion concentrations below 200 mM. In simulations the protein surface was covered at these conditions by large amounts of ions, which most likely prevent aggregation. A tryptophan residue (Trp295) in close proximity to the forming disulfide allowed the measurement of the structural relaxation of the rigid body upon reduction by fluorescent quenching. We were also able to determine the second order rate constant of CRMP2 oxidation by H2O2. The simulated solvent accessible surface of the hydroxyl group of Ser518 significantly increased upon reduction of the disulfide bond. Our results give first detailed insight in the profound structural changes of the tetrameric CRMP2 due to oxidation and indicate a tightly connected regulation by phosphorylation and redox modification.
q-bio.BM:Because of the limitations of classical silicon based computational technology, several alternatives to traditional method in form of unconventional computing have been proposed. In this paper we will focus on DNA computing which is showing the possibility of excellence for its massive parallelism, potential for information storage, speed and energy efficiency. In this paper we will describe how syllogistic reasoning by DNA tweezers can be presented by the semantics of process calculus and DNA strand graph. Syllogism is an essential ingredient for commonsense reasoning of an individual. This paper enlightens the procedure to deduce a precise conclusion from a set of propositions by using formal language theory in form of process calculus and the expressive power of DNA strand graph.
q-bio.BM:Recent experiments and simulations have demonstrated that proteins can fold on the ribosome. However, the extent and generality of fitness effects resulting from co-translational folding remain open questions. Here we report a genome-wide analysis that uncovers evidence of evolutionary selection for co-translational folding. We describe a robust statistical approach to identify loci within genes that are both significantly enriched in slowly translated codons and evolutionarily conserved. Surprisingly, we find that domain boundaries can explain only a small fraction of these conserved loci. Instead, we propose that regions enriched in slowly translated codons are associated with co-translational folding intermediates, which may be smaller than a single domain. We show that the intermediates predicted by a native-centric model of co-translational folding account for the majority of these loci across more than 500 E. coli proteins. By making a direct connection to protein folding, this analysis provides strong evidence that many synonymous substitutions have been selected to optimize translation rates at specific locations within genes. More generally, our results indicate that kinetics, and not just thermodynamics, can significantly alter the efficiency of self-assembly in a biological context.
q-bio.BM:A free energy landscape estimation-method based on Bayesian inference is presented and used for comparing the efficiency of thermally enhanced sampling methods with respect to regular molecular dynamics, where the simulations are carried out on two binding states of calmodulin. The proposed free energy estimation method (the GM method) is compared to other estimators using a toy model showing that the GM method provides a robust estimate not subject to overfitting. The continuous nature of the GM method, as well as predictive inference on the number of basis functions, provide better estimates on sparse data. We find that the free energy diffusion proper- ties determine sampling method effectiveness, such that the diffusion dominated apo-calmodulin is most efficiently sampled by regular molecular dynamics, while the holo with its rugged free energy landscape is better sampled by enhanced methods.
q-bio.BM:Transcription is regulated through binding factors to gene promoters to activate or repress expression, however, the mechanisms by which factors find targets remain unclear. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we determined in vivo stoichiometry and spatiotemporal dynamics of a GFP tagged repressor, Mig1, from a paradigm signaling pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find the repressor operates in clusters, which upon extracellular signal detection, translocate from the cytoplasm, bind to nuclear targets and turnover. Simulations of Mig1 configuration within a 3D yeast genome model combined with a promoter-specific, fluorescent translation reporter confirmed clusters are the functional unit of gene regulation. In vitro and structural analysis on reconstituted Mig1 suggests that clusters are stabilized by depletion forces between intrinsically disordered sequences. We observed similar clusters of a co-regulatory activator from a different pathway, supporting a generalized cluster model for transcription factors that reduces promoter search times through intersegment transfer while stabilizing gene expression.
q-bio.BM:The ionic environment of biomolecules strongly influences their structure, conformational stability, and inter-molecular interactions.This paper introduces GIBS, a grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation program for computing the thermodynamic properties of ion solutions and their distributions around biomolecules. This software implements algorithms that automate the excess chemical potential calculations for a given target salt concentration. GIBS uses a cavity-bias algorithm to achieve high sampling acceptance rates for inserting ions and solvent hard spheres in simulating dense ionic systems. In the current version, ion-ion interactions are described using Coulomb, hard-sphere, or Lennard-Jones (L-J) potentials; solvent-ion interactions are described using hard-sphere, L-J and attractive square-well potentials; and, solvent-solvent interactions are described using hard-sphere repulsions. This paper and the software package includes examples of using GIBS to compute the ion excess chemical potentials and mean activity coefficients of sodium chloride as well as to compute the cylindrical radial distribution functions of monovalent (Na$^+$, Rb$^+$), divalent (Sr$^{2+}$), and trivalent (CoHex$^{3+}$) around fixed all-atom models of 25 base-pair nucleic acid duplexes. GIBS is written in C++ and is freely available community use; it can be downloaded at https://github.com/Electrostatics/GIBS.
q-bio.BM:We used a microfluidic platform to address the problems of obtaining diffraction quality crystals and crystal handling during transfer to the X-ray diffractometer. We optimize crystallization conditions of a pharmaceutical protein and collect X-ray data both in situ and ex situ.
q-bio.BM:Since there is now a growing wish by referees to judge the underpinning data for a submitted article it is timely to provide a summary of the data evaluation checks required to be done by a referee. As these checks will vary from field to field this article focuses on the needs of biological X-ray crystallography articles, which is the predominantly used method leading to depositions in the PDB. The expected referee checks of data underpinning an article are described with examples. These checks necessarily include that a referee checks the PDB validation report for each crystal structure accompanying the article submission; this check whilst necessary is not sufficient for a complete evaluation. A referee would be expected to undertake one cycle of model refinement of the authors biological macromolecule coordinates against the authors processed diffraction data and look at the various validation checks of the model and Fo-Fc electron density maps in e.g. Phenix_refine and in COOT. If the referee deems necessary the diffraction data images should be reprocessed (e.g. to a different diffraction resolution than the authors submission). This can be requested to be done by the authors or if the referee prefers can be undertaken directly by the referee themselves. A referee wishing to do these data checks may wish to receive a certificate that they have command of these data science skills. The organisation of such voluntary certification training can e.g. be via those crystallography associations duly recognised by the IUCr to issue such certificates.
q-bio.BM:A mathematico-physically valid formulation is required to infer properties of disordered protein conformations from single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET). Conformational dimensions inferred by conventional approaches that presume a homogeneous conformational ensemble can be unphysical. When all possible---heterogeneous as well as homogeneous---conformational distributions are taken into account without prejudgement, a single value of average transfer efficiency $\langle E\rangle$ between dyes at two chain ends is generally consistent with highly diverse, multiple values of the average radius of gyration $\langle R_{\rm g}\rangle$. Here we utilize unbiased conformational statistics from a coarse-grained explicit-chain model to establish a general logical framework to quantify this fundamental ambiguity in smFRET inference. As an application, we address the long-standing controversy regarding the denaturant dependence of $\langle R_{\rm g}\rangle$ of unfolded proteins, focusing on Protein L as an example. Conventional smFRET inference concluded that $\langle R_{\rm g}\rangle$ of unfolded Protein L is highly sensitive to [GuHCl], but data from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) suggested a near-constant $\langle R_{\rm g}\rangle$ irrespective of [GuHCl]. Strikingly, the present analysis indicates that although the reported $\langle E\rangle$ values for Protein L at [GuHCl] = 1 M and 7 M are very different at 0.75 and 0.45, respectively, the Bayesian $R^2_{\rm g}$ distributions consistent with these two $\langle E\rangle$ values overlap by as much as $75\%$. Our findings suggest, in general, that the smFRET-SAXS discrepancy regarding unfolded protein dimensions likely arise from highly heterogeneous conformational ensembles at low or zero denaturant, and that additional experimental probes are needed to ascertain the nature of this heterogeneity.
q-bio.BM:At 49 C erythrocytes undergo morphological changes due to an internal force, but the origin of the force that drives changes is not clear. Here we point out that our recent experiments on thermally induced force-release in hemoglobin can provide an explanation for the morphological changes of erythrocytes.
q-bio.BM:Proteins perform their functions usually by interacting with other proteins. Predicting which proteins interact is a fundamental problem. Experimental methods are slow, expensive, and have a high rate of error. Many computational methods have been proposed among which sequence-based ones are very promising. However, so far no such method is able to predict effectively the entire human interactome: they require too much time or memory. We present SPRINT (Scoring PRotein INTeractions), a new sequence-based algorithm and tool for predicting protein-protein interactions. We comprehensively compare SPRINT with state-of-the-art programs on seven most reliable human PPI datasets and show that it is more accurate while running orders of magnitude faster and using very little memory. SPRINT is the only program that can predict the entire human interactome. Our goal is to transform the very challenging problem of predicting the entire human interactome into a routine task. The source code of SPRINT is freely available from github.com/lucian-ilie/SPRINT/ and the datasets and predicted PPIs from www.csd.uwo.ca/faculty/ilie/SPRINT/.
q-bio.BM:Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a binding protein that regulates availability of steroids hormones in the plasma. Although best known as steroid carrier, studies have associated SHBG in modulating behavioral aspects related to sexual receptivity. Among steroids, estradiol (17\b{eta}-estradiol, oestradiol or E2) is well recognized as the most active endogenous female hormone, exerting important roles in reproductive and nonreproductive functions. Thus, in this study we aimed to employ molecular dynamics (MD) and docking techniques for quantifying the interaction energy between a complex aqueous solution, composed by different salts, SHBG and E2. Due to glucose concentration resembles those observed in diabetic levels, special emphasis was devoted to uncover the main consequences of this carbohydrate on the SHBG and E2 molecules. We also examined possible energetic changes due to solution on the binding energy of SHBG-E2 complex. In this framework, our calculations uncovered a remarkable interaction energy between glucose and SHBG surface. Surprisingly, we also observed solute components movement toward SHBG yielding clusters surrounding the protein. This finding, corroborated by the higher energy and shorter distance found between glucose and SHBG, suggests a scenario in favor of a detainment state. In addition, in spite of protein superficial area increment it does not exerted modification on binding site area nor over binding energy SHBG-E2 complex. Finally, our calculations also highlighted an interaction between E2 and glucose when the hormone was immersed in the solution. In summary, our findings contribute for a better comprehension of both SHBG and E2 interplay with aqueous solution components.
q-bio.BM:Atomic radii and charges are two major parameters used in implicit solvent electrostatics and energy calculations. The optimization problem for charges and radii is under-determined, leading to uncertainty in the values of these parameters and in the results of solvation energy calculations using these parameters. This paper presents a new method for quantifying this uncertainty in implicit solvation calculations of small molecules using surrogate models based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions. There are relatively few atom types used to specify radii parameters in implicit solvation calculations; therefore, surrogate models for these low-dimensional spaces could be constructed using least-squares fitting. However, there are many more types of atomic charges; therefore, construction of surrogate models for the charge parameter space requires compressed sensing combined with an iterative rotation method to enhance problem sparsity. We demonstrate the application of the method by presenting results for the uncertainties in small molecule solvation energies based on these approaches. The method presented in this paper is a promising approach for efficiently quantifying uncertainty in a wide range of force field parameterization problems, including those beyond continuum solvation calculations.The intent of this study is to provide a way for developers of implicit solvent model parameter sets to understand the sensitivity of their target properties (solvation energy) on underlying choices for solute radius and charge parameters.
q-bio.BM:The Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) software was developed to solve the equations of continuum electrostatics for large biomolecular assemblages that has provided impact in the study of a broad range of chemical, biological, and biomedical applications. APBS addresses three key technology challenges for understanding solvation and electrostatics in biomedical applications: accurate and efficient models for biomolecular solvation and electrostatics, robust and scalable software for applying those theories to biomolecular systems, and mechanisms for sharing and analyzing biomolecular electrostatics data in the scientific community. To address new research applications and advancing computational capabilities, we have continually updated APBS and its suite of accompanying software since its release in 2001. In this manuscript, we discuss the models and capabilities that have recently been implemented within the APBS software package including: a Poisson-Boltzmann analytical and a semi-analytical solver, an optimized boundary element solver, a geometry-based geometric flow solvation model, a graph theory based algorithm for determining p$K_a$ values, and an improved web-based visualization tool for viewing electrostatics.
q-bio.BM:We present a parameterized analytical model of alchemical molecular binding. The model describes accurately the free energy profiles of linear single-decoupling alchemical binding free energy calculations. The parameters of the model, which are physically motivated, are obtained by fitting model predictions to numerical simulations. The validity of the model has been assessed on a set of host-guest complexes. The model faithfully reproduces both the binding free energy profiles and the probability densities of the perturbation energy as a function of the alchemical progress parameter $\lambda$. The model offers a rationalization for the characteristic shape of the free energy profiles. The parameters obtained from the model are potentially useful descriptors of the association equilibrium of molecular complexes.
q-bio.BM:Many biologically important ligands of proteins are large, flexible, and often charged molecules that bind to extended regions on the protein surface. It is infeasible or expensive to locate such ligands on proteins with standard methods such as docking or molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The alternative approach proposed here is the scanning of a spatial and angular grid around the protein with smaller fragments of the large ligand. Energy values for complete grids can be computed efficiently with a well-known Fast Fourier Transform accelerated algorithm and a physically meaningful interaction model. We show that the approach can readily incorporate flexibility of protein and ligand. The energy grids (EGs) resulting from the ligand fragment scans can be transformed into probability distributions, and then directly compared to probability distributions estimated from MD simulations and experimental structural data. We test the approach on a diverse set of complexes between proteins and large, flexible ligands, including a complex of Sonic Hedgehog protein and heparin, three heparin sulfate substrates or non-substrates of an epimerase, a multi-branched supramolecular ligand that stabilizes a protein-peptide complex, and a flexible zwitterionic ligand that binds to a surface basin of a Kringle domain. In all cases the EG approach gives results that are in good agreement with experimental data or MD simulations.
q-bio.BM:We use a coarse-grained model to study the conformational changes in two barley proteins, LTP1 and its ligand adduct isoform LTP1b, that result from their adsorption to the air-water interface. The model introduces the interface through hydropathy indices. We justify the model by all-atom simulations. The choice of the proteins is motivated by making attempts to understand formation and stability of foam in beer. We demonstrate that both proteins flatten out at the interface and can make a continuous stabilizing and denser film. We show that the degree of the flattening depends on the protein -- the layers of LTP1b should be denser than those of LTP1 -- and on the presence of glycation. It also depends on the number ($\le 4$) of the disulfide bonds in the proteins. The geometry of the proteins is sensitive to the specificity of the absent bonds. We provide estimates of the volume of cavities of the proteins when away from the interface.
q-bio.BM:We consider multi-chain protein native structures and propose a criterion that determines whether two chains in the system are entangled or not. The criterion is based on the behavior observed by pulling at both temini of each chain simultaneously in the two chains. We have identified about 900 entangled systems in the Protein Data Bank and provided a more detailed analysis for several of them. We argue that entanglement enhances the thermodynamic stability of the system but it may have other functions: burying the hydrophobic residues at the interface, and increasing the DNA or RNA binding area. We also study the folding and stretching properties of the knotted dimeric proteins MJ0366, YibK and bacteriophytochrome. These proteins have been studied theoretically in their monomeric versions so far. The dimers are seen to separate on stretching through the tensile mechanism and the characteristic unraveling force depends on the pulling direction.
q-bio.BM:DDX3X is a human DEAD-box RNA helicase implicated in many cancers and in viral progression. In addition to the RecA-like catalytic core, DDX3X contains N- and C-terminal domains. Here, we investigate the substrate and protein requirements to support the ATPase activity of a DDX3X construct lacking 80 residues from its C-terminal domain. Our data confirmed previous results that for an RNA molecule to support the ATPase activity of DDX3X it must contain a single-stranded-double-stranded region. We investigated protein and RNA structural reasons for this requirement. First, the RNA substrates consisting only of a double-helix were unable to support DDX3X binding. A single-stranded RNA substrate supported DDX3X binding, while an RNA substrate consisting of a single-stranded-double-stranded region not only supported the binding of DDX3X to RNA, but also promoted DDX3X trimer formation. Thus, the single-stranded-double-stranded RNA region is needed for DDX3X trimer formation, and trimer formation is required for ATPase activity. Interestingly, the dependence of ATP hydrolysis on the protein concentration suggests that the DDX3X trimer hydrolyzes only two molecules of ATP. Lastly, a DNA substrate that contains single-stranded-double-stranded regions does not support the ATPase activity of DDX3X.
q-bio.BM:RNA secondary structure folding kinetics is known to be important for the biological function of certain processes, such as the hok/sok system in E. coli. Although linear algebra provides an exact computational solution of secondary structure folding kinetics with respect to the Turner energy model for tiny (~ 20 nt) RNA sequences, the folding kinetics for larger sequences can only be approximated by binning structures into macrostates in a coarse-grained model, or by repeatedly simulating secondary structure folding with either the Monte Carlo algorithm or the Gillespie algorithm. Here we investigate the relation between the Monte Carlo algorithm and the Gillespie algorithm. We prove that asymptotically, the expected time for a K-step trajectory of the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to <N> times that of the Gillespie algorithm, where <N> denotes the Boltzmann expected network degree. If the network is regular (i.e. every node has the same degree), then the mean first passage time (MFPT) computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to MFPT computed by the Gillespie algorithm multiplied by <N>; however, this is not true for non-regular networks. In particular, RNA secondary structure folding kinetics, as computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm, is not equal to the folding kinetics, as computed by the Gillespie algorithm, although the mean first passage times are roughly correlated. Simulation software for RNA secondary structure folding according to the Monte Carlo and Gille- spie algorithms is publicly available, as is our software to compute the expected degree of the net- work of secondary structures of a given RNA sequence { see http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clote/ RNAexpNumNbors.
q-bio.BM:In response to cold stress, Drosophila Melanogaster increase their expression of Frost, a candidate gene involved in cold response. The direct role of Frost in cold tolerance is yet to be determined, and its importance for survival in cold environments has been questioned. In this study, I attempt to better understand the molecular machinery of Frost by selecting for its protein in fly lysate knowing only its RNA has been found. Detection of Frost expression and subsequently studying its protein will hopefully lead to enhanced comprehension of cold responses in insects, which is the long-term goal of this research. I predict that Frost will be expressed in flies that undergo cold stress at 0oC for 2 hours before recovering at 220C for 3 hours before lysing. Two Western blots were executed using fly lysate that underwent the above treatment, whose antibodies were specific to Frost. No bands were seen in any of the lanes containing treated samples in either of the Immunoblots, indicating that Frost was either not expressed or not detected in fly lysate.
q-bio.BM:Biologically functional liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is driven by interactions encoded by their amino acid sequences. Little is currently known about the molecular recognition mechanisms for distributing different IDP sequences into various cellular membraneless compartments. Pertinent physics was addressed recently by applying random-phase-approximation (RPA) polymer theory to electrostatics, which is a major energetic component governing IDP phase properties. RPA accounts for charge patterns and thus has advantages over Flory-Huggins and Overbeek-Voorn mean-field theories. To make progress toward deciphering the phase behaviors of multiple IDP sequences, the RPA formulation for one IDP species plus solvent is hereby extended to treat polyampholyte solutions containing two IDP species. The new formulation generally allows for binary coexistence of two phases, each containing a different set of volume fractions $(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ for the two different IDP sequences. The asymmetry between the two predicted coexisting phases with regard to their $\phi_1/\phi_2$ ratios for the two sequences increases with increasing mismatch between their charge patterns. This finding points to a multivalent, stochastic, "fuzzy" mode of molecular recognition that helps populate various IDP sequences differentially into separate phase compartments. An intuitive illustration of this trend is provided by Flory-Huggins models, whereby a hypothetical case of ternary coexistence is also explored. Augmentations of the present RPA theory with a relative permittivity $\epsilon_{\rm r}(\phi)$ that depends on IDP volume fraction $\phi=\phi_1+\phi_2$ lead to higher propensities to phase separate, in line with the case with one IDP species we studied previously. ...
q-bio.BM:Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) perform important roles on biological functions. Researches of mutants on protein interactions can further understand PPIs. In the past, many researchers have developed databases that stored mutants on protein interactions, which are old and not updated till now. To address the issue, we developed a kinetic and thermodynamic database of mutant protein interactions (dbMPIKT) that can be freely accessible at our website. This database contains 5291 mutants that integrated data from previous databases and data from literatures for nearly three years. Furthermore, the data were analyzed, involving mutation number, mutation type, protein pair source and network map construction. On the whole, the database provides new data to further improve the study on PPIs. Website: http://210.45.212.128/lqy/index.php
q-bio.BM:Due to the asymmetric nature of the nucleotides, the extant informational biomolecule, DNA, is constrained to replicate unidirectionally on a template. As a product of molecular evolution that sought to maximize replicative potential, DNA's unidirectional replication poses a mystery since symmetric bidirectional self-replicators obviously would replicate faster than unidirectional self-replicators and hence would have been evolutionarily more successful. Here we carefully examine the physico-chemical requirements for evolutionarily successful primordial self-replicators and theoretically show that at low monomer concentrations that possibly prevailed in the primordial oceans, asymmetric unidirectional self-replicators would have an evolutionary advantage over bidirectional self-replicators. The competing requirements of low and high kinetic barriers for formation and long lifetime of inter-strand bonds respectively are simultaneously satisfied through asymmetric kinetic influence of inter-strand bonds, resulting in evolutionarily successful unidirectional self-replicators.
q-bio.BM:Allostery is an intrinsic spatiotemporal property of all proteins, resulting from long range correlations in the order of several nanometers and time scales of nanoseconds. Information is carried asymmetrically from one part to another by entropy transfer. Here, we present a master equation model of allosteric communication in proteins based on the transfer entropy concept of Schreiber (PRL, 85, 465, 2000). We show how the model relates the path and velocity of asymmetric entropy transfer to conformational transitions over the rugged energy surface of proteins and how this relates to function.
q-bio.BM:The prevalent method for RNA secondary structure prediction for a single sequence is free energy minimization based on the nearest neighbor thermodynamic model (NNTM). One of the least well-developed parts of the model is the energy function assigned to the multibranch loops. Parametric analysis can be performed to elucidate the dependance of the prediction on the branching parameters used in the NNTM. Since the objective function is linear, this boils down to analyzing the normal fans of the branching polytopes. Here we show that because of the way the multibranch loops are scored under the NNTM, certain branching patterns are possible for all sequences. We do this by characterizing the dominant parts of the parameter space obtained by looking at the relevant section of the normal fan; therefore, we conclude that the structures that are normally found in nature are obtained for a relatively small set of parameters.
q-bio.BM:In this paper, a multiscale virtual particle based elastic network model (MVP-ENM) is proposed for biomolecular normal mode analysis. The multiscale virtual particle model is proposed for the discretization of biomolecular density data in different scales. Essentially, the model works as the coarse-graining of the biomolecular structure, so that a delicate balance between biomolecular geometric representation and computational cost can be achieved. To form "connections" between these multiscale virtual particles, a new harmonic potential function, which considers the influence from both mass distributions and distance relations, is adopted between any two virtual particles. Unlike the previous ENMs that use a constant spring constant, a particle-dependent spring parameter is used in MVP-ENM. Two independent models, i.e., multiscale virtual particle based Gaussian network model (MVP-GNM) and multiscale virtual particle based anisotropic network model (MVP-ANM), are proposed. Even with a rather coarse grid and a low resolution, the MVP-GNM is able to predict the Debye-Waller factors (B-factors) with considerable good accuracy. Similar properties have also been observed in MVP-ANM. More importantly, in B-factor predictions, the mismatch between the predicted results and experimental ones is predominantly from higher fluctuation regions. Further, it is found that MVP-ANM can deliver a very consistent low-frequency eigenmodes in various scales. This demonstrates the great potential of MVP-ANM in the deformation analysis of low resolution data. With the multiscale rigidity function, the MVP-ENM can be applied to biomolecular data represented in density distribution and atomic coordinates. Further, the great advantage of my MVP-ENM model in computational cost has been demonstrated by using two poliovirus virus structures. Finally, the paper ends with a conclusion.
q-bio.BM:We have extended our analytically derived PDB-NMA formulation, ATMAN [1], to include protein dimers using mixed internal and Cartesian coordinates. A test case on a 1.3\AA\ resolution model of a small homodimer, ActVA-ORF6, consisting of two 112-residue subunits identically folded in a compact 50\AA\ sphere, reproduces the distinct experimental Debye-Waller motility asymmetry for the two chains, demonstrating that structure sensitively selects vibrational signatures. The vibrational analysis of this PDB entry, together with biochemical and crystallographic data, demonstrates the cooperative nature of the dimeric interaction of the two subunits and suggests a mechanical model for subunit interconversion during the catalytic cycle.
q-bio.BM:Leucine zippers are alpha helical monomers dimerized to a coiled coil structure. Various scenarios for dimerization span interaction of unstructured monomers that form alpha helices in the process of dimerization to preformed alpha helical monomers dimerizing.Another suggested possibility, a trigger sequence hypothesis (M. O. Steinmetz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007, 104, 7062-7067), is that a C terminal (CT) part of each monomer is a trigger sequence that is dimerized and, subsequently, the remainder N terminal (NT) part of each monomer (that is partially ordered) zips together to form the coiled coil. In this work, methods are developed to computationally explore the trigger sequence hypothesis based on an extension of a previously introduced (R. I. Cukier, J. Chem. Phys. 2011, 134, 045104) Hamiltonian Temperature Replica Exchange Method Mean Square (HTREM_MS) procedure, which scales the Hamiltonian in both potential and kinetic energies, to enhance sampling generically, along with additional restraints to enhance sampling in desired regions of conformational space. The method is applied to a 31-residue truncation of the 33-residue leucine zipper (GCN4-p1) of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4. Using a variety of HTREM_MS simulations, we find that the NT of one monomer of the dimer becomes disordered when the NT parts of the monomers are separated. In contrast, when the CT parts of the monomers are separated, both monomers remain alpha helical. These simulations suggest that the CT does act as a trigger sequence and are consistent with a disordered NT. We also investigate whether the disordered NT can be induced to re-form the dimerized leucine zipper. It does, but with some lack of recovery of alpha helical hydrogen bonding structure in the NT.
q-bio.BM:Predicting three dimensional residue-residue contacts from evolutionary information in protein sequences was attempted already in the early 1990s. However, contact prediction accuracies of methods evaluated in CASP experiments before CASP11 remained quite low, typically with $<20$% true positives. Recently, contact prediction has been significantly improved to the level that an accurate three dimensional model of a large protein can be generated on the basis of predicted contacts. This improvement was attained by disentangling direct from indirect correlations in amino acid covariations or cosubstitutions between sites in protein evolution. Here, we review statistical methods for extracting causative correlations and various approaches to describe protein structure, complex, and flexibility based on predicted contacts.
q-bio.BM:We investigate the effects of the relative dielectric coefficient on ionic flows in open ion channels, using mathematical analysis of reasonably general Poisson-Nernst-Planck type models that can include the finite sizes of ions. The value of the relative dielectric coefficient is of course a crucial parameter for ionic behavior in general. Using the powerful theory of singularly perturbed problems in applied mathematics, we show that some properties of open channels are quite insensitive to variation in the relative dielectric coefficient, thereby explaining such effects seen unexpectedly in simulations. The ratio between the total number of one ion species and that of another ion species, and the ratio between the flux of one ion species and that of another ion species do not depend significantly on the relative dielectric coefficient.
q-bio.BM:Natural protein molecules are exceptional polymers. Encoded in apparently random strings of amino-acids, these objects perform clear physical tasks that are rare to find by simple chance. Accurate folding, specific binding, powerful catalysis, are examples of basic chemical activities that the great majority of polypeptides do not display, and are thought to be the outcome of the natural history of proteins. Function, a concept genuine to Biology, is at the core of evolution and often conflicts with the physical constraints. Locating the frustration between discrepant goals in a recurrent system leads to fundamental insights about the chances and necessities that shape the encoding of biological information.
q-bio.BM:The ability to precisely visualize the atomic geometry of the interactions between a drug and its protein target in structural models is critical in predicting the correct modifications in previously identified inhibitors to create more effective next generation drugs. It is currently common practice among medicinal chemists while attempting the above to access the information contained in three-dimensional structures by using two-dimensional projections, which can preclude disclosure of useful features. A more precise visualization of the three-dimensional configuration of the atomic geometry in the models can be achieved through the implementation of immersive virtual reality (VR). In this work, we present a freely available software pipeline for visualising protein structures through VR. New customer hardware, such as the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift utilized in this study, are available at reasonable prices. Moreover, we have combined VR visualization with fast algorithms for simulating intramolecular motions of protein flexibility, in an effort to further improve structure-lead drug design by exposing molecular interactions that might be hidden in the less informative static models.
q-bio.BM:Molecular dynamics simulation is used to model the self-assembly of polyhedral shells containing 180 trapezoidal particles that correspond to the T=3 virus capsid. Three kinds of particle, differing only slightly in shape, are used to account for the effect of quasi-equivalence. Bond formation between particles is reversible and an explicit atomistic solvent is included. Under suitable conditions the simulations are able to produce complete shells, with the majority of unused particles remaining as monomers, and practically no other clusters. There are also no incorrectly assembled clusters. The simulations reveal details of intermediate structures along the growth pathway, information that is relevant for interpreting experiment.
q-bio.BM:While a monomer of the ubiquitous hormone insulin is the biologically active form in the human body, its hexameric assembly acts as an efficient storage unit. However, the role of water molecules in the structure, stability and dynamics of the insulin hexamer is poorly understood. Here we combine experimental data with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the shape, structure and stability of an insulin hexamer focusing on the role of water molecules. Both X-Ray analysis and computer simulations show that the core of the hexamer cavity is barrel-shaped, holding, on an average, sixteen water molecules. These encapsulated and constrained molecules impart structural stability to the hexamer. Apart from the electrostatic interactions with Zn2+ ions, an intricate hydrogen bond network amongst cavity water and neighboring protein residues stabilizes the hexameric association. These water molecules solvate six glutamate residues inside the cavity decreasing electrostatic repulsions amongst the negatively charged carboxylate groups. They also prevent association between glutamate residues and Zn2+ ions and maintain the integrity of the cavity. Simulations reveal that removal of these waters results in a collapse of the cavity. Subsequent analyses also show that the hydrogen bond network among these water molecules and protein residues that face the inner side of the cavity is more rigid with a slower relaxation as compared to that of the bulk solvent. Dynamics of cavity water reveal certain slow water molecules which form the back bone of the stable hydrogen bond network. The analysis presented here suggests a dominant role of structurally conserved water molecules in maintaining the integrity of the hexameric assembly and potentially modulating the dissociation of this assembly into the functional monomeric form.
q-bio.BM:The Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase is an essential component of cardiac electrophysiology, maintaining physiological Na$^+$ and K$^+$ concentrations over successive heart beats. Terkildsen et al. (2007) developed a model of the ventricular myocyte Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase to study extracellular potassium accumulation during ischaemia, demonstrating the ability to recapitulate a wide range of experimental data, but unfortunately there was no archived code associated with the original manuscript. Here we detail an updated version of the model and provide CellML and MATLAB code to ensure reproducibility and reusability. We note some errors within the original formulation which have been corrected to ensure that the model is thermodynamically consistent, and although this required some reparameterisation, the resulting model still provides a good fit to experimental measurements that demonstrate the dependence of Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase pumping rate upon membrane voltage and metabolite concentrations. To demonstrate thermodynamic consistency we also developed a bond graph version of the model. We hope that these models will be useful for community efforts to assemble a whole-cell cardiomyocyte model which facilitates the investigation of cellular energetics.
q-bio.BM:Topology affects physical and biological properties of DNA and impacts fundamental cellular processes, such as gene expression, genome replication, chromosome structure and segregation. In all organisms DNA topology is carefully modulated and the supercoiling degree of defined genome regions may change according to physiological and environmental conditions. Elucidation of structural properties of DNA molecules with different topology may thus help to better understand genome functions. Whereas a number of structural studies have been published on highly negatively supercoiled DNA molecules, only preliminary observations of highly positively supercoiled are available, and a description of DNA structural properties over the full range of supercoiling degree is lacking. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool to study DNA structure at single molecule level. We here report a comprehensive analysis by AFM of DNA plasmid molecules with defined supercoiling degree, covering the full spectrum of biologically relevant topologies, under different observation conditions. Our data, supported by statistical and biochemical analyses, revealed striking differences in the behavior of positive and negative plasmid molecules.
q-bio.BM:Because human serum transferrin (hTF) exists freely in serum, it is a potential target for cancer treatment drugs and in curing iron-overloaded conditions in patients via long-term transfusion therapy. The understanding of the interactions between hTF and metal ions is very important for biological, pharmalogical, toxicological, and other protein engineering purposes. In this paper, a simple linear free energy correlation is proposed to predict the binding strength between hTF protein and metal cations. The stability constants for a family of metal-hTF complexes can be correlated to the non-solvation energies and the radii of cations. The binding strength is determined by both the physical properties (charge and size or ionic radius) and chemical properties (non-solvation energy) of a given cation. The binding strengths of either divalent and trivalent metals can then be predicted systematically.
q-bio.BM:We have introduced a Pareto sorting algorithm into Synopsis, a de novo design program that generates synthesizable molecules with desirable properties. We give a detailed description of the algorithm and illustrate its working in 2 different de novo design settings: the design of putative dual and selective FGFR and VEGFR inhibitors, and the successful design of organic structure determining agents (OSDAs) for the synthesis of zeolites. We show that the introduction of Pareto sorting not only enables the simultaneous optimization of multiple properties but also greatly improves the performance of the algorithm to generate molecules with hard-to-meet constraints. This in turn allows us to suggest approaches to address the problem of false positive hits in de novo structure based drug design by introducing structural and physicochemical constraints in the designed molecules, and by forcing essential interactions between these molecules and their target receptor.
q-bio.BM:Modern algorithms for de novo prediction of protein structures typically output multiple full-length models (decoys) rather than a single solution. Subsequent clustering of such decoys is used both to gauge the success of the modelling and to decide on the most native-like conformation. At the same time, partial protein models are sufficient for some applications such as crystallographic phasing by molecular replacement (MR) in particular, provided these models represent a certain part of the target structure with reasonable accuracy. Here we propose a novel clustering algorithm that natively operates in the space of partial models through an approach known as granular clustering (GC). The algorithm is based on growing local similarities found in a pool of initial decoys. We demonstrate that the resulting clusters of partial models provide a substantially more accurate structural detail on the target protein than those obtained upon a global alignment of decoys. As the result, the partial models output by our GC algorithm are also much more effective towards the MR procedure, compared to the models produced by existing software.

q-bio.BM:Pure and homogeneous biological macromolecules (i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid complexes, and functional assemblies such as ribosomes and viruses) are the key for consistent and reliable biochemical and biophysical measurements, as well as for reproducible crystallizations, best crystal diffraction properties, and exploitable electron microscopy images. Highlights: Pure and homogeneous macromolecules are the key for the best experimental results; They warrant the consistency and the reliability of biochemical and biophysical data; They give more reproducible crystallography and electron microscopy results as well.
q-bio.BM:This chapter gives a graceful introduction to problem of protein three- dimensional structure prediction, and focuses on how to make structural sense out of a single input sequence with unknown structure, the 'query' or 'target' sequence. We give an overview of the different classes of modelling techniques, notably template-based and template free. We also discuss the way in which structural predictions are validated within the global com- munity, and elaborate on the extent to which predicted structures may be trusted and used in practice. Finally we discuss whether the concept of a sin- gle fold pertaining to a protein structure is sustainable given recent insights. In short, we conclude that the general protein three-dimensional structure prediction problem remains unsolved, especially if we desire quantitative predictions. However, if a homologous structural template is available in the PDB model or reasonable to high accuracy may be generated.
q-bio.BM:This chapter deals with approaches for protein three-dimensional structure prediction, starting out from a single input sequence with unknown struc- ture, the 'query' or 'target' sequence. Both template based and template free modelling techniques are treated, and how resulting structural models may be selected and refined. We give a concrete flowchart for how to de- cide which modelling strategy is best suited in particular circumstances, and which steps need to be taken in each strategy. Notably, the ability to locate a suitable structural template by homology or fold recognition is crucial; without this models will be of low quality at best. With a template avail- able, the quality of the query-template alignment crucially determines the model quality. We also discuss how other, courser, experimental data may be incorporated in the modelling process to alleviate the problem of missing template structures. Finally, we discuss measures to predict the quality of models generated.
q-bio.BM:De novo prediction of protein folding is an open scientific challenge. Many folding models and force fields have been developed, yet all face difficulties converging to native conformations. Hydrophobicity scales (HSs) play a crucial role in such simulations as they define the energetic interactions between protein residues, thus determining the energetically favorable conformation. While many HSs have been developed over the years using various methods, it is surprising that the scales show very weak consensus in their assignment of hydrophobicity indexes to the various residues. In this work, several HSs are systematically assessed via atomistic Monte Carlo simulation of folding of small proteins, by converting the HSs of interest into residue-residue contact energy matrices. HSs that poorly preserve native structures of proteins were tuned by applying a linear transformation. Subsequently, folding simulations were used to examine the ability of the HSs to correctly fold the proteins from a random initial conformation. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) and energy of the proteins during folding were sampled and used to define an ER-score, as the correlation between the 2-dimensional energy-RMSD (ER) histogram with 50% lowest energy conformations and the ER histogram with 50% lowest RMSD conformations. Thus, we were able to compare the ability of the different HSs to predict de novo protein folding quantitatively.
q-bio.BM:Amyloid fibrils are stable aggregates of misfolded proteins and polypeptides that are insoluble and resistant to protease activity. Abnormal formation of amyloid fibrils in vivo may lead to neurodegenerative disorders and other systemic amyloidosis such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and atherosclerosis. Because of their clinical importance amyloids are found under intense scientific research. Amyloidogenic sequences of short polypeptide segments within proteins are responsible for the transformation of correctly folded proteins into parts of larger amyloid fibrils. The {\alpha}-helical secondary structure is believed to host many amyloidogenic sequences and be a key player in different stages of the amyloidogenesis process. Most of the studies on amyloids focus on the role of amyloidogenic sequences. The focus of this study is the relation between amyloidogenicity and the structure of the amyloidogenic {\alpha}-helical sequence. We have previously shown that the {\alpha}-helical conformation may be expressed by two parameters ({\theta} and \{rho}) that form orthogonal coordinates based on the Ramachandran dihedrals ({\phi} and {\psi}) and provide an illuminating interpretation of the {\alpha}-helical conformation. By performing statistical analysis on {\alpha}-helical conformations found in the protein data bank, an apparent relation between {\alpha}-helical conformation, as expressed by {\theta} and \{rho}, and amyloidogenicity is revealed. Remarkably, random amino acid sequences, whose helical structure was obtained from the most probably dihedral angles as obtained from PDB data, revealed the same dependency of amyloidogenicity, suggesting the importance of {\alpha}-helical structure as opposed to sequence.
q-bio.BM:Quantum calculations on the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of the Kv1.2 potassium channel (pdb: 3Lut)have been carried out on a 904 atoms subset of the VSD, plus 24 water molecules. Side chains pointing away from the center of the VSD were truncated; S1,S2,S3 end atoms were were fixed (all calculations); S4 end atoms could be fixed or free. Open conformations (membrane potentials >= 0) closely match the known X-ray structure of the open state with salt bridges in the in the VSD not ionized (H+ on the acid) whether S4 end atoms were fixed or free (slightly closer fixed than free).The S4 segment backbone, free or not, moves less than 2.5 A for positive to negative membrane potential switches, not entirely in the expected direction, leaving H+ motion as the principal component of the gating current. Groups of 3 - 5 side chains are important for proton transport, based on the calculations. A proton transfers from tyrosine (Y266), through arginine (R300), to glutamate (E183), accounting for approximately 20 - 25% of the gating charge. Clusters of amino acids that can transfer protons (acids, bases, tyrosine, histidine) are the main paths for proton transport. A group of five amino acids, bounded by the conserved aromatic F233, appears to exchange a proton. Dipole rotations may also contribute. A proton path (calculations still in progress) is proposed for the remainder of the VSD, suggesting a hypothesis for a complete gating mechanism.
q-bio.BM:The largely intrinsically disordered phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins (FG Nups) underline a selectivity mechanism, which enables the rapid translocation of transport factors (TFs) through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Conflicting models of NPC transport have assumed that FG Nups undergo different conformational transitions upon interacting with TFs. To selectively characterize conformational changes in FG Nups induced by TFs we performed small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast matching. Conformational ensembles derived SANS data indicate an increase in the overall size of FG Nups is associated with TF interaction. Moreover, the organization of the FG motif in the interacting state is consistent with prior experimental analyses defining that FG motifs undergo conformational restriction upon interacting with TFs. These results provide structural insights into a highly dynamic interaction and illustrate how functional disorder imparts rapid and selective FG Nup / TF interactions.
q-bio.BM:Allosteric transcription factors undergo binding events both at their inducer binding sites as well as at distinct DNA binding domains, and it is often difficult to disentangle the structural and functional consequences of these two classes of interactions. In this work, we compare the ability of two statistical mechanical models - the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) and the Koshland-N\'emethy-Filmer (KNF) models of protein conformational change - to characterize the multi-step activation mechanism of the broadly acting cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP). We first consider the allosteric transition resulting from cyclic-AMP binding to CRP, then analyze how CRP binds to its operator, and finally investigate the ability of CRP to activate gene expression. In light of these models, we examine data from a beautiful recent experiment that created a single-chain version of the CRP homodimer, thereby enabling each subunit to be mutated separately. Using this construct, six mutants were created using all possible combinations of the wild type subunit, a D53H mutant subunit, and an S62F mutant subunit. We demonstrate that both the MWC and KNF models can explain the behavior of all six mutants using a small, self-consistent set of parameters. In comparing the results, we find that the MWC model slightly outperforms the KNF model in the quality of its fits, but more importantly the parameters inferred by the MWC model are more in line with structural knowledge of CRP. In addition, we discuss how the conceptual framework developed here for CRP enables us to not merely analyze data retrospectively, but has the predictive power to determine how combinations of mutations will interact, how double mutants will behave, and how each construct would regulate gene expression.
q-bio.BM:Background. Protein dihedral angles provide a detailed description of protein local conformation. Predicted dihedral angles can be used to narrow down the conformational space of the whole polypeptide chain significantly, thus aiding protein tertiary structure prediction. However, direct angle prediction from sequence alone is challenging.   Method. In this study, we present a novel method to predict real-valued angles by combining clustering and deep learning. That is, we first generate certain clusters of angles (each assigned a label) and then apply a deep residual neural network to predict the label posterior probability. Finally, we output real-valued prediction by a mixture of the clusters with their predicted probabilities. At the same time, we also estimate the bound of the prediction errors at each residue from the predicted label probabilities.   Result. In this article, we present a novel method (named RaptorX-Angle) to predict real-valued angles by combining clustering and deep learning. Tested on a subset of PDB25 and the targets in the latest two Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP), our method outperforms the existing state-of-art method SPIDER2 in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Our result also shows approximately linear relationship between the real prediction errors and our estimated bounds. That is, the real prediction error can be well approximated by our estimated bounds.   Conclusions. Our study provides an alternative and more accurate prediction of dihedral angles, which may facilitate protein structure prediction and functional study.
q-bio.BM:Hyperpolarized 13C-MRI allows real time observation of metabolism in vivo. Imaging sequences have been developed to follow the metabolism of [1-13C] pyruvate and extract reaction kinetics, which can show tumour treatment response. We applied the fitting model and algorithm for the imaging data of mice tumour models and determined error estimates for the parameters of interest. Data was least-squares fitted onto a two-site exchange model in MATLAB, followed by statistic computation to assess model performance. Inference through the application of MCMC was also performed. The modelling and inference process extracted quantitative information satisfactorily and reproducibly, demonstrating metabolic activity and intratumour heterogeneity. Finally, novel fitting methods were evaluated and further recommendations were made.
q-bio.BM:The CryoEM single particle imaging method has recently received broad attention in the field of structural biology for determining the structures of biological molecules. The structures can be resolved to near-atomic resolutions after rending a large number of CryoEM images measuring molecules in different orientations. However, the factors for model resolution need to be further explored. Here, we provide a theoretical framework in conjunction with numerical simulations to gauge the influence of several key factors that are determinant in model resolution. We found that the number of measured projection images and the quality of each measurement (quantified using average signal-noise-ratio) can be combined to a single factor, which is dominant to the constructed model resolution. Furthermore, the intrinsic thermal motion of the molecules and the defocus levels of the electron microscope both have significant effects on the model resolution. These effects can be quantitatively summarized using an analytical formula that provides a theoretical guideline on structure resolutions for given experimental measurements.
q-bio.BM:Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that lacks effective treatment options. Anti-amyloid beta (ABeta) antibodies are the leading drug candidates to treat AD, but the results of clinical trials have been disappointing. Introducing rational mutations into anti-ABeta antibodies to increase their effectiveness is a way forward, but the path to take is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate the use of computational fragment-based docking and MMPBSA binding free energy calculations in the analysis of anti-ABeta antibodies for rational drug design efforts. Our fragment-based docking method successfully predicted the emergence of the common EFRH epitope, MD simulations coupled with MMPBSA binding free energy calculations were used to analyze scenarios described in prior studies, and we introduced rational mutations into PFA1 to improve its calculated binding affinity towards the pE3-ABeta3-8 form of ABeta. Two out of four proposed mutations stabilized binding. Our study demonstrates that a computational approach may lead to an improved drug candidate for AD in the future.
q-bio.BM:ATP synthases utilize a proton motive force to synthesize ATP. In reverse, these membrane-embedded enzymes can also hydrolyze ATP to pump protons over the membrane. To prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis, distinct control mechanisms exist for ATP synthases in bacteria, archaea, chloroplasts and mitochondria. Single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) demonstrated that the C-terminus of the rotary subunit epsilon in the Escherichia coli enzyme changes its conformation to block ATP hydrolysis. Previously we investigated the related conformational changes of subunit F of the A1AO-ATP synthase from the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei G\"o1. Here, we analyze the lifetimes of fluorescence donor and acceptor dyes to distinguish between smFRET signals for conformational changes and potential artefacts.
q-bio.BM:The computational prediction of a protein structure from its sequence generally relies on a method to assess the quality of protein models. Most assessment methods rank candidate models using heavily engineered structural features, defined as complex functions of the atomic coordinates. However, very few methods have attempted to learn these features directly from the data. We show that deep convolutional networks can be used to predict the ranking of model structures solely on the basis of their raw three-dimensional atomic densities, without any feature tuning. We develop a deep neural network that performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The network is trained on decoys from the CASP7 to CASP10 datasets and its performance is tested on the CASP11 dataset. On the CASP11 stage 2 dataset, it achieves a loss of 0.064, whereas the best performing method achieves a loss of 0.063. Additional testing on decoys from the CASP12, CAMEO, and 3DRobot datasets confirms that the network performs consistently well across a variety of protein structures. While the network learns to assess structural decoys globally and does not rely on any predefined features, it can be analyzed to show that it implicitly identifies regions that deviate from the native structure.
q-bio.BM:DNA and protein microarrays are a high-throughput technology that allow the simultaneous quantification of tens of thousands of different biomolecular species. The mediocre sensitivity and dynamic range of traditional fluorescence microarrays compared to other techniques have been the technology's Achilles' Heel, and prevented their adoption for many biomedical and clinical diagnostic applications. Previous work to enhance the sensitivity of microarray readout to the single-molecule ('digital') regime have either required signal amplifying chemistry or sacrificed throughput, nixing the platform's primary advantages. Here, we report the development of a digital microarray which extends both the sensitivity and dynamic range of microarrays by about three orders of magnitude. This technique uses functionalized gold nanorods as single-molecule labels and an interferometric scanner which can rapidly enumerate individual nanorods by imaging them with a 10x objective lens. This approach does not require any chemical enhancement such as silver deposition, and scans arrays with a throughput similar to commercial fluorescence devices. By combining single-nanoparticle enumeration and ensemble measurements of spots when the particles are very dense, this system achieves a dynamic range of about one million directly from a single scan.
q-bio.BM:Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is important for signaling in the brain and the gut. Its agonist ligand neurotensin (NTS), a 13-amino-acid peptide, binds with nanomolar affinity from the extracellular side to NTSR1 and induces conformational changes that trigger intracellular signaling processes. Our goal is to monitor the conformational dynamics of single fluorescently labeled NTSR1. For this, we fused the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen to the C terminus of NTSR1, purified the receptor fusion protein from E. coli membranes, and reconstituted NTSR1 into liposomes with E. coli polar lipids. Using single-molecule anisotropy measurements, NTSR1 was found to be monomeric in liposomes, with a small fraction being dimeric and oligomeric, showing homoFRET. Similar results were obtained for NTSR1 in detergent solution. Furthermore, we demonstrated agonist binding to NTSR1 by time-resolved single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), using neurotensin labeled with the fluorophore ATTO594.
q-bio.BM:While many good textbooks are available on Protein Structure, Molecular Simulations, Thermodynamics and Bioinformatics methods in general, there is no good introductory level book for the field of Structural Bioinformatics. This book aims to give an introduction into Structural Bioinformatics, which is where the previous topics meet to explore three dimensional protein structures through computational analysis. We provide an overview of existing computational techniques, to validate, simulate, predict and analyse protein structures. More importantly, it will aim to provide practical knowledge about how and when to use such techniques. We will consider proteins from three major vantage points: Protein structure quantification, Protein structure prediction, and Protein simulation & dynamics.
q-bio.BM:Organization and maintenance of the chromosomal DNA in living cells strongly depends on the DNA interactions with a plethora of DNA-binding proteins. Single-molecule studies show that formation of nucleoprotein complexes on DNA by such proteins is frequently subject to force and torque constraints applied to the DNA. Although the existing experimental techniques allow to exert these type of mechanical constraints on individual DNA biopolymers, their exact effects in regulation of DNA-protein interactions are still not completely understood due to the lack of systematic theoretical methods able to efficiently interpret complex experimental observations. To fill this gap, we have developed a general theoretical framework based on the transfer-matrix calculations that can be used to accurately describe behaviour of DNA-protein interactions under force and torque constraints. Potential applications of the constructed theoretical approach are demonstrated by predicting how these constraints affect the DNA-binding properties of different types of architectural proteins. Obtained results provide important insights into potential physiological functions of mechanical forces in the chromosomal DNA organization by architectural proteins as well as into single-DNA manipulation studies of DNA-protein interactions.
q-bio.BM:Motivated by the problem of domain formation in chromosomes, we studied a co--polymer model where only a subset of the monomers feel attractive interactions. These monomers are displaced randomly from a regularly-spaced pattern, thus introducing some quenched disorder in the system. Previous work has shown that in the case of regularly-spaced interacting monomers this chain can fold into structures characterized by multiple distinct domains of consecutive segments. In each domain, attractive interactions are balanced by the entropy cost of forming loops. We show by advanced replica-exchange simulations that adding disorder in the position of the interacting monomers further stabilizes these domains. The model suggests that the partitioning of the chain into well-defined domains of consecutive monomers is a spontaneous property of heteropolymers. In the case of chromosomes, evolution could have acted on the spacing of interacting monomers to modulate in a simple way the underlying domains for functional reasons.
q-bio.BM:Classical simulations of protein flexibility remain computationally expensive, especially for large proteins. A few years ago, we developed a fast method for predicting protein structure fluctuations that uses a single protein model as the input. The method has been made available as the CABS-flex web server and applied in numerous studies of protein structure-function relationships. Here, we present a major update of the CABS-flex web server to version 2.0. The new features include: extension of the method to significantly larger and multimeric proteins, customizable distance restraints and simulation parameters, contact maps and a new, enhanced web server interface. CABS-flex 2.0 is freely available at http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSflex2
q-bio.BM:Pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics due to their ability in creating an envelope on the outer layer of lipooligosaccharides (LOS). The cationic phosphoethanolamine (PEA) decoration of LOS lipid A is regulated by lipid A-PEA transferase (EptA) which may serve as a prominent target for developing new antibiotics. The structural characterization of Neisserial EptA has provided a structural basis to its catalytic mechanisms and ligand recognition that are crucial for inhibitor development. In this study, a combination of pharmacophore- and ligand-based approach has been employed to explore novel potent EptA inhibitors among millions of commercially-available compounds and approved drugs. A total of 8166 hit molecules obtained from ZincPharmer pharmacophore-based screening and PubMed ligand similarity search were further examined through individual two-step semi-flexible docking simulation performed in MOE. Best hits were therefore selected based on their docking score and consensus of the two docking validations. Free energy of binding calculation suggests that the best 20 consensus compounds have a stronger binding affinity than EptA natural substrate PEA. Further interaction analyses of selected eight ligands demonstrate that these ligands have overall more effective interactions with catalytically-essential residues and metal cofactors of EptA. Selected hits can be further analyzed in vitro and examined through a pre-clinical trial. This study provides an insight into drug repurposing which may serve as an initial step to develop novel potent EptA inhibitors to combat the virulence of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
q-bio.BM:The recent rise of cryo-EM and X-ray high-throughput techniques is providing a wealth of new structures trapped in different conformations. Understanding how proteins transition between different conformers, and how they relate to each other in terms of function is not straightforward, and highly depends on the choice of the right set of degrees of freedom. Here we present eBDIMS server, an online tool and software for automatic classification of structural ensembles and reconstruction of transition pathways using coarse-grained (CG) simulations. The server generates CG-pathways between two protein conformations along with a representation in a simplified 2D-motion landscape based on the Principal Components (PCs) from experimental structures. For a conformationally rich ensemble, the PCs provide powerful reaction coordinates for automatic structure classification, detection of on-pathway intermediates and validation of in silico pathways. When the number of available structures is low or sampling is limited, Normal Modes (NMs) provide alternative motion axes for trajectory analysis. The path-generation eBDIMS method is available at a user-friendly website: https://login.biophysics.kth.se/eBDIMS/ or as standalone software. The server incorporates a powerful interactive graphical interface for simultaneous visualization of transition pathways in 2D-motion space and 3D-molecular graphics, which greatly facilitates the exploration of the relationships between different conformations.
q-bio.BM:The folding dynamics of proteins at the single molecule level has been studied with single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments for twenty years, but a common standardized method for the analysis of the collected data and for the sharing among the scientific community members is still not available. We have developed a new open source tool, Fodis, for the analysis of the Force-distance curves obtained in SMFS experiments, providing an almost automatic processing, analysis and classification of the obtained data. Our method provides also a classification of the possible unfolding pathways and structural heterogeneity, present during the unfolding of proteins.
q-bio.BM:MOTIVATION: Proteins fold into complex structures that are crucial for their biological functions. Experimental determination of protein structures is costly and therefore limited to a small fraction of all known proteins. Hence, different computational structure prediction methods are necessary for the modelling of the vast majority of all proteins. In most structure prediction pipelines, the last step is to select the best available model and to estimate its accuracy. This model quality estimation problem has been growing in importance during the last decade, and progress is believed to be important for large scale modelling of proteins. The current generation of model quality estimation programs performs well at separating incorrect and good models, but fails to consistently identify the best possible model. State-of-the-art model quality assessment methods use a combination of features that describe a model and the agreement of the model with features predicted from the protein sequence.   RESULTS: We first introduce a deep neural network architecture to predict model quality using significantly fewer input features than state-of-the-art methods. Thereafter, we propose a methodology to train the deep network that leverages the comparative structure of the problem. We also show the possibility of applying transfer learning on databases of known protein structures. We demonstrate its viability by reaching state-of-the-art performance using only a reduced set of input features and a coarse description of the models.

q-bio.BM:Advanced mathematics, such as multiscale weighted colored graph and element specific persistent homology, and machine learning including deep neural networks were integrated to construct mathematical deep learning models for pose and binding affinity prediction and ranking in the last two D3R grand challenges in computer-aided drug design and discovery. D3R Grand Challenge 2 (GC2) focused on the pose prediction and binding affinity ranking and free energy prediction for Farnesoid X receptor ligands. Our models obtained the top place in absolute free energy prediction for free energy Set 1 in Stage 2. The latest competition, D3R Grand Challenge 3 (GC3), is considered as the most difficult challenge so far. It has 5 subchallenges involving Cathepsin S and five other kinase targets, namely VEGFR2, JAK2, p38-$\alpha$, TIE2, and ABL1. There is a total of 26 official competitive tasks for GC3. Our predictions were ranked 1st in 10 out of 26 official competitive tasks.
q-bio.BM:Interest in equilibrium-based sampling methods has grown with recent advances in computational hardware and Markov state modeling (MSM) methods, yet outstanding questions remain that hinder widespread adoption. Namely, how do sampling strategies explore conformational space and how might this influence predictions? Here, we seek to answer these questions for four commonly used sampling methods: 1) a long simulation, 2) many short simulations, 3) adaptive sampling, and 4) FAST. We first develop a theoretical framework for analytically calculating the probability of discovering states and uncover the drastic effects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes to characterize state discovery and transition pathways. Consistently, we find that FAST simulations discover target states with the highest probability and traverse realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the pathology that short parallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by crossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically circumnavigate, which we refer to as pathway tunneling. To protect against tunneling, we introduce FAST-string, which samples along the highest-flux transition paths to refine an MSMs transition probabilities and discriminate between competing pathways. Additionally, we compare MSM estimators in describing thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend normalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding pseudo-counts to avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate our insights from simple landscapes with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of the {\lambda}-repressor protein. We find that FAST-contacts predicts the same folding pathway as long simulations but with orders of magnitude less simulation time.
q-bio.BM:Experiments measuring currents through single protein channels show unstable currents, a phenomena called the gating of a single channel. Channels switch between an 'open' state with a well defined single amplitude of current and 'closed' states with nearly zero current. The existing mean-field theory of ion channels focuses almost solely on the open state. The physical modeling of the dynamical features of ion channels is still in its infancy, and does not describe the transitions between open and closed states, nor the distribution of the duration times of open states. One hypothesis is that gating corresponds to noise-induced fast transitions between multiple steady (equilibrium) states of the underlying system. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis. Particularly, our study focuses on the (high order) steric Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Cahn-Hilliard model since it has been successful in predicting permeability and selectivity of ionic channels in their open state, and since it gives rise to multiple steady states. We show that this system gives rise to a gating-like behavior, but that important features of this switching behavior are different from the defining features of gating in biological systems. Furthermore, we show that noise prohibits switching in the system of study. The above phenomena are expected to occur in other PNP-type models, strongly suggesting that one has to go beyond over-damped (gradient flow) Nernst-Planck type dynamics to explain the spontaneous gating of single channels.
q-bio.BM:Proteins employ the information stored in the genetic code and translated into their sequences to carry out well-defined functions in the cellular environment. The possibility to encode for such functions is controlled by the balance between the amount of information supplied by the sequence and that left after that the protein has folded into its structure. We developed a computational algorithm to evaluate the amount of information necessary to specify the protein structure, keeping into account the thermodynamic properties of protein folding. We thus show that the information remaining in the protein sequence after encoding for its structure (the 'information gap') is very close to what needed to encode for its function and interactions. Then, by predicting the information gap directly from the protein sequence, we show that it may be possible to use these insights from information theory to discriminate between ordered and disordered proteins, to identify unknown functions, and to optimize designed proteins sequences.
q-bio.BM:The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains more than 135 000 entries today. From these, relatively few amyloid structures can be identified, since amyloids are insoluble in water. Therefore, mostly solid state NMR-recorded amyloid structures are deposited in the PDB. Based on the geometric analysis of these deposited structures we have prepared an automatically updated webserver, which generates the list of the deposited amyloid structures, and, additionally, those globular protein entries, which have amyloid-like substructures of a given size and characteristics. We have found that applying only the properly chosen geometric conditions, it is possible to identify the deposited amyloid structures, and a number of globular proteins with amyloid-like substructures. We have analyzed these globular proteins and have found that many of them are known to form amyloids more easily than many other globular proteins. Our results relate to the method of (Stankovic, I. et al. (2017): Construction of Amyloid PDB Files Database. Transactions on Internet Research. 13 (1): 47-51), who have applied a hybrid textual-search and geometric approach for finding amyloids in the PDB.   If one intends to identify a subset of the PDB for some applications, the identification algorithm needs to be re-run periodically, since in 2017, on average, every day 30 new entries were deposited in the data bank. Our webserver is updated regularly and automatically, and the identified amyloid- and partial amyloid structures can be viewed or their list can be downloaded from the site https://pitgroup.org/amyloid.
q-bio.BM:Eicosanoids and related species are critical, small bioactive mediators of human physiology and inflammation. While ~1100 distinct eicosanoids have been predicted to exist, to date, less than 150 of these molecules have been measured in humans, limiting our understanding of eicosanoids and their role in human biology. Using a directed non-targeted mass spectrometry approach in conjunction with computational chemical networking of spectral fragmentation patterns, we find over 500 discrete chemical signals highly consistent with known and putative eicosanoids in human plasma, including 46 putative novel molecules not previously described, thereby greatly expanding the breath of prior analytical strategies. In plasma samples from 1500 individuals, we find members of this expanded eicosanoid library hold close association with markers of inflammation, as well as clinical characteristics linked with inflammation, including advancing age and obesity. These experimental and computational approaches enable discovery of new chemical entities and will shed important insight into the role of bioactive molecules in human disease.
q-bio.BM:Membrane transporters contribute to the regulation of the internal environment of cells by translocating substrates across cell membranes. Like all physical systems, the behaviour of membrane transporters is constrained by the laws of thermodynamics. However, many mathematical models of transporters, especially those incorporated into whole-cell models, are not thermodynamically consistent, leading to unrealistic behaviour. In this paper we use a physics-based modelling framework, in which the transfer of energy is explicitly accounted for, to develop thermodynamically consistent models of transporters. We then apply this methodology to model two specific transporters: the cardiac sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ ATPase (SERCA) and the cardiac Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase.
q-bio.BM:In the present work, we review the fundamental methods which have been developed in the last few years for classifying into families and clans the distribution of amino acids in protein databases. This is done through functions of random variables, the Entropy Measures of probabilities of occurrence of the amino acids. An intensive study of the Pfam databases is presented with restrictions to families which could be represented by rectangular arrays of amino acids with m rows (protein domains) and n columns (amino acids). This work is also an invitation to scientific research groups worldwide to undertake the statistical analysis with different numbers of rows and columns since we believe in the mathematical characterization of the distribution of amino acids as a fundamental insight on the determination of protein structure and evolution.
q-bio.BM:A central goal of protein-folding theory is to predict the stochastic dynamics of transition paths --- the rare trajectories that transit between the folded and unfolded ensembles --- using only thermodynamic information, such as a low-dimensional equilibrium free-energy landscape. However, commonly used one-dimensional landscapes typically fall short of this aim, because an empirical coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient has to be fit to transition-path trajectory data in order to reproduce the transition-path dynamics. We show that an alternative, first-principles free-energy landscape predicts transition-path statistics that agree well with simulations and single-molecule experiments without requiring dynamical data as an input. This 'topological configuration' model assumes that distinct, native-like substructures assemble on a timescale that is slower than native-contact formation but faster than the folding of the entire protein. Using only equilibrium simulation data to determine the free energies of these coarse-grained intermediate states, we predict a broad distribution of transition-path transit times that agrees well with the transition-path durations observed in simulations. We further show that both the distribution of finite-time displacements on a one-dimensional order parameter and the ensemble of transition-path trajectories generated by the model are consistent with the simulated transition paths. These results indicate that a landscape based on transient folding intermediates, which are often hidden by one-dimensional projections, can form the basis of a predictive model of protein-folding transition-path dynamics.
q-bio.BM:Markov State Models (MSMs) are a powerful framework to reproduce the long-time conformational dynamics of biomolecules using a set of short Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. However, precise kinetics predictions of MSMs heavily rely on the features selected to describe the system. Despite the importance of feature selection for large system, determining an optimal set of features remains a difficult unsolved problem. Here, we introduce an automatic approach to optimize feature selection based on genetic algorithms (GA), which adaptively evolves the most fitted solution according to natural selection laws. The power of the GA-based method is illustrated on long atomistic folding simulations of four proteins, varying in length from 28 to 80 residues. Due to the diversity of tested proteins, we expect that our method will be extensible to other proteins and drive MSM building to a more objective protocol.
q-bio.BM:The design of novel proteins has many applications but remains an attritional process with success in isolated cases. Meanwhile, deep learning technologies have exploded in popularity in recent years and are increasingly applicable to biology due to the rise in available data. We attempt to link protein design and deep learning by using variational autoencoders to generate protein sequences conditioned on desired properties. Potential copper and calcium binding sites are added to non-metal binding proteins without human intervention and compared to a hidden Markov model. In another use case, a grammar of protein structures is developed and used to produce sequences for a novel protein topology. One candidate structure is found to be stable by molecular dynamics simulation. The ability of our model to confine the vast search space of protein sequences and to scale easily has the potential to assist in a variety of protein design tasks.
q-bio.BM:The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains the atomic structures of over 105 biomolecules with better than 2.8A resolution. The listing of the identities and coordinates of the atoms comprising each macromolecule permits an analysis of the slow-time vibrational response of these large systems to minor perturbations. 3D video animations of individual modes of oscillation demonstrate how regions interdigitate to create cohesive collective motions, providing a comprehensive framework for and familiarity with the overall 3D architecture. Furthermore, the isolation and representation of the softest, slowest deformation coordinates provide opportunities for the development of me- chanical models of enzyme function. The eigenvector decomposition, therefore, must be accurate, reliable as well as rapid to be generally reported upon. We obtain the eigenmodes of a 1.2A 34kDa PDB entry using either exclusively heavy atoms or partly or fully reduced atomic sets; Cartesian or internal coordinates; interatomic force fields derived either from a full Cartesian potential, a reduced atomic potential or a Gaussian distance-dependent potential; and independently devel- oped software. These varied technologies are similar in that each maintains proper stereochemistry either by use of dihedral degrees of freedom which freezes bond lengths and bond angles, or by use of a full atomic potential that includes realistic bond length and angle restraints. We find that the shapes of the slowest eigenvectors are nearly identical, not merely similar.
q-bio.BM:Let Sn denote the network of all RNA secondary structures of length n, in which undirected edges exist between structures s, t such that t is obtained from s by the addition, removal or shift of a single base pair. Using context-free grammars, generating functions and complex analysis, we show that the asymptotic average degree is O(n) and that the asymptotic clustering coeffcient is O(1/n), from which it follows that the family Sn, n = 1,2,3,... of secondary structure networks is not small-world.
q-bio.BM:We construct a one-bead-per-residue coarse-grained dynamical model to describe intrinsically disordered proteins at significantly longer timescales than in the all-atom models. In this model, inter-residue contacts form and disappear during the course of the time evolution. The contacts may arise between the sidechains, the backbones or the sidechains and backbones of the interacting residues. The model yields results that are consistent with many all-atom and experimental data on these systems. We demonstrate that the geometrical properties of various homopeptides differ substantially in this model. In particular, the average radius of gyration scales with the sequence length in a residue-dependent manner.
q-bio.BM:All known terrestrial proteins are coded as continuous strings of ~20 amino acids. The patterns formed by the repetitions of elements in groups of finite sequences describes the natural architectures of protein families. We present a method to search for patterns and groupings of patterns in protein sequences using a mathematically precise definition for 'repetition', an efficient algorithmic implementation and a robust scoring system with no adjustable parameters. We show that the sequence patterns can be well-separated into disjoint classes according to their recurrence in nested structures. The statistics of pattern occurrences indicate that short repetitions are enough to account for the differences between natural families and randomized groups by more than 10 standard deviations, while patterns shorter than 5 residues are effectively random. A small subset of patterns is sufficient to account for a robust ''familiarity'' definition of arbitrary sets of sequences.
q-bio.BM:Protein-peptide interactions play essential roles in many cellular processes and their structural characterization is the major focus of current experimental and theoretical research. Two decades ago, it was proposed to employ the steered molecular dynamics to assess the strength of protein-peptide interactions. The idea behind using steered molecular dynamics simulations is that the mechanical stability can be used as a promising and an efficient alternative to computationally highly demanding estimation of binding affinity. However, mechanical stability defined as a peak in force-extension profile depends on the choice of the pulling direction. Here we propose an uncommon choice of the pulling direction along resultant dipole moment vector, which has not been explored in simulations so far. Using explicit solvent all-atom MD simulations, we apply steered molecular dynamics technique to probe mechanical resistance of protein-peptide system pulled along two different vectors. A novel pulling direction, along the resultant dipole moment vector, results in stronger forces compared to commonly used peptide unbinding along center of masses vector. Our results demonstrate that resultant dipole moment is one of the factors influencing the mechanical stability of protein-peptide complex.
q-bio.BM:Beta-turn prediction is useful in protein function studies and experimental design. Although recent approaches using machine-learning techniques such as SVM, neural networks, and K-NN have achieved good results for beta-turn pre-diction, there is still significant room for improvement. As previous predictors utilized features in a sliding window of 4-20 residues to capture interactions among sequentially neighboring residues, such feature engineering may result in incomplete or biased features, and neglect interactions among long-range residues. Deep neural networks provide a new opportunity to address these issues. Here, we proposed a deep dense inception network (DeepDIN) for beta-turn prediction, which takes advantages of the state-of-the-art deep neural network design of the DenseNet and the inception network. A test on a recent BT6376 benchmark shows that the DeepDIN outperformed the previous best BetaTPred3 significantly in both the overall prediction accuracy and the nine-type beta-turn classification. A tool, called MUFold-BetaTurn, was developed, which is the first beta-turn prediction tool utilizing deep neural networks. The tool can be downloaded at http://dslsrv8.cs.missouri.edu/~cf797/MUFoldBetaTurn/download.html.
q-bio.BM:Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR{\gamma}) are ligand-activated controllers of various metabolic actions and insulin sensitivity. PPAR{\gamma} is thus considered as an important target to treat type 2 diabetes. Available PPAR{\gamma} drugs (full agonists) have robust insulin-sensitizing properties but are accompanied by severe side effects leading to complicated health problems. Here, we have used molecular docking and a molecular dynamics simulation study to find a novel PPAR{\gamma} ligand from a natural product. Our study suggests that the inhibition of ceramicine B in the PPAR{\gamma} ligand-binding domain (LBD) could act as a partial agonist and block cdk5-mediated phosphorylation. This result may provide an opportunity for the development of new anti-diabetic drugs by targeting PPAR{\gamma} while avoiding the side effects associated with full agonists.
q-bio.BM:Auxin is considered one of the cardinal hormones in plant growth and development. It regulates a wide range of processes throughout the plant. Synthetic auxins exploit the auxin-signalling pathway and are valuable as herbicidal agrochemicals. Currently, despite a diversity of chemical scaffolds all synthetic auxins have a carboxylic acid as the active core group. By applying bio-isosteric replacement we discovered that indole-3-tetrazole was active by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry, showing that the tetrazole could initiate assembly of the TIR1 auxin co-receptor complex. We then tested the tetrazole's efficacy in a range of whole plant physiological assays and in protoplast reporter assays which all confirmed auxin activity, albeit rather weak. We then tested indole-3-tetrazole against the AFB5 homologue of TIR1, finding that binding was selective against TIR1, absent with AFB5. The kinetics of binding to TIR1 are contrasted to those for the herbicide picloram, which shows the opposite receptor preference as it binds to AFB5 with far greater affinity than to TIR1. The basis of the preference of indole-3-tetrazole for TIR1 was revealed to be a single residue substitution using molecular docking, and assays using tir1 and afb5 mutant lines confirmed selectivity in vivo. Given the potential that a TIR1-selective auxin might have for unmasking receptor-specific actions, we followed a rational design, lead optimisation campaign and a set of chlorinated indole-3-tetrazoles was synthesised. Improved affinity for TIR1 and the preference for binding to TIR1 was maintained for 4- and 6-chloroindole-3-tetrazoles, coupled with improved efficacy in vivo. This work expands the range of auxin chemistry for the design of receptor-selective synthetic auxins.
q-bio.BM:We present a new method that combines alchemical transformation with physical pathway to accurately and efficiently compute the absolute binding free energy of receptor-ligand complex. Currently, the double decoupling method (DDM) and the potential of mean force approach (PMF) methods are widely used to compute the absolute binding free energy of biomolecules. The DDM relies on alchemically decoupling the ligand from its environments, which can be computationally challenging for large ligands and charged ligands because of the large magnitude of the decoupling free energies involved. On the other hand, the PMF approach uses physical pathway to extract the ligand out of the binding site, thus avoids the alchemical decoupling of the ligand. However, the PMF method has its own drawback because of the reliance on a ligand binding/unbinding pathway free of steric obstruction from the receptor atoms. Therefore, in the presence of deeply buried ligand functional groups the convergence of the PMF calculation can be very slow leading to large errors in the computed binding free energy. Here we develop a new method called AlchemPMF by combining alchemical transformation with physical pathway to overcome the major drawback in the PMF method. We have tested the new approach on the binding of a charged ligand to an allosteric site on HIV-1 Integrase. After 20 ns of simulation per umbrella sampling window, the new method yields absolute binding free energies within ~1 kcal/mol from the experimental result, whereas the standard PMF approach and the DDM calculations result in errors of ~5 kcal/mol and > 2 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, the binding free energy computed using the new method is associated with smaller statistical error compared with those obtained from the existing methods.
q-bio.BM:Hydrogen bonding between nucleobases produces diverse DNA structural motifs, including canonical duplexes, guanine (G) quadruplexes and cytosine (C) i-motifs. Incorporating metal-mediated base pairs into nucleic acid structures can introduce new functionalities and enhanced stabilities. Here we demonstrate, using mass spectrometry (MS), ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), that parallel-stranded structures consisting of up to 20 G-Ag(I)-G contiguous base pairs are formed when natural DNA sequences are mixed with silver cations in aqueous solution. FRET indicates that duplexes formed by poly(cytosine) strands with 20 contiguous C-Ag(I)-C base pairs are also parallel. Silver-mediated G-duplexes form preferentially over G-quadruplexes, and the ability of Ag+ to convert G-quadruplexes into silver-paired duplexes may provide a new route to manipulating these biologically relevant structures. IMS indicates that G-duplexes are linear and more rigid than B-DNA. DFT calculations were used to propose structures compatible with the IMS experiments. Such inexpensive, defect-free and soluble DNA-based nanowires open new directions in the design of novel metal-mediated DNA nanotechnology.
q-bio.BM:Due to the low density of envelope (Env) spikes on the surface of HIV-1, neutralizing IgG antibodies rarely bind bivalently using both antigen-binding arms (Fabs) to crosslink between spikes (inter-spike crosslinking), instead resorting to weaker monovalent binding that is more sensitive to Env mutations. Synthetic antibodies designed to bivalently bind a single Env trimer (intra-spike crosslinking) were previously shown to exhibit increased neutralization potencies. In initial work, diFabs joined by varying lengths of rigid double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were considered. Anticipating future experiments to improve synthetic antibodies, we investigate whether linkers with different rigidities could enhance diFab potency by modeling DNA-Fabs containing different combinations of rigid dsDNA and flexible single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and characterizing their neutralization potential. Model predictions suggest that while a long flexible polymer may be capable of bivalent binding, it exhibits weak neutralization due to the large loss in entropic degrees of freedom when both Fabs are bound. In contrast, the strongest neutralization potencies are predicted to require a rigid linker that optimally spans the distance between two Fab binding sites on an Env trimer, and avidity can be further boosted by incorporating more Fabs into these constructs. These results inform the design of multivalent anti-HIV-1 therapeutics that utilize avidity effects to remain potent against HIV-1 in the face of the rapid mutation of Env spikes.
q-bio.BM:Accurate prediction of protein stability changes upon single-site variations (DDG) is important for protein design, as well as our understanding of the mechanism of genetic diseases. The performance of high-throughput computational methods to this end is evaluated mostly based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and observed data, assuming that the upper bound would be 1 (perfect correlation). However, the performance of these predictors can be limited by the distribution and noise of the experimental data. Here we estimate, for the first time, a theoretical upper-bound to the DDG prediction performances imposed by the intrinsic structure of currently available DDG data. Given a set of measured DDG protein variations, the theoretically best predictor is estimated based on its similarity to another set of experimentally determined DDG values. We investigate the correlation between pairs of measured DDG variations, where one is used as a predictor for the other. We analytically derive an upper bound to the Pearson correlation as a function of the noise and distribution of the DDG data. We also evaluate the available datasets to highlight the effect of the noise in conjunction with DDG distribution. We conclude that the upper bound is a function of both uncertainty and spread of the DDG values, and that with current data the best performance should be between 0.7-0.8, depending on the dataset used; higher Pearson correlations might be indicative of overtraining. It also follows that comparisons of predictors using different datasets are inherently misleading.
q-bio.BM:In this study, we introduced a new unit, named "protein token", as a dynamic protein structural unit for protein-protein interactions. Unlike the conventional structural units, protein token is not based on the sequential or spatial arrangement of residues, but comprises remote residues involved in cooperative conformational changes during protein interactions. Application of protein token on Ras GTPases revealed various tokens present in the superfamily. Distinct token combinations were found in H-Ras interacting with its various regulators and effectors, directing to a possible clue for the multiplexer property of Ras superfamily. Thus, this protein token theory may provide a new approach to study protein-protein interactions in broad applications.
q-bio.BM:Biorefinery sector has become a serious dispute for cleaner and sustainable development in recent years. In the present study, pretreatment of pineapple peel waste was carried out in high pressure reactor using various pretreatment-enhancers. The type and concentration effect of each enhancer on hemicellulose solubilization was systematically investigated. The binary acid (phenol + sulfuric acid) at 180 {\deg}C was found to be superior amongst other studied enhancers, giving 81.17% (w/v) hemicellulose solubilization in liquid-fraction under optimized conditions. Solid residue thus obtained was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis that resulted into 24.50% (w/v) cellulose breakdown. Treated solid residue was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to elucidate structural changes. The pooled fractions (acid treated and enzymatically hydrolyzed) were fermented using Clostridium acetobutylicum NRRL B 527 which resulted in butanol production of 5.18 g/L with yield of 0.13 g butanol/g sugar consumed. Therefore, pretreatment of pineapple peel waste evaluated in this study can be considered as milestone in utilization of low cost feedstock, for bioenergy production.
q-bio.BM:We consider self-assembly of proteins into a virus capsid by the methods of molecular dynamics. The capsid corresponds either to SPMV or CCMV and is studied with and without the RNA molecule inside. The proteins are flexible and described by the structure-based coarse-grained model augmented by electrostatic interactions. Previous studies of the capsid self-assembly involved solid objects of a supramolecular scale, e.g. corresponding to capsomeres, with engineered couplings and stochastic movements. In our approach, a single capsid is dissociated by an application of a high temperature for a variable period and then the system is cooled down to allow for self-assembly. The restoration of the capsid proceeds to various extent, depending on the nature of the dissociated state, but is rarely complete because some proteins depart too far unless the process takes place in a confined space.
q-bio.BM:Contact-assisted protein folding has made very good progress, but two challenges remain. One is accurate contact prediction for proteins lack of many sequence homologs and the other is that time-consuming folding simulation is often needed to predict good 3D models from predicted contacts. We show that protein distance matrix can be predicted well by deep learning and then directly used to construct 3D models without folding simulation at all. Using distance geometry to construct 3D models from our predicted distance matrices, we successfully folded 21 of the 37 CASP12 hard targets with a median family size of 58 effective sequence homologs within 4 hours on a Linux computer of 20 CPUs. In contrast, contacts predicted by direct coupling analysis (DCA) cannot fold any of them in the absence of folding simulation and the best CASP12 group folded 11 of them by integrating predicted contacts into complex, fragment-based folding simulation. The rigorous experimental validation on 15 CASP13 targets show that among the 3 hardest targets of new fold our distance-based folding servers successfully folded 2 large ones with <150 sequence homologs while the other servers failed on all three, and that our ab initio folding server also predicted the best, high-quality 3D model for a large homology modeling target. Further experimental validation in CAMEO shows that our ab initio folding server predicted correct fold for a membrane protein of new fold with 200 residues and 229 sequence homologs while all the other servers failed. These results imply that deep learning offers an efficient and accurate solution for ab initio folding on a personal computer.
q-bio.BM:Prediction of metabolism in cytochrome P450s remains to be a crucial yet challenging topic in discovering and designing drugs, agrochemicals and nutritional supplements. The problem is challenging because the rate of P450 metabolism depends upon both the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the site and the protein-ligand geometry that is energetically accessible in the active site of a given P450 isozyme. We have addressed this problem using a two-level screening system. The first level implements an empirical QSAR-based scoring function employing the local chemical motifs to characterize the intrinsic reactivity. The second level uses molecular docking and molecular mechanics to account for the geometrical effects, including induced-fit effects in the protein which can be very important in P450 interactions with ligands. This approach has achieved high accuracy for both the P450 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms. In identifying at least one metabolic site in the top two ranked positions, the prediction rate can reach as high as 92.7% for the test set of isoform 3A4. For the 2D6 isoform, 100% accuracy is achieved on this basic evaluation metric, and, because this active site is considerably smaller and more selective than 3A4, very high precision is attained for full prediction of all metabolic sites. The method also requires considerably less CPU time than our previous efforts, which involved a large number of expensive simulations for each ligand to be evaluated. After screening using the empirical score function, only a few best candidates are left for each ligand, making the number of necessary estimations in the second level very small, which significantly reduces the computation time.
q-bio.BM:Machine learning (ML)-guided directed evolution is a new paradigm for biological design that enables optimization of complex functions. ML methods use data to predict how sequence maps to function without requiring a detailed model of the underlying physics or biological pathways. To demonstrate ML-guided directed evolution, we introduce the steps required to build ML sequence-function models and use them to guide engineering, making recommendations at each stage. This review covers basic concepts relevant to using ML for protein engineering as well as the current literature and applications of this new engineering paradigm. ML methods accelerate directed evolution by learning from information contained in all measured variants and using that information to select sequences that are likely to be improved. We then provide two case studies that demonstrate the ML-guided directed evolution process. We also look to future opportunities where ML will enable discovery of new protein functions and uncover the relationship between protein sequence and function.
q-bio.BM:The inapplicability of amino acid covariation methods to small protein families has limited their use for structural annotation of whole genomes. Recently, deep learning has shown promise in allowing accurate residue-residue contact prediction even for shallow sequence alignments. Here we introduce DMPfold, which uses deep learning to predict inter-atomic distance bounds, the main chain hydrogen bond network, and torsion angles, which it uses to build models in an iterative fashion. DMPfold produces more accurate models than two popular methods for a test set of CASP12 domains, and works just as well for transmembrane proteins. Applied to all Pfam domains without known structures, confident models for 25% of these so-called dark families were produced in under a week on a small 200 core cluster. DMPfold provides models for 16% of human proteome UniProt entries without structures, generates accurate models with fewer than 100 sequences in some cases, and is freely available.
q-bio.BM:Proteins display generic properties that are challenging to explain by direct selection, notably allostery, the capacity to be regulated through long-range effects, and evolvability, the capacity to adapt to new selective pressures. An evolutionary scenario is proposed where proteins acquire these two features indirectly as a by-product of their selection for a more fundamental property, exquisite discrimination, the capacity to bind discriminatively very similar ligands. Achieving this task is shown to typically require proteins to undergo a conformational change. We argue that physical and evolutionary constraints impel this change to be controlled by a group of sites extending from the binding site. Proteins can thus acquire a latent potential for allosteric regulation and evolutionary adaptation because of long-range effects that initially arise as evolutionary spandrels. This scenario accounts for the groups of conserved and coevolving residues observed in multiple sequence alignments. However, we propose that most pairs of coevolving and contacting residues inferred from such alignments have a different origin, related to thermal stability. A physical model is presented that illustrates this evolutionary scenario and its implications. The scenario can be implemented in experiments of protein evolution to directly test its predictions.
q-bio.BM:We present a detailed heuristic method to quantify the degree of local energetic frustration manifested by protein molecules. Current applications are realized in computational experiments where a protein structure is visualized highlighting the energetic conflicts or the concordance of the local interactions in that structure. Minimally frustrated linkages highlight the stable folding core of the molecule. Sites of high local frustration, in contrast, often indicate functionally relevant regions such as binding, active or allosteric sites.
q-bio.BM:While G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest class of membrane proteins, structures and endogenous ligands of a large portion of GPCRs remain unknown. Due to the involvement of GPCRs in various signaling pathways and physiological roles, the identification of endogenous ligands as well as designing novel drugs is of high interest to the research and medical communities. Along with highlighting the recent advances in structure-based ligand discovery, including docking and molecular dynamics, this article focuses on the latest advances for automating the discovery of bioactive ligands using machine learning. Machine learning is centered around the development and applications of algorithms that can learn from data automatically. Such an approach offers immense opportunities for bioactivity prediction as well as quantitative structure-activity relationship studies. This review describes the most recent and successful applications of machine learning for bioactive ligand discovery, concluding with an outlook on deep learning methods that are capable of automatically extracting salient information from structural data as a promising future direction for rapid and efficient bioactive ligand discovery.
q-bio.BM:Proteins are only moderately stable. It has long been debated whether this narrow range of stabilities is solely a result of neutral drift towards lower stability or purifying selection against excess stability is also at work - for which no experimental evidence was found so far. Here we show that mutations outside the active site in the essential E. coli enzyme adenylate kinase result in stability-dependent increase in substrate inhibition by AMP, thereby impairing overall enzyme activity at high stability. Such inhibition caused substantial fitness defects not only in the presence of excess substrate but also under physiological conditions. In the latter case, substrate inhibition caused differential accumulation of AMP in the stationary phase for the inhibition prone mutants. Further, we show that changes in flux through Adk could accurately describe the variation in fitness effects. Taken together, these data suggest that selection against substrate inhibition and hence excess stability may have resulted in a narrow range of optimal stability observed for modern proteins.
q-bio.BM:Although algebraic graph theory based models have been widely applied in physical modeling and molecular studies, they are typically incompetent in the analysis and prediction of biomolecular properties when compared with other quantitative approaches. There is a need to explore the capability and limitation of algebraic graph theory for molecular and biomolecular modeling, analysis, and prediction. In this work, we propose novel algebraic graph learning (AGL) models that encode high-dimensional physical and biological information into intrinsically low-dimensional representations. The proposed AGL model introduces multiscale weighted colored subgraphs to describe crucial molecular and biomolecular interactions via graph invariants associated with the graph Laplacian, its pseudo-inverse, and adjacent matrix. Additionally, the AGL models are incorporated with an advanced machine learning algorithm to connect the low-dimensional graph representation of biomolecular structures with their macroscopic properties. Three popular protein-ligand binding affinity benchmarks, namely CASF-2007, CASF-2013, and CASF-2016, are employed to validate the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of the present AGL model. Numerical results indicate that the proposed AGL method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in the binding affinity predictions of the protein-ligand complexes.
q-bio.BM:The intricate three-dimensional geometries of protein tertiary structures underlie protein function and emerge through a folding process from one-dimensional chains of amino acids. The exact spatial sequence and configuration of amino acids, the biochemical environment and the temporal sequence of distinct interactions yield a complex folding process that cannot yet be easily tracked for all proteins. To gain qualitative insights into the fundamental mechanisms behind the folding dynamics and generic features of the folded structure, we propose a simple model of structure formation that takes into account only fundamental geometric constraints and otherwise assumes randomly paired connections. We find that despite its simplicity, the model results in a network ensemble consistent with key overall features of the ensemble of Protein Residue Networks we obtained from more than 1000 biological protein geometries as available through the Protein Data Base. Specifically, the distribution of the number of interaction neighbors a unit (amino acid) has, the scaling of the structure's spatial extent with chain length, the eigenvalue spectrum and the scaling of the smallest relaxation time with chain length are all consistent between model and real proteins. These results indicate that geometric constraints alone may already account for a number of generic features of protein tertiary structures.
q-bio.BM:Direct comparison of three-dimensional (3D) objects is computationally expensive due to the need for translation, rotation, and scaling of the objects to evaluate their similarity. In applications of 3D object comparison, often identifying specific local regions of objects is of particular interest. We have recently developed a set of 2D moment invariants based on discrete orthogonal Krawtchouk polynomials for comparison of local image patches. In this work, we extend them to 3D and construct 3D Krawtchouk descriptors (3DKD) that are invariant under translation, rotation, and scaling. The new descriptors have the ability to extract local features of a 3D surface from any region-of-interest. This property enables comparison of two arbitrary local surface regions from different 3D objects. We present the new formulation of 3DKD and apply it to the local shape comparison of protein surfaces in order to predict ligand molecules that bind to query proteins.
q-bio.BM:Exploring and understanding the protein-folding problem has been a long-standing challenge in molecular biology. Here, using molecular dynamics simulation, we reveal how parallel distributed adjacent planar peptide groups of unfolded proteins fold reproducibly following explicit physical folding codes in aqueous environments due to electrostatic attractions. Superfast folding of protein is found to be powered by the contribution of the formation of hydrogen bonds. Temperature-induced torsional waves propagating along unfolded proteins break the parallel distributed state of specific amino acids, inferred as the beginning of folding. Electric charge and rotational resistance differences among neighboring side-chains are used to decipher the physical folding codes by means of which precise secondary structures develop. We present a powerful method of decoding amino acid sequences to predict native structures of proteins. The method is verified by comparing the results available from experiments in the literature.
q-bio.BM:Proteins are essential for maintaining life. For example, knowing the structure of a protein, cell regulatory mechanisms of organisms can be modeled, supporting the development of disease treatments or the understanding of relationships between protein structures and food attributes. However, discovering the structure of a protein can be a difficult and expensive task, since it is hard to explore the large search to predict even a small protein. Template-based methods (coarse-grained, homology, threading etc) depend on Prior Knowledge (PK) of proteins determined using other methods as X-Ray Crystallography or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. On the other hand, template-free methods (full-atom and ab initio) rely on atoms physical-chemical properties to predict protein structures. In comparison with other approaches, the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) can require significant less PK, suggesting that it could be adequate for proteins of low-level of PK. Finding an EDA able to handle both prediction quality and computational time is a difficult task, since they are strong inversely correlated. We developed an EDA specific for the ab initio Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) problem using full-atom representation. We developed one univariate and two bivariate probabilistic models in order to design a proper EDA for PSP. The bivariate models make relationships between dihedral angles $\phi$ and $\psi$ within an amino acid. Furthermore, we compared the proposed EDA with other approaches from the literature. We noticed that even a relatively simple algorithm such as Random Walk can find the correct solution, but it would require a large amount of prior knowledge (biased prediction). On the other hand, our EDA was able to correctly predict with no prior knowledge at all, characterizing such a prediction as pure ab initio.
q-bio.BM:Since the largest 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, understanding of Ebola virus infection has improved, notably the involvement of innate immune mediators. Amongst them, collectins are important players in the antiviral innate immune defense. A screening of Ebola glycoprotein (GP)-collectins interactions revealed the specific interaction of human surfactant protein D (hSP-D), a lectin expressed in lung and liver, two compartments where Ebola was found in vivo. Further analyses have demonstrated an involvement of hSP-D in the enhancement of virus infection in several in vitro models. Similar effects were observed for porcine SP-D (pSP-D). In addition, both hSP-D and pSP-D interacted with Reston virus (RESTV) GP and enhanced pseudoviral infection in pulmonary cells. Thus, our study reveals a novel partner of Ebola GP that may participate to enhance viral spread.
q-bio.BM:Artificial RNA molecules with novel functionality have many applications in synthetic biology, pharmacy and white biotechnology. The de novo design of such devices using computational methods and prediction tools is a resource-efficient alternative to experimental screening and selection pipelines. In this review, we describe methods common to many such computational approaches, thoroughly dissect these methods and highlight open questions for the individual steps. Initially, it is essential to investigate the biological target system, the regulatory mechanism that will be exploited, as well as the desired components in order to define design objectives. Subsequent computational design is needed to combine the selected components and to obtain novel functionality. This process can usually be split into constrained sequence sampling, the formulation of an optimization problem and an in silico analysis to narrow down the number of candidates with respect to secondary goals. Finally, experimental analysis is important to check whether the defined design objectives are indeed met in the target environment and detailed characterization experiments should be performed to improve the mechanistic models and detect missing design requirements.
q-bio.BM:Studying evolutionary correlations in alignments of homologous sequences by means of an inverse Potts model has proven useful to obtain residue-residue contact energies and to predict contacts in proteins. The quality of the results depend much on several choices of the detailed model and on the algorithms used. We built, in a very controlled way, synthetic alignments with statistical properties similar to those of real proteins, and used them to assess the performance of different inversion algorithms and of their variants. Realistic synthetic alignments display typical features of low--temperature phases of disordered systems, a feature that affects the inversion algorithms. We showed that a Boltzmann--learning algorithm is computationally feasible and performs well in predicting the energy of native contacts. However, all algorithms suffer of false positives quite equally, making the quality of the prediction of native contacts with the different algorithm much system--dependent.
q-bio.BM:G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large superfamily of membrane proteins that are activated by extracellular small molecules or photons. Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) is a GPCR that is activated by neurotensin, i.e. a 13 amino acid peptide. Binding of neurotensin induces conformational changes in the receptor that trigger the intracellular signaling processes. While recent single-molecule studies have reported a dynamic monomer - dimer equilibrium of NTSR1 in vitro, a biophysical characterization of the oligomerization status of NTSR1 in living mammalian cells is complicated. Here we report on the oligomerization state of the human NTSR1 tagged with mRuby3 by dissolving the plasma membranes of living HEK293T cells into 10 nm-sized soluble lipid nanoparticles by addition of styrene-maleic acid copolymers (SMALPs). Single SMALPs were analyzed one after another in solution by multi-parameter single molecule spectroscopy including brightness, fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy for homoFRET. Brightness analysis was improved using single SMALP detection in a confocal ABELtrap for extended observation times in solution. A bimodal brightness distribution indicated a significant fraction of dimeric NTSR1 in SMALPs or in the plasma membrane, respectively, before addition of neurotensin.
q-bio.BM:Hsp70 molecular chaperones are abundant ATP-dependent nanomachines that actively reshape non-native, misfolded proteins and assist a wide variety of essential cellular processes. Here we combine complementary computational/theoretical approaches to elucidate the structural and thermodynamic details of the chaperone-induced expansion of a substrate protein, with a particular emphasis on the critical role played by ATP hydrolysis. We first determine the conformational free-energy cost of the substrate expansion due to the binding of multiple chaperones using coarse-grained molecular simulations. We then exploit this result to implement a non-equilibrium rate model which estimates the degree of expansion as a function of the free energy provided by ATP hydrolysis. Our results are in quantitative agreement with recent single-molecule FRET experiments and highlight the stark non-equilibrium nature of the process, showing that Hsp70s are optimized to convert effectively chemical energy into mechanical work close to physiological conditions.
q-bio.BM:Membrane Proteins (MPs) account for around 15-39% of the human proteome and assume a critical role in a vast set of cellular and physiological mechanisms, including molecular transport, nutrient uptake, toxin and waste product clearance, respiration, and signaling. While roughly 60% of all FDA-approved drugs target MPs, there is a shortage of structural and biochemical data on them mainly hindered by their localization in the lipid bilayer. We present here MEmbrane protein dimer Novel Structure Analyser database (MENSAdb), a real time web-application exposing a broad array of fundamental features about MPs surface and their interfacial regions. In particular, we present conservation, four distinctive Accessible Solvent Area (ASA) descriptors, average and environment-specific B-factors, intermolecular contacts at 2.5 and 4.0 angstroms distance cutoffs, salt-bridges, hydrogen-bonds, hydrophobic, pi-pi interactions, t-stacking and cation-pi interactions. Additionally, users can closely inspect differences in values between three distinctive residues classes: i) non-surface, ii) surface and non-interfacial and iii) interfacial. The database is freely available at www.moreiralab.com/resources/mensadb.
q-bio.BM:Shape had been intuitively recognized to play a dominant role in determining the global motion patterns of bio-molecular assemblies. However, it is not clear exactly how shape determines the motion patterns. What about the local interactions that hold a structure together to a certain shape? The contributions of global shape and local interactions usually mix together and are difficult to tease part. In this work, we use symmetry to elucidate the distinct roles of global shape and local interactions in protein dynamics. Symmetric complexes provide an ideal platform for this task since in them the effects of local interactions and global shape are separable, allowing their distinct roles to be identified. Our key findings based on symmetric assemblies are: (i) the motion patterns of each subunit are determined primarily by intra-subunit interactions (IRSi), and secondarily by inter-subunit interactions (IESi); (ii) the motion patterns of the whole assembly are fully dictated by the global symmetry/shape and have nothing to do with local iESi or IRSi. This is followed by a discussion on how the findings may be generalized to complexes in any shape, with or without symmetry.
q-bio.BM:To reduce experimental effort associated with directed protein evolution and to explore the sequence space encoded by mutating multiple positions simultaneously, we incorporate machine learning in the directed evolution workflow. Combinatorial sequence space can be quite expensive to sample experimentally, but machine learning models trained on tested variants provide a fast method for testing sequence space computationally. We validate this approach on a large published empirical fitness landscape for human GB1 binding protein, demonstrating that machine learning-guided directed evolution finds variants with higher fitness than those found by other directed evolution approaches. We then provide an example application in evolving an enzyme to produce each of the two possible product enantiomers (stereodivergence) of a new-to-nature carbene Si-H insertion reaction. The approach predicted libraries enriched in functional enzymes and fixed seven mutations in two rounds of evolution to identify variants for selective catalysis with 93% and 79% ee. By greatly increasing throughput with in silico modeling, machine learning enhances the quality and diversity of sequence solutions for a protein engineering problem.
q-bio.BM:Computation of biological processes creates great promise for everyday life and great challenges for physical scientists. Simulations of molecular dynamics appeal to biologists as a natural extension of structural biology. Once biologists see a structure, they want to see it move. Molecular biology shows that a few atoms, often messenger ions like Ca$^{2+}$, control biological function on the scale of cells, sometimes organisms. Enormously concentrated ions (~20 M) in protein channels and enzymes can control important characteristics of living systems, just as highly concentrated ions near electrodes control important characteristics of electrochemical systems. The scale differences needed to simulate all the atoms of biological cells are $10^7$ in linear dimension, $10^{21}$ in three dimensions, $10^{9}$ in resolution, $10^{11}$ in time, and $10^{13}$ in particle number (to deal with concentrations of Ca$^{2+}$). $\mathbf{These}$ $\mathbf{scales}$ $\mathbf{must}$ $\mathbf{be}$ $\mathbf{dealt}$ $\mathbf{with}$ $\mathbf{simultaneously}$ if the simulation is to deal with most biological functions. We suggest a computational approach using explicit multiscale analysis instead of implicit simulation of all scales. Successful computation of ions concentrated in special places may be a significant step to understanding the defining characteristics of biological and electrochemical systems.
q-bio.BM:Ligands entering a protein binding pocket essentially compete with water molecules for binding to the protein. Hence, the location and thermodynamic properties of water molecules in protein structures have gained increased attention in the drug design community. Including corresponding data into 3D pharmacophore modeling is essential for efficient high throughput virtual screening. Here, we present PyRod, a free and open-source python software that allows for visualization of pharmacophoric binding pocket characteristics, identification of hot spots for ligand binding and subsequent generation of pharmacophore features for virtual screening. The implemented routines analyze the protein environment of water molecules in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and can differentiate between hydrogen bonded waters as well as waters in a protein environment of hydrophobic, charged or aromatic atom groups. The gathered information is further processed to generate dynamic molecular interaction fields (dMIFs) for visualization and pharmacophoric features for virtual screening. The described software was applied to 5 therapeutically relevant drug targets and generated pharmacophores were evaluated using DUD-E benchmarking sets. The best performing pharmacophore was found for the HIV1 protease with an early enrichment factor of 54.6. PyRod adds a new perspective to structure-based screening campaigns by providing easy-to-interpret dMIFs and purely protein-based 3D pharmacophores that are solely based on tracing water molecules in MD simulations. Since structural information about co-crystallized ligands is not needed, screening campaigns can be followed, for which less or no ligand information is available. PyRod is freely available at https://github.com/schallerdavid/pyrod.
q-bio.BM:The double-helical structure of DNA results from canonical base pairing and stacking interactions. However, variations from steady-state conformations result from mechanical perturbations in cells. These different topologies have physiological relevance but their dependence on sequence remains unclear. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that sequence differences result in markedly different structural motifs upon physiological twisting and stretching. We simulated overextension on four different sequences of DNA ((AA)12, (AT)12, (GG)12 and (GC)12) with supercoiling densities within the physiological range. We found that DNA denatures in the majority of stretching simulations, surprisingly including those with overtwisted DNA. GC-rich sequences were observed to be more stable than AT-rich, with the specific response dependent on base pair ordering. Furthermore, we found that (AT)12 forms stable periodic structures with non-canonical hydrogen bonds in some regions and non-canonical stacking in others, whereas (GC)12 forms a stacking motif of four base pairs independent of supercoiling density. Our results demonstrate that 20-30% DNA extension is sufficient for breaking B-DNA around and significantly above cellular supercoiling, and that the DNA sequence is crucial for understanding structural changes under mechanical stress. Our findings have important implications for the activities of protein machinery interacting with DNA in all cells.
q-bio.BM:Here, we show by solution nuclear magnetic resonance measurements that the urea-unfolded protein apoazurin becomes elongated when the synthetic crowding agent dextran 20 is present, in contrast to the prediction from the macromolecular crowding effect based on the argument of volume exclusion. To explore the complex interactions beyond volume exclusion, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to explore the conformational ensemble of apoazurin in a box of monodisperse crowders under strong chemically denaturing conditions. The elongated conformation of unfolded apoazurin appears to result from the interplay of the effective attraction between the protein and crowders and the shape of the crowders. With a volume-conserving crowder model, we show that the crowder shape provides an anisotropic direction of the depletion force, in which a bundle of surrounding rod-like crowders stabilize an elongated conformation of unfolded apoazurin in the presence of effective attraction between the protein and crowders.
q-bio.BM:14-3-3 proteins are a group of seven dimeric adapter proteins that exert their biological function by interacting with hundreds of phosphorylated proteins, thus influencing their sub-cellular localization, activity or stability in the cell. Due to this remarkable interaction network, 14-3-3 proteins have been associated with several pathologies and the protein-protein interactions established with a number of partners are now considered promising drug targets. The activity of 14-3-3 proteins is often isoform specific and to our knowledge only one out of seven isoforms, 14-3-3$\zeta$, has been assigned. Despite the availability of the crystal structures of all seven isoforms of 14-3-3, the additional NMR assignments of 14-3-3 proteins are important for both biological mechanism studies and chemical biology approaches. Herein, we present a robust backbone assignment of 14-3-3$\sigma$, which will allow advances in the discovery of potential therapeutic compounds. This assignment is now being applied to the discovery of both inhibitors and stabilizers of 14-3-3 protein-protein interactions.
q-bio.BM:A growing number of experimental evidence shows that it is general for a ligand binding protein to have a potential for allosteric regulation and for further evolution. In addition, such proteins generically change their conformation upon binding. O. Rivoire has recently proposed an evolutionary scenario that explains these properties as a generic byproduct of selection for exquisite discrimination between very similar ligands. The initial claim was supported by two classes of basic examples: continuous protein models with small numbers of degrees of freedom, on which the development of a conformational switch was established, and a 2-dimensional spin glass model supporting the rest of the statement. This work aimed to clarify the implication of the exquisite discrimination for smooth models with large number of degrees of freedom, the situation closer to real biological systems. With the help of differential geometry, jet-space analysis, and transversality theorems, it is shown that the claim holds true for any generic flexible system that can be described in terms of smooth manifolds. The result suggests that, indeed, evolutionary solutions to the exquisite discrimination problem, if exist, are located near a codimension-1 subspace of the appropriate genotypical space. This constraint, in turn, gives rise to a potential for the allosteric regulation of the discrimination via generic conformational changes upon binding.
q-bio.BM:The coding space of protein sequences is shaped by evolutionary constraints set by requirements of function and stability. We show that the coding space of a given protein family--the total number of sequences in that family--can be estimated using models of maximum entropy trained on multiple sequence alignments of naturally occuring amino acid sequences. We analyzed and calculated the size of three abundant repeat proteins families, whose members are large proteins made of many repetitions of conserved portions of ~ 30 amino acids. While amino acid conservation at each position of the alignment explains most of the reduction of diversity relative to completely random sequences, we found that correlations between amino acid usage at different positions significantly impact that diversity. We quantified the impact of different types of correlations, functional and evolutionary, on sequence diversity. Analysis of the detailed structure of the coding space of the families revealed a rugged landscape, with many local energy minima of varying sizes with a hierarchical structure, reminiscent of fustrated energy landscapes of spin glass in physics. This clustered structure indicates a multiplicity of subtypes within each family, and suggests new strategies for protein design.
q-bio.BM:Comprehensive and unambiguous identification of small molecules in complex samples will revolutionize our understanding of the role of metabolites in biological systems. Existing and emerging technologies have enabled measurement of chemical properties of molecules in complex mixtures and, in concert, are sensitive enough to resolve even stereoisomers. Despite these experimental advances, small molecule identification is inhibited by (i) chemical reference libraries representing <1% of known molecules, limiting the number of possible identifications, and (ii) the lack of a method to generate candidate matches directly from experimental features (i.e. without a library). To this end, we developed a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a continuous numerical, or latent, representation of molecular structure to expand reference libraries for small molecule identification. We extended the VAE to include a chemical property decoder, trained as a multitask network, in order to shape the latent representation such that it assembles according to desired chemical properties. The approach is unique in its application to small molecule identification, with its focus on m/z and CCS, paired with its training paradigm, which involved a cascade of transfer learning iterations. This allows the network to learn as much as possible at each stage, enabling success with progressively smaller datasets without overfitting. Once trained, the network can rapidly predict chemical properties directly from structure, as well as generate candidate structures with desired chemical properties. Additionally, the ability to generate novel molecules along manifolds, defined by chemical property analogues, positions DarkChem as highly useful in a number of application areas, including metabolomics and small molecule identification, drug discovery and design, chemical forensics, and beyond.
q-bio.BM:Atomic Force Microscopy was utilized to study the morphology of Gag, {\Psi}RNA, and their binding complexes with lipids in a solution environment with 0.1{\AA} vertical and 1nm lateral resolution. TARpolyA RNA was used as a RNA control. The lipid used was phospha-tidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). The morphology of specific complexes Gag-{\Psi}RNA, Gag-TARpolyA RNA, Gag-PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4,5)P2-{\Psi}RNA-Gag were studied. They were imaged on either positively or negatively charged mica substrates depending on the net charges carried. Gag and its complexes consist of monomers, dimers and tetramers, which was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The addition of specific {\Psi}RNA to Gag is found to increase Gag multimerization. Non-specific TARpolyA RNA was found not to lead to an increase in Gag multimerization. The addition PI(4,5)P2 to Gag increases Gag multimerization, but to a lesser extent than {\Psi}RNA. When both {\Psi}RNA and PI(4,5)P2 are present Gag undergoes comformational changes and an even higher degree of multimerization.
q-bio.BM:Native contacts between residues could be predicted from the amino acid sequence of proteins, and the predicted contact information could assist the de novo protein structure prediction. Here, we present a novel pipeline of a residue contact predictor AmoebaContact and a contact-assisted folder GDFold for rapid protein structure prediction. Unlike mainstream contact predictors that utilize human-designed neural networks, AmoebaContact adopts a set of network architectures that are found as optimal for contact prediction through automatic searching and predicts the residue contacts at a series of cutoffs. Different from conventional contact-assisted folders that only use top-scored contact pairs, GDFold considers all residue pairs from the prediction results of AmoebaContact in a differentiable loss function and optimizes the atom coordinates using the gradient descent algorithm. Combination of AmoebaContact and GDFold allows quick reconstruction of the protein structure, with comparable model quality to the state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods.
q-bio.BM:Given native 2D contact map, protein 3D structure could be reconstructed with accuracy of 2A or better, and such reconstruction is a feasible computational approach for protein folding problem. The prediction accuracy from traditional methods is generally too poor to useful, but the recent deep learning model has significantly improved the accuracy. In this study, we proposed a neural network model comprising a bi-directional recurrent neural network and artificial neural network. Over the non-redundant database of all available protein 3D structures in Protein Data Bank, this deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 0.80, much higher than those of previous models. This study represents a major breakthrough in protein 2D contact map prediction and likely a major step forward for the protein folding problem.
q-bio.BM:The outcome of an epidemic is closely related to the network of interactions between the individuals. Likewise, protein functions depend on the 3D arrangement of their residues and on the underlying energetic interaction network. Borrowing ideas from the theoretical framework that has been developed to address the spreading of real diseases, we study the diffusion of a fictitious epidemic inside the protein non-bonded interaction network. Our approach allowed to probe the overall stability and the capability to propagate information in the complex 3D-structures and proved to be very efficient in addressing different problems, from the assessment of thermal stability to the identification of allosteric sites.
q-bio.BM:A small fraction of all protein structures characterized so far are entangled. The challenge of understanding the properties of these knotted proteins, and the why and the how of their natural folding process, has been taken up in the past decade with different approaches, such as structural characterization, in vitro experiments, and simulations of protein models with varying levels of complexity. The simplest among these are the lattice G\=o models, which belong to the class of structure-based models, i.e., models that are biased to the native structure by explicitly including structural data. In this review we highlight the contributions to the field made in the scope of lattice G\=o models, putting them into perspective in the context of the main experimental and theoretical results and of other, more realistic, computational approaches.
q-bio.BM:The strength or weakness of an algorithm is ultimately governed by the confidence of its result. When the domain of the problem is large (e.g. traversal of a high-dimensional space), a perfect solution cannot be obtained, so approximations must be made. These approximations often lead to a reported quantity of interest (QOI) which varies between runs, decreasing the confidence of any single run. When the algorithm further computes this final QOI based on uncertain or noisy data, the variability (or lack of confidence) of the final QOI increases. Unbounded, these two sources of uncertainty (algorithmic approximations and uncertainty in input data) can result in a reported statistic that has low correlation with ground truth.   In biological applications, this is especially applicable, as the search space is generally approximated at least to some degree (e.g. a high percentage of protein structures are invalid or energetically unfavorable) and the explicit conversion from continuous to discrete space for protein representation implies some uncertainty in the input data. This research applies uncertainty quantification techniques to the difficult protein-protein docking problem, first showing the variability that exists in existing software, and then providing a method for computing probabilistic certificates in the form of Chernoff-like bounds. Finally, this paper leverages these probabilistic certificates to accurately bound the uncertainty in docking from two docking algorithms, providing a QOI that is both robust and statistically meaningful.
q-bio.BM:The problem of determining which nucleotides of an RNA sequence are paired or unpaired in the secondary structure of an RNA, which we call RNA state inference, can be studied by different machine learning techniques. Successful state inference of RNA sequences can be used to generate auxiliary information for data-directed RNA secondary structure prediction. Bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool that can model global nonlinear sequence dependencies and have achieved state-of-the-art performances on many different classification problems. This paper presents a practical approach to RNA secondary structure inference centered around a deep learning method for state inference. State predictions from a deep bidirectional LSTM are used to generate synthetic SHAPE data that can be incorporated into RNA secondary structure prediction via the Nearest Neighbor Thermodynamic Model (NNTM). This method produces predicted secondary structures for a diverse test set of 16S ribosomal RNA that are, on average, 25 percentage points more accurate than undirected MFE structures. These improvements range from several percentage points for some sequences to nearly 50 percentage points for others. Accuracy is highly dependent on the success of our state inference method, and investigating the global features of our state predictions reveals that accuracy of both our state inference and structure inference methods are highly dependent on the similarity of the sequence to the dataset. This paper presents a deep learning state inference tool, trained and tested on 16S ribosomal RNA. Converting these state predictions into synthetic SHAPE data with which to direct NNTM can result in large improvements in secondary structure prediction accuracy, as shown on a test set of 16S rRNA.
q-bio.BM:The total phenols and flavonoids content of different polar solvent extracts from Aurea Helianthus flowers, and their antioxidant activity were determined. The ethanol extract of Aurea Helianthus flowers were suspended in water and fractionated using different polar solvents; hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. The parameters of each extract mentioned above were determined using Floin-ciocalteu reagent(FCR) method, AlCl3 colorimetry method, ferric reducing ability of plasma(FRAP) assay, total antioxidant activity(TAA) assay and DPPH radical scavenging assay. The highest total phenols content(516.21 mg GAE/g) and flavonoids content(326.06 mg QCE/g) were obtained in ethyl acetate extract, the correlation between TPC and TFC assay was founded to be 0.967. All polar solvent extracts of Aurea Helianthus flowers showed significant antioxidant effects, the hightest inhibition was obtained in ethyl acetate and choroform extracts and the lowest inhibition in the water extract. There is a good correlation of total phenols and flavonoids content with antioxidant activity. This work indicated that the polar solvent extracts of Aurea Helianthus flowers contain high phenols and flavonoids content and exhibited antioxidant activities in vitro, therefore, could be candidates for use as natural antioxidant.
q-bio.BM:The effects of purification methods and its hypolipidemic function on the total flavonoids of Aurea Helianthus flower were investigated. Liquid-liquid extraction of ethanol extract from Aurea Helianthus flower was carried out by using different polar solvents. The extract with the highest total flavonoid content was selected, and the optimal conditions for purification of total flavonoids were determined by purification with macroporous resin. The human digestive environment was simulated in vitro, and the binding ability of different flavonoid samples to three kinds of cholate was compared. The results showed that the purity of total flavonoids in ethanol extract was 27.8%, the purity of total flavonoids in ethyl acetate extract was 46.4%, and the purity was increased by 18.6%. Subsequent purification with AB-8 macroporous resin; loading of total flavonoids at a concentration of 5.5 mg/mL, flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, 110 mL; use of 75% ethanol, 80 mL as eluent at a flow rate of 1.5 mL The elution at /min resulted in a total flavonoid purity of 83.5 % and an increase of 37.1%, and a good purification effect was obtained. The binding rate of total flavonoids purified by AB-8 macroporous resin to sodium taurocholate, sodium glycocholate and sodium cholate was 88.2%, 73.2% and 75.8 %, respectively. The binding ability was the strongest, and the others were ethyl acetate. Extract, ethanol extract. The purity of total flavonoids showed a good correlation with the binding capacity of cholate, and the correlation coefficient was between 0.963 and 0.988. The total flavonoids of Aurea Helianthus flower have good bile acid binding ability and can be used as the focus of natural hypolipidemic substances.
q-bio.BM:Current methods for investigation of receptor - ligand interactions in drug discovery are based on three-dimensional complementarity of receptor and ligand surfaces, and they include pharmacophore modelling, QSAR, molecular docking etc. Those methods only consider short-range molecular interactions (distances <5A), and not include long-range interactions (distances >5A) which are essential for kinetic of biochemical reactions because they influence the number of productive collisions between interacting molecules. Previously was shown that the electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP) represents the physical property which determines the long-range properties of biological molecules. This molecular descriptor served as a base for development of the informational spectrum method (ISM), a virtual spectroscopy method for investigation of protein-protein interactions. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to treat small molecules as linear entities, allowing study of the small molecule - protein interaction by ISM. We analyzed here 21 sets of KEGG drug-protein interactions and showed that this new approach allows an efficient discrimination between biologically active and inactive ligands, and consistence with AA regions of their binding site on the target protein.
q-bio.BM:Estrogen receptors (ERs) are a group of proteins activated by 17$\beta$-estradiol. The endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) mimic estrogen action by bind directly to the ligand binding domain of ER. From this perspective, ER represent a good model for identifying and assessing the health risk of potential EDCs. This ability is best reflected by the ligand-ER binding energy. Multilayer fragment molecular orbital (MFMO) calculations were performed which allowed us to obtain the binding energy using a calculation scheme that considers the molecular interactions that occur on the following model systems: the bound and free receptor, 17$\beta$-estradiol and a water cluster. The bound and free receptor and 17$\beta$-estradiol were surrounded by a water shell containing the same number of molecules as the water cluster. The structures required for MFMO calculations were obtained from molecular dynamics simulations and cluster analysis. Attractive dispersion interactions were observed between 17$\beta$-estradiol and the binding site hydrophobic residues. In addition, strong electrostatic interactions were found between 17$\beta$-estradiol and the following charged/polarized residues: Glu 353, His 524 and Arg 394. The FMO2-RHF/STO-3G:MP2/6-31G(d) weighted binding energy was of -67.2 kcal/mol. We hope that the model developed in this study can be useful for identifying and assessing the health risk of potential EDCs.
q-bio.BM:Significant progress in computer hardware and software have enabled molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model complex biological phenomena such as protein folding. However, enabling MD simulations to access biologically relevant timescales (e.g., beyond milliseconds) still remains challenging. These limitations include (1) quantifying which set of states have already been (sufficiently) sampled in an ensemble of MD runs, and (2) identifying novel states from which simulations can be initiated to sample rare events (e.g., sampling folding events). With the recent success of deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques in analyzing large datasets, we posit that these techniques can also be used to adaptively guide MD simulations to model such complex biological phenomena. Leveraging our recently developed unsupervised deep learning technique to cluster protein folding trajectories into partially folded intermediates, we build an iterative workflow that enables our generative model to be coupled with all-atom MD simulations to fold small protein systems on emerging high performance computing platforms. We demonstrate our approach in folding Fs-peptide and the $\beta\beta\alpha$ (BBA) fold, FSD-EY. Our adaptive workflow enables us to achieve an overall root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) to the native state of 1.6$~\AA$ and 4.4~$\AA$ respectively for Fs-peptide and FSD-EY. We also highlight some emerging challenges in the context of designing scalable workflows when data intensive deep learning techniques are coupled to compute intensive MD simulations.
q-bio.BM:Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) has become an extremely powerful method for resolving structural details of large biomolecular complexes. However, challenging problems in single-particle methods remain open because of (1) the low signal-to-noise ratio in EM; and (2) the potential anisotropy and lack of coverage of projection directions relative to the body-fixed coordinate system for some complexes. Whereas (1) is usually addressed by class averaging (and increasingly due to rapid advances in microscope and sensor technology), (2) is an artifact of the mechanics of interaction of biomolecular complexes and the vitrification process. In the absence of tilt series, (2) remains a problem, which is addressed here by supplementing EM data with Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS). Whereas SAXS is of relatively low resolution and contains much lower information content than EM, we show that it is nevertheless possible to use SAXS to fill in blind spots in EM in difficult cases where the range of projection directions is limited.
q-bio.BM:We present the assembly category assessment in the 13th edition of the CASP community-wide experiment. For the second time, protein assemblies constitute an independent assessment category. Compared to the last edition we see a clear uptake in participation, more oligomeric targets released, and consistent, albeit modest, improvement of the predictions quality. Looking at the tertiary structure predictions we observe that ignoring the oligomeric state of the targets hinders modelling success. We also note that some contact prediction groups successfully predicted homomeric interfacial contacts, though it appears that these predictions were not used for assembly modelling. Homology modelling with sizeable human intervention appears to form the basis of the assembly prediction techniques in this round of CASP. Future developments should see more integrated approaches to modelling where multiple subunits are a natural part of the modelling process, which would benefit the structure prediction field as a whole.
q-bio.BM:Virtual reality is a powerful tool with the ability to immerse a user within a completely external environment. This immersion is particularly useful when visualizing and analyzing interactions between small organic molecules, molecular inorganic complexes, and biomolecular systems such as redox proteins and enzymes. A common tool used in the biomedical community to analyze such interactions is the APBS software, which was developed to solve the equations of continuum electrostatics for large biomolecular assemblages. Numerous applications exist for using APBS in the biomedical community including analysis of protein ligand interactions and APBS has enjoyed widespread adoption throughout the biomedical community. Currently, typical use of the full APBS toolset is completed via the command line followed by visualization using a variety of two-dimensional external molecular visualization software. This process has inherent limitations: visualization of three-dimensional objects using a two-dimensional interface masks important information within the depth component. Herein, we have developed a single application, UnityMol-APBS, that provides a dual experience where users can utilize the full range of the APBS toolset, without the use of a command line interface, by use of a simple \ac{GUI} for either a standard desktop or immersive virtual reality experience.
q-bio.BM:Evidence accumulated over the past decade provides support for liquid-liquid phase separation as the mechanism underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates, which include not only membraneless organelles such as nucleoli and RNA granules, but additional assemblies involved in transcription, translation and signaling. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of condensate function requires knowledge of the structures of their constituents. Current knowledge suggests that structures formed via multivalent domain-motif interactions remain largely unchanged within condensates. Two different viewpoints exist regarding structures of disordered low-complexity domains within condensates; one argues that low-complexity domains remain largely disordered in condensates and their multivalency is encoded in short motifs called stickers, while the other argues that the sequences form cross-beta structures resembling amyloid fibrils. We review these viewpoints and highlight outstanding questions that will inform structure-function relationships for biomolecular condensates.
q-bio.BM:Grid diagrams with their relatively simple mathematical formalism provide a convenient way to generate and model projections of various knots. It has been an open question whether these 2D diagrams can be used to model a complex 3D process such as the topoisomerase-mediated preferential unknotting of DNA molecules. We model here topoisomerase-mediated passages of double-stranded DNA segments through each other using the formalism of grid diagrams. We show that this grid diagram-based modelling approach captures the essence of the preferential unknotting mechanism, based on topoisomerase selectivity of hooked DNA juxtapositions as the sites of intersegmental passages. We show that grid diagram-based approach provide an important, new and computationally convenient framework for investigating entanglement in biopolymers.
q-bio.BM:Filament formation by non-cytoskeletal enzymes has been known for decades, yet only relatively recently has its wide-spread role in enzyme regulation and biology come to be appreciated. This comprehensive review summarizes what is known for each enzyme confirmed to form filamentous structures in vitro, and for the many that are known only to form large self-assemblies within cells. For some enzymes, studies describing both the in vitro filamentous structures and cellular self-assembly formation are also known and described. Special attention is paid to the detailed structures of each type of enzyme filament, as well as the roles the structures play in enzyme regulation and in biology. Where it is known or hypothesized, the advantages conferred by enzyme filamentation are reviewed. Finally, the similarities, differences, and comparison to the SgrAI system are also highlighted.
q-bio.BM:Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are artificial nucleic acids with a peptide backbone instead of sugar phosphate backbone of DNA or RNA. Their resistance to degradation, selectivity and greater binding affinity in comparison to usual nucleic acids led to consideration of their great potential for different applications. For example, they can be used in molecular diagnostics and antisense therapeutics such as antimicrobial agents or gene regulatory tools. On the other hand, large hydrophilic property of PNA molecules, which inhibit them to cross cell membranes readily, is an obstacle for their delivery to considered target cells and a limiting criterion for their applications. Therefore, PNA delivery technologies have been developing to hurdle this limitation. For example, addition of lysine residues, charged membrane penetrating peptide sequences, PNAs conjugated with antibodies or steroids, cationic liposomes as carriers of PNA conjugates, protective peptides and technology of photochemical internalization (PCI) as well as by the recent technology of nanoparticle-based delivery have been employed. In this article we compared different delivery technologies which can be applicable to PNAs. As a result nanoparticle-based delivery showed more advantages in comparison to others and its application is growing fast. Keywords: Target cell delivery, Peptide nucleic acid, PNA, Delivery.
q-bio.BM:The ability of homologous chromosomes (or selected chromosomal loci) to pair specifically in the apparent absence of DNA breakage and recombination represents a prominent feature of eukaryotic biology. The mechanism of homology recognition at the basis of such recombination-independent pairing has remained elusive. A number of studies have supported the idea that sequence homology can be sensed between intact DNA double helices in vivo. In particular, recent analyses of the two silencing phenomena in fungi, known as repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD), have provided genetic evidence for the existence of the direct homologous dsDNA-dsDNA pairing. Both RIP and MSUD likely rely on the same search strategy, by which dsDNA segments are matched as arrays of interspersed base-pair triplets. This process is general and very efficient, yet it proceeds normally without the RecA/Rad51/Dmc1 proteins. Further studies of RIP and MSUD may yield surprising insights into the function of DNA in the cell.
q-bio.BM:Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are important for biological functions. In contrast to folded proteins, molecular recognition among certain IDPs is "fuzzy" in that their binding and/or phase separation are stochastically governed by the interacting IDPs' amino acid sequences while their assembled conformations remain largely disordered. To help elucidate a basic aspect of this fascinating yet poorly understood phenomenon, the binding of a homo- or hetero-dimeric pair of polyampholytic IDPs is modeled statistical mechanically using cluster expansion. We find that the binding affinities of binary fuzzy complexes in the model correlate strongly with a newly derived simple "jSCD" parameter readily calculable from the pair of IDPs' sequence charge patterns. Predictions by our analytical theory are in essential agreement with coarse-grained explicit-chain simulations. This computationally efficient theoretical framework is expected to be broadly applicable to rationalizing and predicting sequence-specific IDP-IDP polyelectrostatic interactions.
q-bio.BM:One algorithm to predict protein structure is the residual dipolar coupling based residue assembly and filter tool (REDCRAFT). This algorithm exploits an exponential reduction of the search space of all possible structures to find a structure that best fits a set of experimental residual dipolar couplings. However, the minimum amount of data required to successfully determine a protein's structure using REDCRAFT has not been previously investigated. Here we explore the effect of reducing the amount of data used to fold proteins. Our goal is to reduce experimental data collection times while retaining the accuracy levels previously achieved with larger amounts of data. We also investigate incorporating a priori secondary structure information into REDCRAFT to improve its structure prediction ability.
q-bio.BM:It remains a challenging task to generate a vast variety of novel compounds with desirable pharmacological properties. In this work, a generative network complex (GNC) is proposed as a new platform for designing novel compounds, predicting their physical and chemical properties, and selecting potential drug candidates that fulfill various druggable criteria such as binding affinity, solubility, partition coefficient, etc. We combine a SMILES string generator, which consists of an encoder, a drug-property controlled or regulated latent space, and a decoder, with verification deep neural networks, a target-specific three-dimensional (3D) pose generator, and mathematical deep learning networks to generate new compounds, predict their drug properties, construct 3D poses associated with target proteins, and reevaluate druggability, respectively. New compounds were generated in the latent space by either randomized output, controlled output, or optimized output. In our demonstration, 2.08 million and 2.8 million novel compounds are generated respectively for Cathepsin S and BACE targets. These new compounds are very different from the seeds and cover a larger chemical space. For potentially active compounds, their 3D poses are generated using a state-of-the-art method. The resulting 3D complexes are further evaluated for druggability by a championing deep learning algorithm based on algebraic topology, differential geometry, and algebraic graph theories. Performed on supercomputers, the whole process took less than one week. Therefore, our GNC is an efficient new paradigm for discovering new drug candidates.
q-bio.BM:Recently, molecular fingerprints extracted from three-dimensional (3D) structures using advanced mathematics, such as algebraic topology, differential geometry, and graph theory have been paired with efficient machine learning, especially deep learning algorithms to outperform other methods in drug discovery applications and competitions. This raises the question of whether classical 2D fingerprints are still valuable in computer-aided drug discovery. This work considers 23 datasets associated with four typical problems, namely protein-ligand binding, toxicity, solubility and partition coefficient to assess the performance of eight 2D fingerprints. Advanced machine learning algorithms including random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, single-task deep neural network and multitask deep neural network are employed to construct efficient 2D-fingerprint based models. Additionally, appropriate consensus models are built to further enhance the performance of 2D-fingerprintbased methods. It is demonstrated that 2D-fingerprint-based models perform as well as the state-of-the-art 3D structure-based models for the predictions of toxicity, solubility, partition coefficient and protein-ligand binding affinity based on only ligand information. However, 3D structure-based models outperform 2D fingerprint-based methods in complex-based protein-ligand binding affinity predictions.
q-bio.BM:Aligning multiple protein structures can yield valuable information about structural similarities among related proteins, as well as provide insight into evolutionary relationships between proteins in a family. We have developed an algorithm (msTALI) for aligning multiple protein structures using biochemical and biophysical properties, including torsion angles, secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and surface accessibility. The algorithm is a progressive alignment algorithm motivated by popular techniques from multiple sequence alignment. It has demonstrated success in aligning the major structural regions of a set of proteins from the s/r kinase family. The algorithm was also successful at aligning functional residues of these proteins. In addition, the algorithm was also successful in aligning seven members of the acyl carrier protein family, including both experimentally derived as well as computationally modeled structures.
q-bio.BM:Hydrostatic pressure is a common perturbation to probe the conformations of proteins. There are two common forms of pressure dependent potentials of mean force (PMFs) derived from hydrophobic molecules available for the coarse grained molecular simulations of protein folding and unfolding under hydrostatic pressure. Although both PMF includes a desolvation barrier separating the well of a direct contact and the well of a solvent mediated contact, how these features vary with hydrostatic pressure is still debated. There is a need of a systematic comparison of these two PMFs on a protein. We investigated the two different pressure dependencies on the desolvation potential in a structure based protein model using coarse grained molecular simulations. We compared them to the known behavior a real protein based on experimental evidence. We showed that the protein s folding transition curve on the pressure temperature phase diagram depends on the relationship between the potential well minima and pressure. For protein that reduces the total volume under pressure, it is essential for the PMF to carry the feature that the direct contact well is essential less stable than the water mediated contact well at high pressure. We also comment on the practicality and importance of structure based minimalist models for understanding the phenomenological behavior of a protein under a wide range of phase space.
q-bio.BM:The ability to switch on the activity of an enzyme through its spontaneous reconstitution has proven to be a valuable tool in fundamental studies of enzyme structure/reactivity relationships or in the design of artificial signal transduction systems in bioelectronics, synthetic biology, or bioanalytical applications. In particular, those based on the spontaneous reconstitution/activation of the apo-PQQ-dependent soluble glucose dehydrogenase (sGDH) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were widely developed. However, the reconstitution mechanism of sGDH with its two cofactors, i.e. the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and Ca2+, remains unknown. The objective here is to elucidate this mechanism by stopped-flow kinetics under single-turnover conditions. The reconstitution of sGDH exhibited biphasic kinetics, characteristic of a square reaction scheme associated to two activation pathways. From a complete kinetic analysis, we were able to fully predict the reconstitution dynamic, but also to demonstrate that when PQQ first binds to the apo-sGDH, it strongly impedes the access of Ca2+ to its enclosed position at the bottom of the enzyme binding site, thereby greatly slowing down the reconstitution rate of sGDH. This slow calcium insertion may purposely be accelerated by providing more flexibility to the Ca2+ binding loop through the specific mutation of the calcium coordinating P248 proline residue, reducing thus the kinetic barrier to calcium ion insertion. The dynamic nature of the reconstitution process is also supported by the observation of a clear loop shift and a reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network and van der Waals interactions observed in both active sites of the apo and holo forms, a structural change modulation that was revealed from the refined X-ray structure of apo-sGDH (PDB:5MIN).
q-bio.BM:Bacterial infectious diseases are a major threat to human health. Timely and sensitive pathogenic bacteria detection is crucial in identifying the bacterial contaminations and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Due to limitations of conventional bacteria detection techniques there have been concerted research efforts towards development of new biosensors. Biosensors offering label free, whole bacteria detection are highly desirable over those relying on label based or pathogenic molecular components detection. The major advantage is eliminating the additional time and cost required for labeling or extracting the desired bacterial components. Here, we demonstrate rapid, sensitive and label free E. coli detection utilizing interferometric reflectance imaging enhancement allowing for visualizing individual pathogens captured on the surface. Enabled by our ability to count individual bacteria on a large sensor surface, we demonstrate a limit of detection of 2.2 CFU/ml from a buffer solution with no sample preparation. To the best of our knowledge, this high level of sensitivity for whole E. coli detection is unprecedented in label free biosensing. The specificity of our biosensor is validated by comparing the response to target bacteria E. coli and non target bacteria S. aureus, K. pneumonia and P. aeruginosa. The biosensor performance in tap water also proves that its detection capability is unaffected by the sample complexity. Furthermore, our sensor platform provides high optical magnification imaging and thus validation of recorded detection events as the target bacteria based on morphological characterization. Therefore, our sensitive and label free detection method offers new perspectives for direct bacterial detection in real matrices and clinical samples.
q-bio.BM:The second domain of gelsolin (G2) hosts mutations responsible for a hereditary form of amyloidosis. The active form of gelsolin is Ca2+-bound; it is also a dynamic protein, hence structural biologists often rely on the study of the isolated G2. However, the wild type G2 structure that have been used so far in comparative studies is bound to a crystallographic Cd2+, in lieu of the physiological calcium. Here, we report the wild type structure of G2 in complex with Ca2+ highlighting subtle ion-dependent differences. Previous findings on different G2 mutations are also briefly revised in light of these results.
q-bio.BM:Mutations in the gelsolin protein are responsible for a rare conformational disease known as AGel amyloidosis. Four of these mutations are hosted by the second domain of the protein (G2): D187N/Y, G167R and N184K. The impact of the latter has been so far evaluated only by studies on the isolated G2. Here we report the characterization of full-length gelsolin carrying the N184K mutation and compare the findings with those obtained on the wild type and the other variants. The crystallographic structure of the N184K variant in the Ca2+-free conformation shows remarkable similarities with the wild type protein. Only minimal local rearrangements can be observed and the mutant is as efficient as the wild type in severing filamentous actin. However, thermal stability of the pathological variant is compromised in the Ca2+-free conditions. These data suggest that the N to K substitution causes a local disruption of the H-bond network in the core of the G2 domain. Such a subtle rearrangement of the connections does not lead to significant conformational changes but severely affects the stability of the protein.
q-bio.BM:Fatty acid sugar esters represent an important class of non-ionic bio-based surfactants. They can be synthesized from vinyl fatty acids and sugars with enzyme as a catalyst. Herein, the influence of the solvent, the lipase and the temperature on a model reaction between vinyl palmitate and glucose via enzymatic catalysis has been investigated and the reaction conditions optimized. Full conversion into 6-O-glucose palmitate was reached in 40 hours in acetonitrile starting from a reactant ratio 1:1, at only 5%-wt loading of lipase from Candida antarctica B (CALB) without the presence of molecular sieves.
q-bio.BM:Predicting the three-dimensional (3D) functional structures of proteins remains an important computational milestone in molecular biology to be achieved. This feat is hinged on a clear understanding of the mechanism which proteins use to fold into their native structures. Since Levinthal's paradox, there has been a lot of progress in understanding this mechanism. Most of the earlier attempts were caught between assigning either hydrophobic interactions or hydrogen bonding as the dominant folding force. However, a consensus now seems to be emerging about hydrogen bonding being a stronger force. Interestingly, a view from chaperone action may further throw some light on the nature of the folding mechanism. Thus the very mechanisms which prevent protein aggregation and misfolding, could help us have a better understanding of the folding mechanism itself.
q-bio.BM:Mikhail Shapiro's lab investigated a promising new method for non-invasive control of calcium currents in individual cells in the nervous system by the selective heating of nanoparticles and show that simple physical laws, properly applied, explain what is happening, and so can be a foundation for constructing improved methods and techniques. They use custom built instrumentation and detailed quantitative measurement to show that special surface properties are not needed to explain their results. Their work is taken as an example of the need for quantitative measurement in biophysics and biology in general. Classical examples are cited and the argument is made that the success of structural and molecular biology has hidden the need for quantitative measurements and controls. Semiconductor and computational electronics is cited as a science even more successful than structural and molecular biology that depends on quantitative measurement, controls, and analysis.
physics.optics:A numerical study of the properties of Gaussian pulses propagating in planar waveguide under the combined effect of positive Kerr-type nonlinearity, diffraction in planar waveguides and anomalous or normal dispersion, is presented. It is demonstrated how the relative strength of dispersion and diffraction, the strength of nonlinearity and the initial spatial and temporal pulse chirps effect on the parameters of pulse compression, such as the maximal compression factor and the distance to the point of maximal compression.
physics.optics:We report on a theoretical and numerical investigation of the switching of power in new hybrid models of nonlinear coherent couplers consisting of optical slab waveguides with various orders of nonlinearity. The first model consists of two guides with second-order instead of the usual third-order susceptibilities as typified by the Jensen coupler. This second-order system is shown to have a power self-trapping transition at a critical power greater than the third-order susceptibility coupler. Next, we consider a mixed coupler composed of a second-order guide coupled to a third-order guide and show that, although it does not display a rigorous self-trapping transition, for a particular choice of parameters it does show a fairly abrupt trapping of power at a lower power than in the third-order coupler. By coupling this mixed nonlinear pair to a third, purely linear guide, the power trapping can be brought to even lower levels and in this way a satisfactory switching profile can be achieved at less than one sixth the input power needed in the Jensen coupler.
physics.optics:It is noted that the Jones-matrix formalism for polarization optics is a six-parameter two-by-two representation of the Lorentz group. It is shown that the four independent Stokes parameters form a Minkowskian four-vector, just like the energy-momentum four-vector in special relativity. The optical filters are represented by four-by-four Lorentz-transformation matrices. This four-by-four formalism can deal with partial coherence described by the Stokes parameters. A four-by-four matrix formulation is given for decoherence effects on the Stokes parameters, and a possible experiment is proposed. It is shown also that this Lorentz-group formalism leads to optical filters with a symmetry property corresponding to that of two-dimensional Euclidean transformations.
physics.optics:We study the electromagnetic scattering by multilayered biperiodic aggregates of dielectric layers and gratings of conducting plates. We show that the characteristic lengths of such structures provide a good control of absorption bands. The influence of the physical parameters of the problem (sizes, impedances) is discussed.
physics.optics:The propagation of an electromagnetic pulse in a plasma is studied for pulse durations that are comparable to the plasma period. When the carrier frequency of the incident pulse is much higher than the plasma frequency, the pulse propagates without distortion at its group speed. When the carrier frequency is comparable to the plasma frequency, the pulse is distorted and leaves behind it an electromagnetic wake.
physics.optics:We present scattering from many body systems in a new light. In place of the usual van Hove treatment, (applicable to a wide range of scattering processes using both photons and massive particles) based on plane waves, we calculate the scattering amplitude as a space-time integral over the scattering sample for an incident wave characterized by its correlation function which results from the shaping of the wave field by the apparatus. Instrument resolution effects - seen as due to the loss of correlation caused by the path differences in the different arms of the instrument are automatically included and analytic forms of the resolution function for different instruments are obtained. The intersection of the moving correlation volumes (those regions where the correlation functions are significant) associated with the different elements of the apparatus determines the maximum correlation lengths (times) that can be observed in a sample, and hence, the momentum (energy) resolution of the measurement. This geometrical picture of moving correlation volumes derived by our technique shows how the interaction of the scatterer with the wave field shaped by the apparatus proceeds in space and time. Matching of the correlation volumes so as to maximize the intersection region yields a transparent, graphical method of instrument design. PACS: 03.65.Nk, 3.80 +r, 03.75, 61.12.B
physics.optics:In this paper we extend for the case of Maxwell equations the "X-shaped" solutions previously found in the case of scalar (e.g., acoustic) wave equations. Such solutions are localized in theory, i.e., diffraction-free and particle-like (wavelets), in that they maintain their shape as they propagate. In the electromagnetic case they are particularly interesting, since they are expected to be Superluminal. We address also the problem of their practical, approximate production by finite (dynamic) radiators. Finally, we discuss the appearance of the X-shaped solutions from the purely geometric point of view of the Special Relativity theory.   [PACS nos.: 03.50.De; 1.20.Jb; 03.30.+p; 03.40.Kf; 14.80.-j.   Keywords: X-shaped waves; localized solutions to Maxwell equations; Superluminal waves; Bessel beams; Limited-dispersion beams; electromagnetic wavelets; Special Relativity; Extended Relativity].
physics.optics:This paper has been withdrawn by the authors until some changes are made.
physics.optics:The effect of dispersion or diffraction on zero-velocity solitons is studied for the generalized massive Thirring model describing a nonlinear optical fiber with grating or parallel-coupled planar waveguides with misaligned axes. The Thirring solitons existing at zero dispersion/diffraction are shown numerically to be separated by a finite gap from three isolated soliton branches. Inside the gap, there is an infinity of multi-soliton branches. Thus, the Thirring solitons are structurally unstable. In another parameter region (far from the Thirring limit), solitons exist everywhere.
physics.optics:We theoretically study reflection of light by a phase-conjugating mirror preceded by a partially reflecting normal mirror. The presence of a suitably chosen normal mirror in front of the phase conjugator is found to greatly enhance the total phase-conjugate reflected power, even up to an order of magnitude. Required conditions are that the phase-conjugating mirror itself amplifies upon reflection and that constructive interference of light in the region between the mirrors takes place. We show that the phase-conjugate reflected power then exhibits a maximum as a function of the transmittance of the normal mirror.
physics.optics:Reliable control of the deposition process of optical films and coatings frequently requires monitoring of the refractive index profile throughout the layer. In the present work a simple in situ approach is proposed which uses a WKBJ matrix representation of the optical transfer function of a single thin film on a substrate. Mathematical expressions are developed which represent the minima and maxima envelopes of the curves transmittance-vs-time and reflectance-vs-time. The refractive index and extinction coefficient depth profiles of different films are calculated from simulated spectra as well as from experimental data obtained during PECVD of silicon-compound films. Variation of the deposition rate with time is also evaluated from the position of the spectra extrema as a function of time. The physical and mathematical limitations of the method are discussed.
physics.optics:A new definition for the electromagnetic field velocity is proposed. The velocity depends on the physical fields.
physics.optics:We have fabricated light emitting diodes (LEDs) with Schottky contacts on Si-nanocrystals formed by simple techniques as used for standard Si devices. Orange electroluminescence (EL) from these LEDs could be seen with the naked eye at room temperature when a reverse bias voltage was applied. The EL spectrum has a major peak with a photon energy of 1.9 eV and a minor peak with a photon energy of 2.2 eV. Since the electrons and holes are injected into the radiative recombination centers related to nanocrystals through avalanche breakdown, the voltage needed for a visible light emission is reduced to 4.0 - 4.5 V, which is low enough to be applied by a standard Si transistor.
physics.optics:A general model is presented for coupling of high-$Q$ whispering-gallery modes in optical microsphere resonators with coupler devices possessing discrete and continuous spectrum of propagating modes. By contrast to conventional high-Q optical cavities, in microspheres independence of high intrinsic quality-factor and controllable parameters of coupling via evanescent field offer variety of regimes earlier available in RF devices. The theory is applied to the earlier-reported data on different types of couplers to microsphere resonators and complemented by experimental demonstration of enhanced coupling efficiency (about 80%) and variable loading regimes with Q>10^8 fused silica microspheres.
physics.optics:The mechanism of DC-Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic (EFISH) generation at weakly nonlinear buried Si(001)-SiO$_2$ interfaces is studied experimentally in planar Si(001)-SiO$_2$-Cr MOS structures by optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy with a tunable Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser. The spectral dependence of the EFISH contribution near the direct two-photon $E_1$ transition of silicon is extracted. A systematic phenomenological model of the EFISH phenomenon, including a detailed description of the space charge region (SCR) at the semiconductor-dielectric interface in accumulation, depletion, and inversion regimes, has been developed. The influence of surface quantization effects, interface states, charge traps in the oxide layer, doping concentration and oxide thickness on nonlocal screening of the DC-electric field and on breaking of inversion symmetry in the SCR is considered. The model describes EFISH generation in the SCR using a Green function formalism which takes into account all retardation and absorption effects of the fundamental and second harmonic (SH) waves, optical interference between field-dependent and field-independent contributions to the SH field and multiple reflection interference in the SiO$_2$ layer. Good agreement between the phenomenological model and our recent and new EFISH spectroscopic results is demonstrated. Finally, low-frequency electromodulated EFISH is demonstrated as a useful differential spectroscopic technique for studies of the Si-SiO$_2$ interface in silicon-based MOS structures.
physics.optics:The new mechanism for obtaining a nonlinear phase shift has been proposed and the schemes are described for its implementation. As it is shown, the interference of two waves with intensity-dependent amplitude ratio coming from the second harmonic generation should produce the nonlinear phase shift. The sign and amount of nonlinear distortion of a beam wavefront is dependent of the relative phase of the waves that is introduced by the phase element. Calculated value of $n_2^{eff}$ exceeds that connected with cascaded quadratic nonlinearity, at the same conditions.
physics.optics:We analyze the guiding problem in a realistic photonic crystal fiber using a novel full-vector modal technique, a biorthogonal modal method based on the nonselfadjoint character of the electromagnetic propagation in a fiber. Dispersion curves of guided modes for different fiber structural parameters are calculated along with the 2D transverse intensity distribution of the fundamental mode. Our results match those achieved in recent experiments, where the feasibility of this type of fiber was shown.
physics.optics:A new method for investigation of x-ray propagation in a rough narrow dielectric waveguide is proposed on the basis of the numerical integration of the quazioptical equation. In calculations a model rough surface was used with the given statistical properties. It was shown that the losses in the narrow waveguides strongly depend on the wall roughness and on the input angle. The losses are not zero even at zero input angle if the width of the waveguide is smaller or about 1 mkm. The effect is accounted for as the influence of diffraction. The angular spread of the transmitted X-ray radiation is much more narrow than the Fresnel angle of the total external reflection.
physics.optics:We study a generalized notion of two-mode squeezing for the Stokes and anti-Stokes fields in a model of a cavity Raman laser, which leads to a significant reduction in decoherence or quantum noise. The model comprises a loss-less cavity with classical pump, unsaturated medium and arbitrary homogeneous broadening and dispersion. Allowing for arbitrary linear combinations of the two modes in the definition of quadrature variables, we find that there always exists a combination of the two output modes which exhibits quadrature squeezing with noise reduction below the vacuum level. The number of noise photons for this combination mode is proportional to the square root of the number of Stokes noise photons.
physics.optics:We study the effects of higher order transversal modes in a model of a singly-resonant OPO, using both numerical solutions and mode expansions including up to two radial modes. The numerical and two-mode solutions predict lower threshold and higher conversion than the single-mode solution at negative dispersion. Relative power in the zero order radial mode ranges from about 88% at positive and small negative dispersion to 48% at larger negative dispersion, with most of the higher mode content in the first mode, and less than 2% in higher modes.
physics.optics:This paper presents a detailed numerical study of the effect of focusing on the conversion efficiency of low-loss singly-resonant parametric oscillators with collinear focusing of pump and signal. Results are given for the maximal pump depletion and for pump power levels required for various amounts of depletion, as functions of pump and signal confocal parameters, for kI/kP=0.33 and 0.50. It is found that the ratio of pump depletion to maximal depletion as a function of the ratio of pump power to threshold power agrees with the plane-wave prediction to within 5%, for a wide range of focusing conditions. The observed trends are explained as resulting from intensity and phase dependent mechanisms.
physics.optics:Via solution of appropriate variational problem it is shown that light beams with Gaussian spatial profile and sufficiently short duration provide maximal destruction of global coherence under nonlinear self-modulation.
physics.optics:The dynamics of Fabry-Perot cavity with suspended mirrors is described. The suspended mirrors are nonlinear oscillators interacting with each other through the laser circulating in the cavity. The degrees of freedom decouple in normal coordinates, which are the position of the center of mass and the length of the cavity. We introduce two parameters and study how the dynamics changes with respect to these parameters. The first parameter specifies how strong the radiation pressure is. It determines whether the cavity is multistable or not. The second parameter is the control parameter, which determines location of the cavity equilibrium states. The equilibrium state shows hysteresis if the control parameter varies within a wide range. We analyze stability of the equilibrium states and identify the instability region. The instability is explained in terms of the effective potential: the stable states correspond to local minima of the effective potential and unstable states correspond to local maxima. The minima of the effective potential defines the resonant frequencies for the oscillations of the cavity length. We find the frequencies, and analyze how to tune them. Multistability of the cavity with a feedback control system is analyzed in terms of the servo potential. The results obtained in this paper are general and apply to all Fabry-Perot cavities with suspended mirrors.
physics.optics:We show that an azimuthally-periodically-modulated bright ring "necklace" beam can self-trap in self-focusing Kerr media and can exhibit stable propagation for very large distances. These are the first bright (2+1) D beams to exhibit stable self-trapping in a system described by the cubic (2+1) D Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE).
physics.optics:We present a new class of micro lasers based on nanoporous molecular sieve host-guest systems. Organic dye guest molecules of 1-Ethyl-4-(4-(p-Dimethylaminophenyl)-1,3-butadienyl)-pyridinium Perchlorat were inserted into the 0.73-nm-wide channel pores of a zeolite AlPO$_4$-5 host. The zeolitic micro crystal compounds where hydrothermally synthesized according to a particular host-guest chemical process. The dye molecules are found not only to be aligned along the host channel axis, but to be oriented as well. Single mode laser emission at 687 nm was obtained from a whispering gallery mode oscillating in a 8-$\mu$m-diameter monolithic micro resonator, in which the field is confined by total internal reflection at the natural hexagonal boundaries inside the zeolitic microcrystals.
physics.optics:We report a quantum ring-like toroidal cavity naturally formed in a vertical-cavity-like active microdisk plane due to Rayleigh's band of whispering gallery modes. The $\sqrt{T}$-dependent redshift and a square-law property of microampere-range threshold currents down to 2 $\mu$A are consistent with a photonic quantum wire view, due to whispering gallery mode-induced dimensional reduction.
physics.optics:The effect of capture of X-ray beam into narrow submicron capillary was investigated with account for diffraction and decay of coherency by roughness scattering in transitional boundary layer. In contrast to well-known Andronov-Leontovich approach the losses do not vanish at zero gliding angle and scale proportional to the first power of roughness amplitude for small gliding angles. It was shown that for small correlation radius of roughness the scattering decay of coherency can be made of the same order as absorption decay of lower channeling modes to produce angular collimation of X-ray beams. Estimates were given for optimum capillary length at different roughness amplitudes for angular sensitivity of X-ray transmission and chenneling effects that can be usefull for designing of detector systems.
physics.optics:We report the measurement of the photons flux produced in parametric down-conversion, performed in photon counting regime with actively quenched silicon avalanche photodiodes as single photon detectors. Measurements are done with the detector in a well defined geometrical and spectral situation. By comparison of the experimental data with the theory, a value for the second order susceptibilities of the non linear crystal can be inferred.
physics.optics:In a frame of quasi-crystal approximation the dispersion equations are obtained for the wave vector of a coherent electromagnetic wave propagating in a media which contains a random set of parallel dielectric cylinders with possible overlapping. The results are compared with that for the case when a regularity at the cylinder placement exists.
physics.optics:Accurate calculation of internal and surface scattering losses in fused silica microspheres is done. We show that in microspheres internal scattering is partly inhibited as compared to losses in the bulk material. We pay attention on the effect of frozen thermodynamical capillary waves on surface roughness. We calculate also the value of mode splitting due to backscattering and other effects of this backscattering.
physics.optics:We analytically compute a localization criterion in double scattering approximation for a set of dielectric spheres or perfectly conducting disks uniformly distributed in a spatial volume which can be either spherical or layered. For every disordered medium, we numerically investigate a localization criterion, and examine the influence of the system parameters on the wavelength localization domains.
physics.optics:The use of specific symmetry properties of the optical second-harmonic generation (the s,s-exclusion rule) has allowed us to observe high-contrast hyper-Rayleigh interference patterns in a completely diffuse light - an effect having no analog in case of linear (Rayleigh) scattering.
physics.optics:We report detailed measurements of the pump-current dependency of the self-pulsating frequency of semiconductor CD lasers. A distinct kink in this dependence is found and explained using rate-equation model. The kink denotes a transition between a region where the self-pulsations are weakly sustained relaxation oscillations and a region where Q-switching takes place. Simulations show that spontaneous emission noise plays a crucial role for the cross-over.
physics.optics:A new method is proposed to produce population inversion on transitions involving the ground state of atoms. The method is realized experimentally with sodium atoms. Lasing at the frequency corresponding to the sodium D_2 line is achieved in the presence of pump radiation resonant to the D_1 line with helium as a buffer gas.
physics.optics:A moving dielectric appears to light as an effective gravitational field. At low flow velocities the dielectric acts on light in the same way as a magnetic field acts on a charged matter wave. We develop in detail the geometrical optics of moving dispersionless media. We derive a Hamiltonian and a Lagrangian to describe ray propagation. We elucidate how the gravitational and the magnetic model of light propagation are related to each other. Finally, we study light propagation around a vortex flow. The vortex shows an optical Aharonov--Bohm effect at large distances from the core, and, at shorter ranges, the vortex may resemble an optical black hole.
physics.optics:We report the first observation of a nonlinear mode in a cylindrical nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity. The field enhancement from cavity buildup, as well as the large chi3 optical nonlinearity due to resonantly-excited Rb-85 vapor, allows the nonlinear mode to form at low incident optical powers of less than a milliwatt. The mode is observed to occur for both the self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearity.
physics.optics:Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is used as a noninvasive probe of two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of copolymer vinylidene fluoride with trifluorethylene. The surface 2D ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in the topmost layer of LB films and a thickness independent (almost 2D) transition in the bulk of these films are observed in temperature studies of SHG.
physics.optics:An all optical set-reset flip flop is presented that is based on two coupled identical laser diodes. The lasers are coupled so that when one of the lasers lases it quenches lasing in the other laser. The state of the flip flop is determined by which laser is currently lasing. Rate equations are used to model the flip flop and obtain steady state characteristics. The flip flop is experimentally demonstrated by use of antireflection coated laser diodes and free space optics.
physics.optics:We report on the fabrication of what we believe is the first example of a two dimensional nonlinear periodic crystal\cite{berger}, where the refractive index is constant but in which the 2nd order nonlinear susceptibility is spatially periodic. Such a crystal allows for efficient quasi-phase matched 2nd harmonic generation using multiple reciprocal lattice vectors of the crystal lattice. External 2nd harmonic conversion efficiencies > 60% were measured with picosecond pulses. The 2nd harmonic light can be simultaneously phase matched by multiple reciprocal lattice vectors, resulting in the generation of multiple coherent beams. The fabrication technique is extremely versatile and allows for the fabrication of a broad range of 2-D crystals including quasi-crystals.
physics.optics:The influence of linearly and circularly polarized laser fields on the dynamics of fast electron-impact excitation in atomic helium is discussed. A detailed analysis is made in the excitation of 2^1S, 3^1S and 3^1D dressed states of helium target.
physics.optics:The nonlinear dynamics of dissipative quantum systems in incoherent laser fields is studied in the framework of master equation with random model describing the laser noise and Markovian approximation for dealing with the system-bath couplings.
physics.optics:We present a theoretical study of strong laser-atom interactions, when the laser field parameters are subjected to random processes. The atom is modelled by a two-level and three-level systems, while the statistical fluctuations of the laser field are described by a pre-Gaussian model.
physics.optics:We consider the effect of spatial correlations on sources of polarized electromagnetic radiation. The sources, assumed to be monochromatic, are constructed out of dipoles aligned along a line such that their orientation is correlated with their position. In one representative example, the dipole orientations are prescribed by a generalized form of the standard von Mises distribution for angular variables such that the azimuthal angle of dipoles is correlated with their position. In another example the tip of the dipole vector traces a helix around the symmetry axis of the source, thereby modelling the DNA molecule. We study the polarization properties of the radiation emitted from such sources in the radiation zone. For certain ranges of the parameters we find a rather striking angular dependence of polarization. This may find useful applications in certain biological systems as well as in astrophysical sources.
physics.optics:We study the dynamics of the reduced density matrix(RDM) of the field in the micromaser. The resonator is pumped by N-atomic clusters of two-level atoms. At each given instant there is only one cluster in the cavity. We find the conditions of the independent evolution of the matrix elements of RDM belonging to a (sub)diagonal of the RDM, i.e. conditions of the diagonal invariance for the case of pumping by N-atomic clusters. We analyze the spectrum of the evolution operator of the RDM and discover the existence of the quasitrapped states of the field mode. These states exist for a wide range of number of atoms in the cluster as well as for a broad range of relaxation rates. We discuss the hierarchy of dynamical processes in the micromaser and find an important property of the field states corresponding to the quasi-equilibrium: these states are close to either Fock states or to a superposition of the Fock states. A possibility to tune the distribution function of photon numbers is discussed.
physics.optics:Temporal and angular correlations in atom-mediated photon-photon scattering are measured. Good agreement is found with the theory presented in Part~I.
physics.optics:The mediated photon-photon interaction due to the resonant Kerr nonlinearity in an inhomogeneously broadened atomic vapor is considered. The time-scale for photon-photon scattering is computed and found to be determined by the inhomogeneous broadening and the magnitude of the momentum transfer. This time can be shorter than the atomic relaxation time. Effects of atom statistics are included and the special case of small-angle scattering is considered. In the latter case the time-scale of the nonlinear response remains fast, even though the linear response slows as the inverse of the momentum transfer.
physics.optics:A simple variation of the traditional Young's double slit experiment can demonstrate several subtleties of interference with polarized light, including Berry and Pancharatnam's phase. Since the position of the fringes depends on the polarization state of the light at the input, the apparatus can also be used to measure the light's polarization without a quarter-wave plate or an accurate measurement of the light's intensity. In principle this technique can be used for any wavelength of photon as long as one can effectively polarize the incoming radiation.
physics.optics:The combination of charge separation induced by the formation of a single photorefractive screening soliton and an applied external bias field in a paraelectric is shown to lead to a family of useful electro-optic guiding patterns and properties.
physics.optics:The nonlinear pulse propagation in an optical fibers with varying parameters is investigated. The capture of moving in the frequency domain femtosecond colored soliton by a dispersive trap formed in an amplifying fiber makes it possible to accumulate an additional energy and to reduce significantly the soliton pulse duration. Nonlinear dynamics of the chirped soliton pulses in the dispersion managed systems is also investigated. The methodology developed does provide a systematic way to generate infinite ``ocean'' of the chirped soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NSE) with varying coefficients.
physics.optics:The Jaynes-Cummings model describing the interaction of a single linearly- polarized mode of the quantized electromagnetic field with an isolated two- level atom is generalized to the case of atomic levels degenerate in the projections of the angular momenta on the quantization axis, which is a usual case in the experiments. This generalization, like the original model, obtains the explicit solution. The model is applied to calculate the dependence of the atomic level populations on the angle between the polarization of cavity field mode and that of the laser excitation pulse in the experiment with one-atom micromaser.
physics.optics:We deduce the simplest form for an axicon Gaussian laser beam, i.e., one with radial polarization of the electric field.
physics.optics:We consider a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave incident on an opaque screen with square aperture of edge a. An application of Faraday's law to a loop parallel to the screen, on the side away from the source, shows that the wave must have longitudinal components there. The ratio of the longitudinal to transverse field is a measure of the diffraction angle.
physics.optics:We show that a time-reversed formulation of Huygens-Kirchhoff diffraction can be used to deduce the transverse and longitudinal fields of a Gaussian laser beam, starting from a simple assumption of a Gaussian beam profile in the far field. An attempt to apply this technique to the far fields of a Hertzian dipole shows how the laws of diffraction do not permit a wave to be focused to a volume smaller than a cubic wavelength in a charge-free region.
physics.optics:Slow light generated by Electromagnetically Induced Transparency is extremely susceptible with respect to Doppler detuning. Consequently, slow-light gyroscopes should have ultrahigh sensitivity.
physics.optics:The second-harmonic interferometric spectroscopy (SHIS) which combines both amplitude (intensity) and phase spectra of the second-harmonic (SH) radiation is proposed as a new spectroscopic technique being sensitive to the type of critical points (CP's) of combined density of states at semiconductor surfaces. The increased sensitivity of SHIS technique is demonstrated for the buried Si(111)-SiO$_2$ interface for SH photon energies from 3.6 eV to 5 eV and allows to separate the resonant contributions from $E^\prime_0/E_1$, $E_2$ and $E^\prime_1$ CP's of silicon.
physics.optics:The frequency of a 700mW monolithic non-planar Nd:YAG ring laser (NPRO) depends with a large coupling coefficient (some MHz/mW) on the power of its laser-diode pump source. Using this effect we demonstrate the frequency stabilization of an NPRO to a frequency reference by feeding back to the current of its pump diodes. We achieved an error point frequency noise smaller than 1mHz/sqrt(Hz), and simultaneously a reduction of the power noise of the NPRO by 10dB without an additional power stabilization feed-back system.
physics.optics:We deduce the emissivity of radiation from a metallic surface as a function of angle and polarization. This effect has found application in the calibration of detectors for cosmic microwave background radiation.
physics.optics:We present the first experimental observation of modulation instability of partially spatially incoherent light beams in non-instantaneous nonlinear media. We show that even in such a nonlinear partially coherent system (of weakly-correlated particles) patterns can form spontaneously. Incoherent MI occurs above a specific threshold that depends on the beams' coherence properties (correlation distance), and leads to a periodic train of one-dimensional (1D) filaments. At a higher value of nonlinearity, incoherent MI displays a two-dimensional (2D) instability and leads to self-ordered arrays of light spots.
physics.optics:We study the polarization of light emitted by spatially correlated sources. We show that in general polarization acquires nontrivial spectral dependence due to spatial correlations. The spectral dependence is found to be absent only for a special class of sources where the correlation length scales as the wavelength of light. We further study the cross correlations between two spatially distinct points that are generated due to propagation. It is found that such cross correlation leads to sufficiently strong spectral dependence of polarization which can be measured experimentally.
physics.optics:We demonstrate experimentally that in a centrosymmetric paraelectric non-stationary boundary conditions can dynamically halt the intrinsic instability of quasi-steady-state photorefractive self-trapping, driving beam evolution into a stable oscillating two-soliton-state configuration.
physics.optics:Mugnai et al. have reported an experiment in which microwave packets appear to travel in air with a speed substantially greater than c. They calculate the group velocity of their packets and find that it agrees with their experimental result. That calculation is incorrect. A correct calculation gives a group velocity less than c. The reported experimental result cannot be reconciled with the Maxwell equations.
physics.optics:Scalar Bessel beams are derived both via the wave equation and via diffraction theory. While such beams have a group velocity that exceeds the speed of light, this is a manifestation of the "scissors paradox" of special relativty. The signal velocity of a modulated Bessel beam is less than the speed of light. Forms of Bessel beams that satisfy Maxwell's equations are also given.
physics.optics:Various algebraic structures of degenerate four-wave mixing equations of optical phase conjugation are analyzed. Two approaches (the spinorial and the Lax-pair based), complementary to each other, are utilized for a systematic derivation of conserved quantities. Symmetry groups of both the equations and the conserved quantities are determined, and the corresponding generators are written down explicitly. Relation between these two symmetry groups is found. Conserved quantities enable the introduction of new methods for integration of the equations in the cases when the coupling $\Gamma$ is either purely real or purely imaginary. These methods allow for both geometries of the process, namely the transmission and the reflection, to be treated on an equal basis. One approach to introduction of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian structures for the 4WM systems is explored, and the obstacles in successful implementation of that programe are identified. In case of real coupling these obstacles are removable, and full Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of the initial system are possible.
physics.optics:Instead of using frequency dependent refractive index, we propose to use the extinction theorem to describe reflection and transmission of an ultrashort pulse passing through the boundary. When the duration of the pulse is comparable with the relaxation time, the results differ significantly from those given by the traditional method, especially if the carrier frequency is close to an absorbtion line. We compare the two approaches using the data of GaAs in the infrared domain.
physics.optics:The Classification of Polarization elements, the polarization affecting optical devices which have a Jones matrix representation, according to the types of eigenvectors they possess, is given a new visit through the Group-theoretical connection of polarization elements. The diattenuators and retarders are recognized as the elements corresponding to boosts and rotations respectively. The structure of homogeneous elements other than diattenuators and retarders are identified by giving the quaternion corresponding to these elements. The set of degenerate polarization elements is identified with the so called `null' elements of the Lorentz Group. Singular polarization elements are examined in their more illustrative Mueller matrix representation and finally the eigenstructure of a special class of singular Mueller matrices is studied.
physics.optics:Complex photonic band structures (CPBS) of transmission metallic gratings with rectangular slits are shown to exhibit strong discontinuities that are not evidenced in the usual energetic band structures. These discontinuities are located on Wood's anomalies and reveal unambiguously two different types of resonances, which are identified as horizontal and vertical surface-plasmon resonances. Spectral position and width of peaks in the transmission spectrum can be directly extracted from CPBS for both kinds of resonances.
physics.optics:We present a brief classical discussion of a process to reduce the group velocity of an electromagnetic pulse by many orders of magnitude.
physics.optics:The properties of pulse propagation in a nonlinear fiber including linear damped term added in the usual nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is analyzed analytically. We apply variational modified approach based on the lagrangian that describe the dynamic of system and with a trial function we obtain a solution which is more accuracy when compared with a pertubative solution. As a result, the problem of pulse propagation in a fiber with loss can be described in good agreement with exact results.
physics.optics:The group velocity for pulses in an optical medium can be negative at frequencies between those of a pair of laser-pumped spectral lines. The gain medium then can amplify the leading edge of a pulse resulting in a time advance of the pulse when it exits the medium, as has been recently demonstrated in the laboratory. This effect has been called superluminal, but, as a classical analysis shows, it cannot result in signal propgation at speeds greater than that of light in vacuum.
physics.optics:In two models it is shown that a light pulse propagates from a vacuum into certain media with velocity greater than that of a light in a vacuum (c). By numerical calculation the propagating properties of such a light are given.
physics.optics:The results of the study of ultra-short pulse generation in continuous-wave Kerr-lens mode-locked (KLM) solid-state lasers with semiconductor saturable absorbers are presented. The issues of extremely short pulse generation are addressed in the frames of the theory that accounts for the coherent nature of the absorber-pulse interaction. We developed an analytical model that bases on the coupled generalized Landau-Ginzburg laser equation and Bloch equations for a coherent absorber. We showed, that in the absence of KLM semiconductor absorber produces 2pi - non-sech-pulses of self-induced transparency, while the KLM provides an extremely short sech-shaped pulse generation. 2pi- and pi-sech-shaped solutions and variable-area chirped pulses have been found. It was shown, that the presence of KLM removes the limitation on the minimal modulation depth in absorber. An automudulational stability and self-starting ability were analyzed, too.
physics.optics:Based on self - consistent field theory we study a soliton generation in cw solid-state lasers with semiconductor saturable absorber. Various soliton destabilizations, i.e. the switch from femtosecond to picosecond generation (''picosecond collapse''), an automodulation regime, breakdown of soliton generation and hysteresis behavior, are predicted.
physics.optics:The effect of transmission of x-ray beams through submicron capillaries was investigated with account for diffraction and roughness scattering. Possible explanation of anomalous energy dependence of transmission through thin Cr/C/Cr channeles was given due to effect of periodic deformations.
physics.optics:Nonstationary pulse regimes associated with self modulation of a Kerr-lens modelocked Ti:sapphire laser have been studied experimentally and theoretically. Such laser regimes occur at an intracavity group delay dispersion that is smaller or larger than what is required for stable modelocking and exhibit modulation in pulse amplitude and spectra at frequencies of several hundred kHz. Stabilization of such modulations, leading to an increase in the pulse peak power by a factor of ten, were accomplished by weakly modulating the pump laser with the self-modulation frequency. The main experimental observations can be explained with a round trip model of the fs laser taking into account gain saturation, Kerr lensing, and second- and third-order dispersion.
physics.optics:The theoretical calculation for nonlinear refractive index in Cr: ZnSe - active medium predicts the strong defocusing cascaded second-order nonlinearity within 2000 - 3000 nm spectral range. On the basis of this result the optimal cavity configuration for Kerr-lens mode locking is proposed that allows to achieve a sub-100 fs pulse duration. The numerical simulations testify about strong destabilizing processes in the laser resulting from a strong self-phase modulation. The stabilization of the ultrashort pulse generation is possible due to spectral filtering that increases the pulse duration up to 300 fs.
physics.optics:The influence of nonlinear properties of semiconductor saturable absorbers on ultrashort pulse generation was investigated. It was shown, that linewidth enhancement, quadratic and linear ac Stark effect contribute essentially to the mode locking in cw solid-state lasers, that can increase the pulse stability, decrease pulse duration and reduce the mode locking threshold
physics.optics:We demonstrate that the shift of the stop band position with increasing oblique angle in periodic structures results in a wide transverse exponential field distribution corresponding to strong angular confinement of the radiation. The beam expansion follows an effective diffusive equation depending only upon the spectral mode width. In the presence of gain, the beam cross section is limited only by the size of the gain area. As an example of an active periodic photonic medium, we calculate and measure laser emission from a dye-doped cholesteric liquid crystal film.
physics.optics:The frequency of the Calcium ^3P_1--^1S_0 intercombination line at 657 nm is phase-coherently measured in terms of the output of a primary cesium frequency standard using an optical frequency comb generator comprising a sub-10 fs Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser and an external microstructure fiber for self-phase-modulation. The measured frequency of \nu_Ca = 455 986 240 494 276 Hz agrees within its relative uncertainty of 4 10^-13 with the values previously measured with a conceptually different harmonic frequency chain and with the value recommended for the realization of the SI unit of length.
physics.optics:Accurate phase-locked 3:1 division of an optical frequency was achieved, by using a continuous-wave (cw) doubly resonant optical parametric oscillator. A fractional frequency stability of 2*10^(-17) of the division process has been achieved for 100s integration time. The technique developed in this work can be generalized to the accurate phase and frequency control of any cw optical parametric oscillator.
physics.optics:It was usually assumed that the resonator based on a waveguide has the eigen oscillations that are formed by interference of two waves which propagate in different directions and have equal amplitudes. These patterns are usually called standing waves. We have shown that the eigen oscillations of a resonator which is filled by a layered dielectric can be base on the evanescent (non-propagating) waves. In some cases we need only one eigen wave to compose the eigen oscillation of a closed cavity.
physics.optics:The plane-wave dynamics of 3*omega => (2*omega, omega) subharmonic optical parametric oscillators containing a second harmonic generator of the idler wave omega is analyzed analytically by using the meanfield approximation and numerically by taking into account the field propagation inside the media. The resonant Chi(2):Chi(2) cascaded second-order nonlinearities induce a mutual injection-locking of the signal and idler waves that leads to coherent self phase-locking of the pump and subharmonic waves, freezing the phase diffusion noise. In case of signal-and-idler resonant devices, largely detuned sub-threshold states occur due to a subcritical bifurcation, broadening out the self-locking frequency range to a few cavity linewidths.
physics.optics:For the first time an all optical flip-flop is demonstrated based on two coupled Mach-Zehnder interferometers which contain semiconductor optical amplifiers in their arms. The flip-flop operation is discussed and it is demonstrated using commercially available fiber pigtailed devices. Being based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers, the flip-flop has potential for very high speed operation.
physics.optics:The strong asymmetry in charge distribution supporting a single non-interacting spatial needle soliton in a paraelectric photorefractive is directly observed by means of electroholographic readout. Whereas in trapping conditions a quasi-circular wave is supported, the underlying double-dipolar structure can be made to support two distinct propagation modes.
physics.optics:I present a theoretical treatment of parametric scattering in strong coupling semiconductor microcavities to model experiments in which parametric oscillator behaviour has been observed. The model consists of a non-linear excitonic oscillator coupled to a cavity mode which is driven by the external fields, and predicts the output power, below threshold gain and spectral blue shifts of the parametric oscillator. The predictions are found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data.
physics.optics:A number of factors that influence spectral position of the femtosecond pulse in a Kerr-lens modelocked Cr:LiSGaF laser have been identified: high-order dispersion, gain saturation, reabsorption from the ground state, and stimulated Raman scattering. Using the one-dimensional numerical model for the simulation of the laser cavity, the relative contributions of different factors have been compared. The Raman effect provides the largest self-frequency shift from the gain peak (up to 60 nm), followed by the gain saturation (25 nm), while the high-order dispersion contribution is insignificant (5 nm). Comparison with the experimental data confirm that the stimulated Raman scattering is a main cause of the ultrashort pulse self-frequency shift observed in Cr:LiSGaF and Cr:LiSAF lasers
physics.optics:Simultaneous measurements of the intensity and phase of a probe wave reflected from an interface between silica and elemental alpha-gallium reveal its very strong optical nonlinearity, affecting both these parameters of the reflected wave. The data corroborate with a non-thermal mechanism of optical response which assumes appearance of a homogeneous highly metallic layer, only a few nanometer thick, between the silica and bulk alpha-gallium.
physics.optics:We consider pulse propagation in a linear anomalously dispersive medium where the group velocity exceeds the speed of light in vacuum (c) or even becomes negative. A signal velocity is defined operationally based on the optical signal-to-noise ratio, and is computed for cases appropriate to the recent experiment where such a negative group velocity was observed. It is found that quantum fluctuations limit the signal velocity to values less than c.
physics.optics:Polarization dynamics of femtosecond light pulses propagating in air is studied by computer simulation. A rich variety of dynamics is found that depends on the initial polarization state and power of the pulse. Effects of polarization on the plasma and supercontinuum generation are also discussed.
physics.optics:We report measurements of thermal self-locking of a Fabry-Perot cavity containing a potassium niobate (KNbO3) crystal. We develop a method to determine linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients in intracavity crystals by detailed analysis of the transmission lineshapes. These lineshapes are typical of optical bistability in thermally loaded cavities. For our crystal, we determine the one-photon absorption coefficient at 846 nm to be (0.0034 \pm 0.0022) per m and the two-photon absorption coefficient at 846 nm to be (3.2 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-11} m/W and the one-photon absorption coefficient at 423 nm to be (13 \pm 2) per m. We also address the issue of blue-light-induced-infrared-absorption (BLIIRA), and determine a coefficient for this excited state absorption process. Our method is particularly well suited to bulk absorption measurements where absorption is small compared to scattering. We also report new measurements of the temperature dependence of the index of refraction at 846 nm, and compare to values in the literature.
physics.optics:We review and extend the analogies between Gaussian pulse propagation and Gaussian beam diffraction. In addition to the well-known parallels between pulse dispersion in optical fiber and CW beam diffraction in free space, we review temporal lenses as a way to describe nonlinearities in the propagation equations, and then introduce further concepts that permit the description of pulse evolution in more complicated systems. These include the temporal equivalent of a spherical dielectric interface, which is used by way of example to derive design parameters used in a recent dispersion-mapped soliton transmission experiment. Our formalism offers a quick, concise and powerful approach to analyzing a variety of linear and nonlinear pulse propagation phenomena in optical fibers.
physics.optics:We have measured the frequency of the $6s^2S_{1/2} - 5d^2D_{3/2}$ electric-quadrupole transition of $^{171}$Yb$^+$ with a relative uncertainty of $1\times 10^{-14}$, $\nu_{Yb}$ = 688 358 979 309 312 Hz $\pm$ 6 Hz. A femtosecond frequency comb generator was used to phase-coherently link the optical frequency derived from a single trapped ion to a cesium fountain controlled hydrogen maser. This measurement is one of the most accurate measurements of optical frequencies ever reported, and it represents a contribution to the development of optical clocks based on an $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ion standard.
physics.optics:The time behaviour of microwaves undergoing partial reflection by photonic barriers was measured in the time and in the frequency domain. It was observed that unlike the duration of partial reflection by dielectric layers, the measured reflection duration of barriers is independent of their length. The experimental results point to a nonlocal behaviour of evanescent modes at least over a distance of some ten wavelengths. Evanescent modes correspond to photonic tunnelling in quantum mechanics.
physics.optics:We study the conditions for soliton-like wave propagation in the Photorefractive (PR) and electro-optic (i.e., Pockels) material, by using Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. The complete NLS equation is solved analytically and numerically by transforming it into the phase space. Our results clearly show the existence of both the dark and bright solitary solutions for the PR medium. Interestingly, however, we find only one bright solitary solution in the Pockels case and there is no evidence of any dark solitary solution.
physics.optics:In the theory of optical gap solitons, slowly-moving finite-amplitude Lorentzian solutions are found to mediate the transition from bright to coexistent dark-antidark solitary wave pairs when the laser frequency is detuned out of the proper edge of a dynamical photonic bandgap. Catastrophe theory is applied to give a geometrical description of this strongly asymmetrical 'morphing' process.
physics.optics:Harmonic and Intermodulation distortions occur when a physical system is excited with a single or several frequencies and when the relationship between the input and output is non-linear. Working with non-linearities in the Frequency domain is not straightforward specially when the relationship between the input and output is not trivial. We outline the complete derivation of the Harmonic and Intermodulation distortions from basic principles to a general physical system. For illustration, the procedure is applied to the Single Mode laser diode where the relationship of input to output is non-trivial. The distortions terms are extracted directly from the Laser Diode rate equations and the method is tested by comparison to many results cited in the literature. This methodology is general enough to be applied to the extraction of distortion terms to any desired order in many physical systems in a general and systematic way.
physics.optics:We reelaborate on the basic properties of lossless multilayers. We show that the transfer matrices for these multilayers have essentially the same algebraic properties as the Lorentz group SO(2,1) in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, as well as the group SL(2,R) underlying the structure of the ABCD law in geometrical optics. By resorting to the Iwasawa decomposition, we represent the action of any multilayer as the product of three matrices of simple interpretation. This group-theoretical structure allows us to introduce bilinear transformations in the complex plane. The concept of multilayer transfer function naturally emerges and its corresponding properties in the unit disc are studied. We show that the Iwasawa decomposition reflects at this geometrical level in three simple actions that can be considered the basic pieces for a deeper undestanding of the multilayer behavior. We use the method to analyze in detail a simple practical example.
physics.optics:A method is presented to investigate diffraction of an electromagnetic plane wave by an infinitely thin infinitely conducting circular cylinder with longitudinal slots. It is based on the use of the combined boundary conditions method that consists on expressing the continuity of the tangential components of both the electric and the magnetic fields in a single equation. This method proves to be very efficient for this kind of problems and leads to fast numerical codes.
physics.optics:We present a reliable, narrow linewidth (100 kHz) continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator (OPO) suitable for high-resolution spectroscopy applications. The OPO is based on a periodically-poled lithium-niobate crystal and features a specially designed intracavity etalon which permits its continuous tuning and stable operation at any desired wavelength in a wide operation range. We demonstrate Doppler-free spectroscopy on a rovibrational transition of methane at 3.39 um.
physics.optics:We describe the action of a plane interface between two semi-infinite media in terms of a transfer matrix. We find a remarkably simple factorization of this matrix, which enables us to express the Fresnel coefficients as a hyperbolic rotation.
physics.optics:We report on a methodology for the evaluation of the DC characteristics, small-signal frequency response and large-signal dynamic response of carrier and photon density responses in semiconductor laser diodes. A single mode laser is considered and described with a pair of rate equations containing a novel non-linear gain compensation term depending on a single parameter that can be chosen arbitrarily. This approach can be applied to any type of solid-state laser as long as it is described by a set of rate equations.
physics.optics:We report the discovery of a "dark area theorem," a new quantum optical relation for propagation of unmatched pulses in thick three-level $\Lambda$-type media. We define dark area and derive the dark area theorem for a coherently prepared and inhomogeneously broadened lambda medium. We also obtain the first equation for the spatial evolution of the dark state amplitude prior to pulse-matching.
physics.optics:We propose experimentally simplified schemes of an optically dispersive interface region between two coupled free electron lasers (FELs), aimed at achieving a much broader gain bandwidth than in a conventional FEL or a conventional optical klystron composed of two separated FELs. The proposed schemes can {\it universally} enhance the gain of FELs, regardless of their design when operated in the short pulsed regime.
physics.optics:As a light beam is produced by an amplification of modes of the zero point field in its source, this field cannot be distinguished; consequently a nonlinear optical effect is a function of the total field. However, we generally prefer to use a conventional field which excludes the zero point field; for a low conventional field, the total field may be developed to the first order, so that the effect appears linear.   This nearly trivial remark allows a correct computation of the signal of a photocell used for photon counting and shows that the "impulsive stimulated Raman scattering" (ISRS), a nonlinear, without threshold effect, which shifts the frequencies, becomes linear at low light levels, so that the shifted spectra are not distorted.
physics.optics:The effect of thermal fluctuations in the resonance fluorescence of a three-level system is studied. The damped three-level system is driven by two strong incident classical fields near resonances frequencies. The simulation of a thermal bath is obtained with a large system of harmonic oscillators that represent the normal modes of the thermal radiation field. The time evolution of the fluorescent light intensities are obtained solving by a iterative method the Heisenberg equations of motion in the integral form. The results show that the time development of the intensity of the fluorescence light is strongly affected by the interaction of the system with the thermal bath.
physics.optics:The dynamical response of a relativistic bunch of electrons injected in a planar magnetic undulator and interacting with a counterpropagating electromagnetic wave is studied. We demonstrate a resonance condition for which the free electron laser (FEL) dynamics is strongly influenced by the presence of the external field. It opens up the possibility of control of short wavelength FEL emission characteristics by changing the parameters of the microwave field without requiring change in the undulator's geometry or configuration. Numerical examples, assuming realistic parameter values analogous to those of the TTF-FEL, currently under development at DESY, are given for possible control of the amplitude or the polarization of the emitted radiation.
physics.optics:We have operated a CW triply resonant OPO using a PPLN crystal pumped by a Nd:YAG laser at 1.06 micron and generating signal and idler modes in the 2-2.3 micron range. The OPO was operated stably in single mode operation over large periods of time with a pump threshold as low as 500 microwatts.
physics.optics:We extend a modal theory of diffraction by a set of parallel fibers to deal with the case of a hard boundary: that is a structure made for instance of air-holes inside a dielectric matrix. Numerical examples are given concerning some resonant phenomena.
physics.optics:We report observation of lasing in the scarred modes in an asymmetrically deformed microcavity made of liquid jet. The observed scarred modes correspond to morphology-dependent resonance of radial mode order 3 with their Q values in the range of 10^6. Emission directionality is also observed, corresponding to a hexagonal unstable periodic orbit.
physics.optics:We have demonstrated an ultrahigh-Q whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microsphere laser based on the evanescent-wave-coupled gain. Dye molecules outside the sphere near the equator were excited, resulting in WGM lasing in the lowest radial mode order. The loaded quality factor of the lasing WGM was 8(2)\times 10^9, the highest ever achieved in the microlaser.
physics.optics:An extended cavity diode laser operating in the Littrow configuration emitting near 657 nm is stabilized via its injection current to a reference cavity with a finesse of more than 10^5 and a corresponding resonance linewidth of 14 kHz. The laser linewidth is reduced from a few MHz to a value below 30 Hz. The compact and robust setup appears ideal for a portable optical frequency standard using the Calcium intercombination line.
physics.optics:We introduce a novel concept for optical frequency measurement and division which employs a Kerr-lens mode-locked laser as a transfer oscillator whose noise properties do not enter the measurement process. We experimentally demonstrate, that this method opens up the route to phase-link signals with arbitrary frequencies in the optical or microwave range while their frequency stability is preserved.
physics.optics:We investigate the self-phase modulation of intense femtosecond laser pulses propagating in an ionizing gas and its effects on collective properties of high-order harmonics generated in the medium. Plasmas produced in the medium are shown to induce a positive frequency chirp on the leading edge of the propagating laser pulse, which subsequently drives high harmonics to become positively chirped. In certain parameter regimes, the plasma-induced positive chirp can help to generate sharply peaked high harmonics, by compensating for the dynamically-induced negative chirp that is caused by the steep intensity profile of intense short laser pulses.
physics.optics:We developed a novel technique for frequency measurement and synthesis, based on the operation of a femtosecond comb generator as transfer oscillator. The technique can be used to measure frequency ratios of any optical signals throughout the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum. Relative uncertainties of $10^{-18}$ for averaging times of 100 s are possible. Using a Nd:YAG laser in combination with a nonlinear crystal we measured the frequency ratio of the second harmonic $\nu_{SH}$ at 532 nm to the fundamental $\nu_0$ at 1064 nm, $\nu_{SH}/\nu_0 = 2.000 000 000 000 000 001 \times (1 \pm 7 \times 10^{-19})$.
physics.optics:The mixed crystal of a para-dibromobenzene with a para-chloronitrobenzene is investigated at concentration of components from 0% up to 60% of a para-chloronitrobenzene by the method of Low-Frequency Raman spectroscopy. It is shown, that in range of concentrations from 25% up to 50% of a para-chloronitrobenzene the spectrum of the mixed crystal would consist of the sum of spectrums a and b phases which relation of intensities depends on concentration of components. It is also found, that the single crystal in this range has rod frame.
physics.optics:The stability of polarization, areas, and number of self-induced transparency (SIT)-solitons at the output from the LaF_3:Pr^{3+} crystal is theoretically studied versus the polarization direction and the area of the input linearly polarized laser pulse. For this purpose the Vector Area Theorem is rederived and two-dimensional Vector Area Theorem map is obtained. The map is governed by the crystal symmetry and takes into account directions of the dipole matrix element vectors of the different site subgroups of optically excited ions. The Vector Area Theorem mapping of the time evolution of the laser pulse allows one to highlight soliton polarization properties.
physics.optics:The dynamics of light in Fabry-Perot cavities with varying length and input laser frequency are analyzed and the exact condition for resonance is derived. This dynamic resonance depends on the light transit time in the cavity and the Doppler effect due to the mirror motions. The response of the cavity to length variations is very different from its response to laser frequency variations. If the frequency of these variations is equal to multiples of the cavity free spectral range, the response to length is maximized while the response to the laser frequency is zero. Implications of these results for the detection of gravitational waves using kilometer-scale Fabry-Perot cavities are discussed.
physics.optics:Numerical simulation of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) laser performance and automated control of the laser setup process are crucial to the project's success. These functions will be performed by two closely coupled computer code: the virtual beamline (VBL) and the laser performance operations model (LPOM).
physics.optics:Since its birth, the laser has been extraordinarily effective in the study and applications of laser-matter interaction at the atomic and molecular level and in the nonlinear optics of the bound electron. In its early life, the laser was associated with the physics of electron volts and of the chemical bond. Over the past fifteen years, however, we have seen a surge in our ability to produce high intensities, five to six orders of magnitude higher than was possible before. At these intensities, particles, electrons and protons, acquire kinetic energy in the mega-electron-volt range through interaction with intense laser fields. This opens a new age for the laser, the age of nonlinear relativistic optics coupling even with nuclear physics. We suggest a path to reach an extremely high-intensity level $10^{26-28} $W/cm$^2$ in the coming decade, much beyond the current and near future intensity regime $10^{23} $W/cm$^2$, taking advantage of the megajoule laser facilities. Such a laser at extreme high intensity could accelerate particles to frontiers of high energy, tera-electron-volt and peta-electron-volt, and would become a tool of fundamental physics encompassing particle physics, gravitational physics, nonlinear field theory, ultrahigh-pressure physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. We focus our attention on high-energy applications in particular and the possibility of merged reinforcement of high-energy physics and ultraintense laser.
physics.optics:A simple and intuitive geometical method to analyze Fresnel formulas is presented. It applies to transparent media and is valid for perpendicular and parallel polarizations. The approach gives a graphical characterization particularly simple of the critical and Brewster angles. It also provides an interpretation of the relation between the reflection coefficients for both basic polarizations as a symmetry in the plane.
physics.optics:The tunnel effect is considered here within the framework of electromagnetic propagation. The classical problem of a plane gap of dielectric, surrounded on both sides by a medium with larger refraction index, is studied in the case in which an electromagnetic plane wave impinges into the gap with an incidence angle larger than the critical angle. In this condition (total reflection), the gap acts as a classically forbidden region and behaves like a tunnel. The field inside the forbidden gap consists of two evanescent waves, each one having its wavefronts normal to the interface. In the present paper we study the total field derived as a superposition of two such evanescent waves, its wavefronts, and the directions of propagation of both phase and energy.
physics.optics:The motion of an electromagnetic wave, through a classically-forbidden region, has recently attracted renewed interest because of its implication with regard to the theoretical and experimental problems of superluminality. From an experimental point of view, many papers provide an evidence of superluminality in different physical systems. Theoretically, the problem of a passage through a forbidden gap has been treated by considering plane waves at oblique incidence into a plane parallel layer of a medium with a refractive index smaller than the index of the surrounding medium, and also confined (Gaussian) beams, still at oblique incidence. In the present paper the case of a Bessel beam is examined, at normal incidence into the layer (Secs. II and III), in the scalar approximation (Sec. IV) and by developing also a vectorial treatment (Sec. V). Conclusions are reported in Sic. VI.
physics.optics:The tunneling time is here investigated by means of an electromagnetic model, for a system where a gap, between two parallel planes, acts as a classically-forbidden region for an impinging pulse with incidence angle larger than the critical angle. In all cases of frustrated total reflection we obtain a superluminal behavior both for phase and group delays.
physics.optics:We report an injection-locked cw titanium:sapphire ring laser at 846 nm. It produces 1.00 W in a single frequency when pumped with 5.5 W. Single frequency operation requires only a few milliwatts of injected power.
physics.optics:Accurate knowledge of absorption coefficient of a sample is a prerequisite for measuring the third order optical nonlinearity of materials, which could become a serious limitation for unknown samples. We introduce a new method, which measures both the absorption coefficient and the third order optical nonlinearity of materials with high sensitivity in a single experimental setup. We use a dual-beam pump-probe experiment under different conditions to achieve this goal. We also demonstrate a counterintuitive coupling of the non-interacting probe-beam with the pump-beam in pump-probe z-scan experiment.
physics.optics:We obtain gain of the probe field at multiple frequencies in a closed three-level V-type system using frequency modulated pump field. There is no associated population inversion among the atomic states of the probe transition. We describe both the steady-state and transient dynamics of this system. Under suitable conditions, the system exhibits large gain simultaneously at series of frequencies far removed from resonance. Moreover, the system can be tailored to exhibit multiple frequency regimes where the probe experiences anomalous dispersion accompanied by negligible gain-absorption over a large bandwidth, a desirable feature for obtaining superluminal propagation of pulses with negligible distortion.
physics.optics:An undoped double quantum well (DQW) was driven with a terahertz (THz) electric field of frequency \omega_{THz} polarized in the growth direction, while simultaneously illuminated with a near-infrared (NIR) laser at frequency \omega_{NIR}. The intensity of NIR upconverted sidebands \omega_{sideband}=\omega_{NIR} + \omega_{THz} was maximized when a dc voltage applied in the growth direction tuned the excitonic states into resonance with both the THz and NIR fields. There was no detectable upconversion far from resonance. The results demonstrate the possibility of using gated DQW devices for all-optical wavelength shifting between optical communication channels separated by up to a few THz.
physics.optics:Driving a double-quantum-well excitonic intersubband resonance with a terahertz (THz) electric field of frequency \omega_{THz} generated terahertz optical sidebands \omega=\omega_{THz}+\omega_{NIR} on a weak NIR probe. At high THz intensities, the intersubband dipole energy which coupled two excitons was comparable to the THz photon energy. In this strong-field regime the sideband intensity displayed a non-monotonic dependence on the THz field strength. The oscillating refractive index which gives rise to the sidebands may be understood by the formation of Floquet states, which oscillate with the same periodicity as the driving THz field.
physics.optics:We elaborate on the consequences of the factorization of the transfer matrix of any lossless multilayer in terms of three basic matrices of simple interpretation. By considering the bilinear transformation that this transfer matrix induces in the complex plane, we introduce the concept of multilayer transfer function and study its properties in the unit disk. In this geometrical setting, our factorization translates into three actions that can be viewed as the basic pieces for understanding the multilayer behavior. Additionally, we introduce a simple trace criterion that allows us to classify multilayers in three types with properties closely related to one (and only one) of these three basic matrices. We apply this approach to analyze some practical examples that are representative of these types of matrices.
physics.optics:We consider the problem of radiation into free space from the end-facet of a single-mode photonic crystal fiber (PCF). We calculate the numerical aperture NA=sin theta from the half-divergence angle theta ~ tan^{-1}(lambda/pi w) with pi w^2 being the effective area of the mode in the PCF. For the fiber first presented by Knight et al. we find a numerical aperture NA ~ 0.07 which compares to standard fiber technology. We also study the effect of different hole sizes and demonstrate that the PCF technology provides a large freedom for NA-engineering. Comparing to experiments we find good agreement.
physics.optics:Polarized and azimuthal dependencies of optical second harmonics generation (SHG) at the surface of noncentrosymmetric semiconductor crystals have been measured on polished surfaces of ZnSe(100), using a fundamental wavelength of 1.06$\mu m$. The SHG intensity patterns were analyzed for all four combination of p- and s-polarized incidence and output, considering both the bulk and surface optical nonlinearities in the electric dipole approximation. We found that the measurement using $S_{in}-S_{out}$ is particularly useful in determining the symmetry of the oxdized layer interface, which would lower the effective symmetry of the surface from $C_{4v}$ to $C_{2v}.$ We also have shown that the [011] and [0$\bar{1}$1] directions can be distinguished through the analysis of p-incident and p-output confugration.
physics.optics:Fundamental rules and definitions of Fractional Differintegrals are outlined. Factorizing 1-D and 2-D Helmholtz equations four fractional eigenfunctions are determined. The functions exhibit incident and reflected plane waves as well as diffracted incident and reflected waves of the half-plane edge. They allow to construct the Sommerfeld half-plane diffraction solutions. Parabolic-Wave Equation (PWE, Leontovich-Fock) for paraxial propagation is factorized and differetial fractional solutions of Fresnel-integral type are derived. We arrived at two solutions, which are the mothers of known and new solutions.
physics.optics:In the classical theory, an electromagnetic field obeying Maxwell's equations cannot be absorbed quickly by matter, so that it remains a zero point field. Splitting the total, genuine electromagnetic field into the sum of a conventional field and a zero point field is physically meaningless until a receiver attenuates the genuine field down to the zero point field, or studying the amplification of the zero point field by a source.   In classical optics all optical effects must be written using the genuine field, so that at low light levels the nonlinear effects become linear in relation to the conventional field. The result of the interpretation of all observations, even at low light levels, is exactly the same in quantum electrodynamics and in the semi- classical theory.   The zero point field is stochastic only far from the sources and the receivers; elsewhere, it is shaped by matter, it may be studied through fields visible before an absorption or after an amplification.   A classical study of the reduction of the wave packet extends the domain of equivalence of the classical and quantum zero point field; using both interpretations of this field makes the results more reliable, because the traps are different.
physics.optics:The smaller the size of a light-emitting microcavity, the more important it becomes to understand the effects of the cavity boundary on the optical mode profile. Conventional methods of laser physics, such as the paraxial approximation, become inapplicable in many of the more exotic cavity designs to be discussed here. Cavities in the shape of microdisks, pillars and rings can yield low lasing thresholds in a wide variety of gain media: quantum wells, wires and even dots, as well as quantum cascade superlattices and GaN. An overview of the experimental and theoretical status is provided, with special emphasis on the light extraction problem.
physics.optics:The stationary states of a microlaser are related to the decaying quasibound states of the corresponding passive cavity. These are interpreted classically as originating from sequential escape attempts of an ensemble of rays obeying a curvature-corrected Fresnel formula. Polarization-dependent predictions of this model, and its limitations for stable orbits in partially chaotic systems are discussed.
physics.optics:We measured and calculated transmission spectra of two-dimensional quasiperiodic photonic crystals (PCs) based on a 5-fold (Penrose) or 8-fold (octagonal) symmetric quasiperiodic pattern. The photonic crystal consisted of dielectric cylindrical rods in air placed normal to the basal plane on vertices of tiles composing the quasiperiodic pattern. An isotropic photonic band gap (PBG) appeared in the TM mode, where electric fields were parallel to the rods, even when the real part of a dielectric constant of the rod was as small as 2.4. An isotropic PBG-like dip was seen in tiny Penrose and octagonal PCs with only 6 and 9 rods, respectively. These results indicate that local multiple light scattering within the tiny PC plays an important role in the PBG formation. Besides the isotropic PBG, we found dips depending on the incident angle of the light. This is the first report of anisotropic structures clearly observed in transmission spectra of quasiperiodic PCs. Based on rod-number and rod-arrangement dependence, it is thought that the shapes and positions of the anisotropic dips are determined by global multiple light scattering covering the whole system. In contrast to the isotropic PBG due to local light scattering, we could not find any PBGs due to global light scattering even though we studied transmission spectra of a huge Penrose PC with 466 rods.
physics.optics:A perfect focus telescope is one in which all rays parallel to the axis meet at a point and give equal magnification there. It is shown that these two conditions define the shapes of both primary and secondary mirrors. Apart from scale, the solution depends upon two parameters, $s$, which gives the mirror separation in terms of the effective focal length, and $K$, which gives the relative position of the final focus in that unit. The two conditions ensure that the optical systems have neither spherical aberration nor coma, no matter how fast the $f$ ratio. All known coma--free systems emerge as approximate special cases. In his classical paper, K. Schwarzschild studied all two mirror systems whose profiles were conic sections. We make no such a priori shape conditions but demand a perfect focus and solve for the mirrors' shapes.
physics.optics:The results of experimental testing the existence of intense Lorentzian--like wings with FWHM $\sim 4.5 cm^{-1}$ in the absorption spectra of polyatomic molecules in a gas phase are presented. Two independent experimental methods were used for evaluating the integral intensity of the line wings for a number of substances. In the first case, the cross--section of the far wings of absorption bands in a gas phase spectrum were measured. Then, these band wings were extrapolated inside the contour of absorption band. In the second case, the saturation degree of the linear spectrum of molecules was determined. Radiation of a pulsed $CO_2$--laser was used at low gas pressure ($\sim 16$ mtorr) and averaged excitation level of molecules ${<n>}\sim 0.1$ quanta/molecule. The values obtained by these two independent methods coincide for a variety of molecules. The average relative integral intensity of the line wings varied from $\sim 0.6%$ for $SF_6$ and $SiF_4$ to $\sim 90%$ for $(CF_3)_2O$ and $(CF_3)_2CO$.
physics.optics:It is shown that the direct Fourier synthesization of light beams allows one to create polarity-asymmetric waves, which are able, in the process of nonlinear interaction with a medium, to break its inversion symmetry. As a result, these "polar" waves may show the effect of optical rectification in nonlinear centrosymmetric media by generating light-induced dc electric polarization. At the same time, the waves of this type, due to their unusual symmetry properties, can be used for detecting the direction and sign of a dc electric field applied to the medium. The prospects of application of polar waves to data recording and processing are discussed.
physics.optics:Presented is an analysis of general scaling perturbations in a transmitting fiber. For elliptical perturbations, under some conditions an intermode dispersion parameter characterizing modal PMD is shown to be directly proportional to the mode dispersion.
physics.optics:Extensive Bose-Einstein condensation research activities have recently led to studies of fermionic atoms and optical confinements. Here we present a case of micro-optical fermionic electron phase transition. Optically confined ordering and phase transitions of a fermionic cloud in dynamic steady state are associated with Rayleigh emissions from photonic quantum ring manifold which are generated by nature without any ring lithography. The whispering gallery modes, produced in a semiconductor Rayleigh-Fabry-Perot toroidal cavity at room temperature, exhibit novel properties of ultralow thresholds open to nano-ampere regime, thermal stabilities from square-root-T-dependent spectral shift, and angularly varying intermode spacings. The photonic quantum ring phenomena are associated with a photonic field-driven phase transition of quantum-well-to-quantum-wire and hence the photonic (non-de Broglie) quantum corral effect on the Rayleigh cavity-confined carriers in dynamic steady state. Based upon the intra-cavity fermionic condensation we also offer a prospect for an electrically driven few-quantum dot single photon source from the photonic quantum ring laser for quantum information processors.
physics.optics:Nonlinear optical media that are normally dispersive, support a new type of localized (nondiffractive and nondispersive) wavepackets that are X-shaped in space and time and have slower than exponential decay. High-intensity X-waves, unlike linear ones, can be formed spontaneously through a trigger mechanism of conical emission, thus playing an important role in experiments.
physics.optics:We report three-dimensional laser microfabrication, which enables microstructuring of materials on the scale of 0.2-1 micrometers. The two different types of microfabrication demonstrated and discussed in this work are based on holographic recording, and light-induced damage in transparent dielectric materials. Both techniques use nonlinear optical excitation of materials by ultrashort laser pulses (duration < 1 ps).
physics.optics:We propose a concept for production of high power coherent attosecond pulses in X-ray range. An approach is based on generation of 8th harmonic of radiation in a multistage HGHG FEL (high gain high harmonic free electron laser) configuration starting from shot noise. Single-spike phenomena occurs when electron bunch is passed through the sequence of four relatively short undulators. The first stage is a conventional "long" wavelength (0.8 nm) SASE FEL which operates in the high-gain linear regime. The 0.1 nm wavelength range is reached by successive multiplication (0.8 nm $\to$ 0.4 nm $\to$ 0.2 nm $\to$ 0.1 nm) in a stage sequence. Our study shows that the statistical properties of the high-harmonic radiation from the SASE FEL, operating in linear regime, can be used for selection of radiation pulses with a single spike in time domain. The duration of the spikes is in attosecond range. Selection of single-spike high-harmonic pulses is achieved by using a special trigger in data acquisition system. The potential of X-ray SASE FEL at TESLA at DESY for generating attosecond pulses is demonstrated. Since the design of XFEL laboratory at TESLA is based on the use of long SASE undulators with tunable gap, no special place nor additional FEL undulators are required for attophysics experiments. The use of a 10 GW-level attosecond X-ray pulses at X-ray SASE FEL facility will enable us to track processes inside atoms.
physics.optics:We present an algorithm for the maximization of photonic bandgaps in two-dimensional crystals. Once the translational symmetries of the underlying structure have been imposed, our algorithm finds a global maximal (and complete, if one exists) bandgap. Additionally, we prove two remarkable results related to maximal bandgaps: the so-called `maximum contrast' rule, and about the location in the Brillouin zone of band edges.
physics.optics:We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in finite photonic band gap structures. We analyze the phenomenon of conduction and forbidden bands and we show that two regimes are to be distinguished with respect to the existence of a strong field near the interfaces. We precise the domain for which an effective medium theory is sounded.
physics.optics:The maximum bit-rate of a slab waveguide is ultimately determined by the waveguide dispersion. We show that while the maximum bit rate in a waveguide is inversely proportional to the waveguide's width, bit rate per unit width (i.e., spatial capacity) decreases, and in the limit of a zero-width waveguide it converges to a value, which is independent of the waveguide's refractive indices. This value is qualitatively equivalent to the transmission rate per unit of width in free space. We also show that in a 3D waveguide (e.g., fibers), unlike free space, the spatial capacity vanishes in the same limit.
physics.optics:The photonic band dispersion and density of states (DOS) are calculated for the three-dimensional (3D) hexagonal structure corresponding to a distributed Bragg reflector patterned with a 2D triangular lattice of circular holes. Results for the Si/SiO$_2$ and GaAs/AlGaAs systems determine the optimal parameters for which a gap in the 2D plane occurs and overlaps the 1D gap of the multilayer. The DOS is considerably reduced in correspondence with the overlap of 2D and 1D gaps. Also, the local density of states (i.e., the DOS weighted with the squared electric field at a given point) has strong variations depending on the position. Both results imply substantial changes of spontaneous emission rates and patterns for a local emitter embedded in the structure and make this system attractive for the fabrication of a 3D photonic crystal with controlled radiative properties.
physics.optics:We present a Fourier transform methodology for all-order polarization mode dispersion (PMD) analysis, based on the first Born approximation to the coupled-mode equation solution. Our method predicts wavelength-dependent PMD effects and allows design of filters for their mitigation.
physics.optics:We demonstrate the combination of a hemispherical solid immersion lens with a micro-photoluminescence setup. Two advantages introduced by the SIL, an improved resolution of 0.4 times the wavelength in vacuum and a 5 times enhancement of the collection efficiency, make it an ideal system for spatially resolved spectroscopy applications. The influence of the air gap between the SIL and the sample surface is investigated in detail. We confirm the tolerance of the set--up to an air gap of several micrometers. Such a system is proven to be ideal system in the studies of exciton transport and polarization dependent single quantum dot spectroscopy.
physics.optics:It is assumed, that the clumps of lines do not connected with states mixing and IVR, but they are the result of breaking (destruction) of the process of averaging of momentum of inertia of molecules during the vibration motion of atoms. Rough estimates of the widths of clumps of lines in absorption spectra of some acetylenic derivatives were made with this model. Obtained results are in a satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data. This idea allows also in principle to explain the origin of intensive wings of lines, the existence of which was discussed earlier.
physics.optics:The origin of the Kerr type nonlinearity of the medium as a result of the interaction between photons via the Dirac delta-potential is presented in the formalism adopted from the photon wave function approach. In the view of the result the optical soliton may be treated as a bound state (cluster) of many photons.
physics.optics:The propagation of photon in a dielectric may be described with the help of the scalar and vector potentials of the medium. The main novelty of the paper is that the concept of the vector potential (which is connected with the velocity of the medium) can be extended to relativistic velocities of the medium. The position-dependent photon wave function was used to describe the propagation of the photon. The new concepts of the velocity of photon as particle and the photon mass in the dielectric medium were proposed.
physics.optics:Mathematical aspects of the SU(1,1) group parameter x dynamics governed by Hamiltonians exhibiting some special types of time dependence has been presented on an elementary level from the point of view of Moebius transformation of complex plane. The trajectories of x in continuous and mappings in discrete dynamics are considered. Some simple examples have been examined. Analytical considerations and numerical results have been given.
physics.optics:Propagation of the TE electromagnetic waves in self-focusing medium is governed by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. In this paper the stationary solutions of this equation have been systematically presented. The phase-plane method, qualitative analysis, and mechanical interpretation of the differential equations are widely used. It is well known that TE waves can be guided by the single interface between two semi-infinite media, providing that one of the media has a self-focusing (Kerr type) nonlinearity. This special solution is called a spatial soliton. In this paper our interests are not restricted to the soliton solutions. In the context of the nonlinear substrate and cladding we have found solutions which could be useful to describe also the incident light in nonlinear medium. This result is the main point of the paper. Some of the presented stationary solutions were already used in similar optical context in literature but we show a little wider class of solutions. In the last section we review and illustrate some results concerning the spatial soliton solution.
physics.optics:We present angle- and polarization-resolved measurements of the optical transmission of a subwavelength hole array. These results give a (far-field) visualization of the corresponding (near-field) propagation of the excited surface plasmons and allow for a simple analysis of their polarization properties.
physics.optics:A monochromatic linear source of light is rotated with certain angular frequency and when such light is analysed after reflection then a change of frequency or wavelength may be observed depending on the location of the observer. This change of frequency or wavelength is different from the classical Doppler effect [1] or relativistic Doppler effect [2]. The reason behind this shift in wavelength is that a certain time interval observed by an observer in the rotating frame is different from that of a stationary observer.
physics.optics:We investigate the spectral response of a Brillouin amplifier in the frequency regime within the SBS bandwidth. This is done by amplitude modulating the pump with a low frequency, and therefore, unlike previous studies, the spectrum of the modulated pump is, in all cases, smaller than the SBS bandwidth. We show both theoretically and experimentally that unlike phase modulation, which was reported in the literature, the amplitude modulation increases the Brillouin amplifier gain, and that this effect has a very narrow bandwidth. Only modulation frequencies that are lower than a certain cut-off frequency increase the gain. This cut-off frequency is inversely proportional to the fiber's length, and can therefore be arbitrarily small.
physics.optics:The Phase Diverse Speckle (PDS) problem is formulated mathematically as Multi Frame Blind Deconvolution (MFBD) together with a set of Linear Equality Constraints (LECs) on the wavefront expansion parameters. This MFBD-LEC formulation is quite general and, in addition to PDS, it allows the same code to handle a variety of different data collection schemes specified as data, the LECs, rather than in the code. It also relieves us from having to derive new expressions for the gradient of the wavefront parameter vector for each type of data set. The idea is first presented with a simple formulation that accommodates Phase Diversity, Phase Diverse Speckle, and Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing. Then various generalizations are discussed, that allows many other types of data sets to be handled.
physics.optics:A Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to track light rays in cylindrical fibres by ray optics. The trapping efficiencies for skew and meridional rays in active fibres and distributions of characteristic quantities for all trapped light rays have been calculated. The simulation provides new results for curved fibres, where the analytical expressions are too complex to be solved. The light losses due to sharp bending of fibres are presented as a function of the ratio of curvature to fibre radius and bending angle. It is shown that a radius of curvature to fibre radius ratio of greater than 65 results in a loss of less than 10% with the loss occuring in the initial stage of the bend (at bending angles Phi circa pi/8 rad).
physics.optics:We have measured the photonic bandgap in the transmission of microwaves through a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab. The structure was constructed by cementing acrylic rods in a hexagonal closed-packed array to form rectangular stacks. We find a bandgap centered at approximately 11 GHz, whose depth, width and center frequency vary with the number of layers in the slab, angle of incidence and microwave polarization.
physics.optics:We study forward stimulated Raman emission from weakly fluorescent dye 4'-diethylamino-N-methyl-4-stilbazolium tosylate (DEST) in 1,2,dichloroethane solution excited by a 28 ps, 532 nm Nd: YAG laser. Neat 1, 2, dichloroethane emits the first Stokes line at 631 nm with a spectral width of 1.6 nm corresponding to a Raman shift of 2956 per cm. We observe reduction of spectral width with the addition of DEST in 1, 2, dichloroethane solution. The single pass conversion efficiency for forward Raman emission is as high as 20 percent in a 1 cm path length sample. The pulse duration of forward stimulated Raman emission measured by a third order autocorrelation technique is 10 ps in neat 1, 2, dichloroethane, whereas it is nearly 3 ps for 0.04 mM of DEST solution.
physics.optics:Distribution of centrosymmetrical molecules of an impurity (p-diclorobenzene) in monocrystals of solid solutions in two different matrixes with centrosymmetrical (p-dibrombenzene) and noncentrosymmetrical (p-bromchlorbenzene) molecules by the method of a Raman Effect is determined.
physics.optics:We demonstrate that twisting one part of a chiral photonic structure about its helical axis produces a single circularly polarized localized mode that gives rise to an anomalous crossover in propagation. Up to a crossover thickness, this defect results in a peak in transmission and exponential scaling of the linewidth for a circularly polarized wave with the same handedness as structure. Above the crossover, however, the linewidth saturates and the defect mode can be excited only by the oppositely polarized wave, resulting in a peak in reflection instead of transmission.
physics.optics:We study experimentally and theoretically the polarization alternation during the switch-on transient of a quasi-isotropic CO$_2$ laser emitting on the fundamental mode. The observed transient dynamics is well reproduced by means of a model which provides a quantitative discrimination between the intrinsic asymmetry due to the kinetic coupling of molecules with different angular momenta, and the extrinsic anisotropies, due to a tilted intracavity window. Furthermore, the experiment provides a numerical assignment for the decay rate of the coherence term for a CO$_2$ laser.
physics.optics:In this paper we present an analysis of information transfer time based on holomorphism, causality and the classical principle of stationary phase. We also make a preliminary study of the effect of noise on information transfer time, and find that noise tends to increase transfer times. Noise and information signals are both essentially acausal, such that analytic continuation (i.e. prediction) is impossible, which also implies that their frequency spectra cannot be holomorphic. This leads to the paradox of a non-holomorphic information-bearing light signal, yet whose underlying Maxwell equations governing the propagation of the EM wave describe a holomorphic function in spacetime. We find that application of stationary phase and entropy arguments circumvents this difficulty, with stationary phase only suggesting the most likely transfer times of an information signal in the presence of noise. Faster transit times are not excluded, but are highly improbable. Stationary phase solutions, by definition, do not include signal forerunners, whose detection in the presence of noise is also unreliable. Hence a finite information capacity ensues, as expected from Shannon's law, and information cannot be transferred faster than c. We also find that the method of stationary phase implies complex transfer times. However, by considering spacetime to be isomorphic with the complex temporal plane, we find that an imaginary time is equivalent to a real distance, and can be interpreted as the uncertainty in the spatial position of the information pulse. Finally, we apply our theory to a photonic band gap crystal, and find that information transfer speed and tunneling is always subluminal.
physics.optics:Enhancement of optical Kerr nonlinearity for self-action by electro-magnetically induced transparency in a four-level atomic system including dephasing between the ground states is studied in detail by solving the density matrix equations for the atomic levels. We discern three major contributions, from energy shifts of the ground states induced by the probe light, to the third-order susceptibility in the four-level system. In this four-level system with the frequency-degenerate probes, quantum interference amongst the three contributions can, not only enhance the third-order susceptibility more effectively than in the three-level system with the same characteristic parameters, but also make the ratio between its real and imaginary part controllable. Due to dephasing between the two ground states and constructive quantum interference, the most effective enhancement generally occurs at an offset that is determined by the atomic transition frequency difference and the coupling Rabi frequency.
physics.optics:We numerically study supercontinuum (SC) generation in photonic crystal fibers pumped with low-power 30-ps pulses close to the zero dispersion wavelength 647nm. We show how the efficiency is significantly improved by designing the dispersion to allow widely separated spectral lines generated by degenerate four-wave-mixing (FWM) directly from the pump to broaden and merge. By proper modification of the dispersion profile the generation of additional FWM Stokes and anti-Stokes lines results in efficient generation of an 800nm wide SC. Simulations show that the predicted efficient SC generation is more robust and can survive fiber imperfections modelled as random fluctuations of the dispersion coefficients along the fiber length.
physics.optics:We numerically study the possibilities for improved large-mode area endlessly single mode photonic crystal fibers for use in high-power delivery applications. By carefully choosing the optimal hole diameter we find that a triangular core formed by three missing neighboring air holes considerably improves the mode area and loss properties compared to the case with a core formed by one missing air hole. In a realized fiber we demonstrate an enhancement of the mode area by ~30 % without a corresponding increase in the attenuation.
physics.optics:A new type of perturbative expansion is built in order to give a rigorous derivation and to clarify the range of validity of some commonly used model equations.   This model describes the evolution of the modulation of two short and localized pulses, fundamental and second harmonic, propagating together in a bulk uniaxial crystal with non-vanishing second order susceptibility $\chi^(2)$ and interacting through the nonlinear effect known as ``cascading'' in nonlinear optics.   The perturbative method mixes a multi-scale expansion with a power series expansion of the susceptibility, and must be carefully adapted to the physical situation. It allows the determination of the physical conditions under which the model is valid: the order of magnitude of the walk-off, phase-mismatch,and anisotropy must have determined values.
physics.optics:Nonlinear phase noise, often called the Gordon-Mollenauer effect, can be compensated electronically by subtracting from the received phase a correction proportional to the received intensity. The optimal scaling factor is derived analytically and found to be approximately equal to half of the ratio of mean nonlinear phase noise and the mean received intensity. Using optimal compensation, the standard deviation of residual phase noise is halved, doubling the transmission distance in systems limited by nonlinear phase noise.
physics.optics:On the basis of the data given in the works of different authors a criterion of phase-photometric method of measurement of energy angle of divergence has been formulated. Validity of application of the obtained relations for a ray beam with an arbitrary diameter and an arbitrary shape of the wave front has been proved. Advantages of the proposed phase-photometric method in comparison with the focal-spot method have been confirmed. Necessity and possibility of building a standard solid angle has been proved.
physics.optics:This document contains my detailed calculation of the Generalised Few-cycle Envelope Approximation (GFEA) propagation equation reported and used in Phys. Rev. A (submitted) and its associated longer version at arXiv.org. This GFEA propagation equation is intended to be applicable to optical pulses only a few cycles long, a regime where the standard Slowly Varying Envelope Approximation (SVEA) fails.
physics.optics:We present a comprehensive framework for treating the nonlinear interaction of few-cycle pulses using an envelope description that goes beyond the traditional SVEA method. This is applied to a range of simulations that demonstrate how the effect of a $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity differs between the many-cycle and few-cycle cases. Our approach, which includes diffraction, dispersion, multiple fields, and a wide range of nonlinearities, builds upon the work of Brabec and Krausz[1] and Porras[2]. No approximations are made until the final stage when a particular problem is considered.   The original version (v1) of this arXiv paper is close to the published Phys.Rev.A. version, and much smaller in size.
physics.optics:Broadband noise on supercontinuum spectra generated in microstructure fiber is shown to lead to amplitude fluctuations as large as 50 % for certain input laser pulse parameters. We study this noise using both experimental measurements and numerical simulations with a generalized stochastic nonlinear Schroedinger equation, finding good quantitative agreement over a range of input pulse energies and chirp values. This noise is shown to arise from nonlinear amplification of two quantum noise inputs: the input pulse shot noise and the spontaneous Raman scattering down the fiber.
physics.optics:The probability density function of Kerr effect phase noise, often called the Gordon-Mollenauer effect, is derived analytically. The Kerr effect phase noise can be accurately modeled as the summation of a Gaussian random variable and a noncentral chi-square random variable with two degrees of freedom. Using the received intensity to correct for the phase noise, the residual Kerr effect phase noise can be modeled as the summation of a Gaussian random variable and the difference of two noncentral chi-square random variables with two degrees of freedom. The residual phase noise can be approximated by Gaussian distribution better than the Kerr effect phase noise without correction.
physics.optics:Steady-state and dynamics of the self-phase-locked (3\omega ==> 2\omega, \omega) subharmonic optical parametric oscillator are analyzed in the pump-and-signal resonant configuration, using an approximate analytical model and a full propagation model. The upper branch solutions are found always stable, regardless of the degree of pump enhancement. The domain of existence of stationary states is found to critically depend on the phase-mismatch of the competing second-harmonic process.
physics.optics:In the present paper we investigate the transmission and reflection band behavior for a plane electromagnetic wave falling obliquely on an ideal layered structure. The dependence of this behavior on the problem parameters and wave incident angle is considered. It is shown, that in general case the band width is a non-monotonous function of the problem parameters. A condition is found, which defines the possibility of the contact of the transmission bands. This condition has the same form for s and p waves. It is also shown that irrespective of the wave polarization, the transmission coefficient equals to the unit at the contact points.
physics.optics:The problem of determination of the maximum of second harmonic generation in the potential well containing a rectangular barrier is considered. It is shown that, in general, the problem of finding the ensemble of structures with equidistant first three levels has two types of solutions.   For the first type the second and third energy levels are located above a rectangular barrier, and for the second type the third level is located above the barrier only. It is also shown, that generation corresponding to the second type of solution always is less than generation for the first one. Taking into account the effective mass changes the problem of finding the generation maximum for a finite depth well is exactly solved.
physics.optics:We investigate numerically optical properties of novel two-dimensional photonic materials where parallel dielectric rods are randomly placed with the restriction that the distance between rods is larger than a certain value. A large complete photonic gap (PG) is found when rods have sufficient density and dielectric contrast. Our result shows that neither long-range nor short-range order is an essential prerequisite to the formation of PGs. A universal principle is proposed for designing arbitrarily shaped waveguides, where waveguides are fenced with side walls of periodic rods and surrounded by the novel photonic materials. We observe highly efficient transmission of light for various waveguides. Due to structural uniformity, the novel photonic materials are best suited for filling up the outer region of waveguides of arbitrary shape and dimension comparable with the wavelength.
physics.optics:We suggest an effective method for controlling nonlinear switching in arrays of weakly coupled optical waveguides. We demonstrate the digitized switching of a narrow input beam for up to eleven waveguides in the engineered waveguide arrays.
physics.optics:Plane waves in Kerr media spontaneously generate paraxial X-waves (i.e. non-dispersive and non-diffractive pulsed beams) that get amplified along propagation. This effect can be considered a form of conical emission (i.e. spatio-temporal modulational instability), and can be used as a key for the interpretation of the out of axis energy emission in the splitting process of focused pulses in normally dispersive materials. A new class of spatio-temporal localized wave patterns is identified. X-waves instability, and nonlinear X-waves, are also expected in periodical Bose condensed gases.
physics.optics:The Dicke superradiance on vibronic transitions of impurity crystals is considered. It is shown that parameters of the superradiance (duration and intensity of the superradiance pulse and delay times) on each vibronic transition depend on the strength of coupling of electronic states with the intramolecular impurity vibration (responsible for the vibronic structure of the optical spectrum in the form of vibrational replicas of the pure electronic line) and on the crystal temperature through the Debye-Waller factor of the lattice vibrations. Theoretical estimates of the ratios of the time delays, as well as of the superradiance pulse intensities for different vibronic transitions well agree with the results of experimental observations of two-color superradiance in the polar dielectric KCl:O2-. In addition, the theory describes qualitatively correctly the critical temperature dependence of the superradiance effect.
physics.optics:This work is concerned with the propagation of electromagnetic waves in isotropic chiral media and with the effects produced by a plane boundary between two such media. In analogy with the phenomena of reflection and refraction of plane electromagnetic waves in ordinary dielectrics, the kinematical and dynamical aspects of these phenomena are studied, such as the intensity of the various wave components and the change in the polarization of the wave as it crosses the boundary. As a prerequisite of this, we show that the plane wave solution must be written as a suitable superposition of the circularly amplitudes on both sides of the interface, we elucidate which is the appropriate set of conditions that the solution must satisfy at the boundary, and we set down the minimal, and complete, set of equations that must be solved for the coefficient amplitudes in order to satisfy the boundary conditions. The equations are solved explicitly for some particular cases and configurations (e.g., normal incidence), the salient features of those solutions are analyzed in some detail, and the general solution to the equations is given as well.
physics.optics:We study the class of endlessly single-mode all-silica photonic crystal fibers with a triangular air-hole cladding. We consider the sensibility to longitudinal nonuniformities and the consequences and limitations for realizing low-loss large-mode area photonic crystal fibers. We also discuss the dominating scattering mechanism and experimentally we confirm that both macro and micro-bending can be the limiting factor.
physics.optics:Some aspects of lasing at vibronic transitions in impurity crystals are theoretically studied. The threshold conditions for a vibronic laser are shown to be dependent on the strength of interaction of optical centers with a local vibration, which forms the vibronic spectrum, and the crystal lattice temperature. The theory can be easily generalized to the spectrum containing a structureless phonon sideband and well agrees with the experimental temperature dependence of the output power of a Mg2SiO4:Cr4+ forsterite laser.
physics.optics:We investigate the characteristics of guided wave modes in planar coupled waveguides. In particular, we calculate the dispersion relations for TM modes in which one or both of the guiding layers consists of negative index media (NIM)-where the permittivity and permeability are both negative. We find that the Poynting vector within the NIM waveguide axis can change sign and magnitude, a feature that is reflected in the dispersion curves.
physics.optics:It has recently been shown that periodic layered media can reflect strongly for all incident angles and polarizations in a given frequency range. The standard treatment gets these band gaps from an eigenvalue equation for the Bloch factor in an infinite periodic structure. We argue that such a procedure may become meaningless when dealing with structures with not very many periods. We propose an alternative approach based on a factorization of the multilayer transfer matrix in terms of three fundamental matrices of simple interpretation. We show that the trace of the transfer matrix sorts the periodic structures into three types with properties closely related to one (and only one) of the three fundamental matrices. We present the reflectance associated to each one of these types, which can be considered as universal features of the reflection in these media.
physics.optics:We study effects of finite height and surrounding material on photonic crystal slabs of one- and two-dimensional photonic crystals with a pseudo-spectral method and finite difference time domain simulation methods. The band gap is shown to be strongly modified by the boundary material. As an application we suggest reflection and guiding of light by patterning the material on top/below the slab.
physics.optics:The characteristics of an imaging system formed by a slab of a lossy left-handed material (LHM) are studied. The transfer function of the LHM imaging system is written in an appropriate product form with each term having a clear physical interpretation. A tiny loss of the LHM may suppress the transmission of evanescent waves through the LHM slab and this is explained physically. An analytical expression for the resolution of the imaging system is derived. It is shown that it is impossible to make a subwavelength imaging by using a realistic LHM imaging system unless the LHM slab is much thinner than the wavelength.
physics.optics:We observe the formation of an intense optical wavepacket fully localized in all dimensions, i.e. both longitudinally (in time) and in the transverse plane, with an extension of a few tens of fsec and microns, respectively. Our measurements show that the self-trapped wave is a X-shaped light bullet spontaneously generated from a standard laser wavepacket via the nonlinear material response (i.e., second-harmonic generation), which extend the soliton concept to a new realm, where the main hump coexists with conical tails which reflect the symmetry of linear dispersion relationship.
physics.optics:The statistical properties of nonlinear phase noise, often called the Gordon-Mollenauer effect, is studied analytically when the number of fiber spans is very large. The joint characteristic functions of the nonlinear phase noise with electric field, received intensity, and the phase of amplifier noise are all derived analytically. Based on the joint characteristic function of nonlinear phase noise with the phase of amplifier noise, the error probability of signal having nonlinear phase noise is calculated using the Fourier series expansion of the probability density function. The error probability is increased due to the dependence between nonlinear phase noise and the phase of amplifier noise. When the received intensity is used to compensate the nonlinear phase noise, the optimal linear and nonlinear minimum mean-square error compensators are derived analytically using the joint characteristic function of nonlinear phase noise and received intensity. Using the joint probability density of received amplitude and phase, the optimal maximum a posteriori probability detector is derived analytically. The nonlinear compensator always performs better than linear compensator.
physics.optics:The exact Green function for the scalar wave equation in a plane with any set of perfectly reflecting straight mirrors, which may be joined to form corners, is given as a diffraction scattering series. Instances would be slit diffraction in optics, or the Schrodinger equation inside (or outside) a general polygonal enclosure ('quantum polygon billiards'). The method is based on the seminal 1896 Riemann helicoid surface solution by Sommerfeld for optical diffraction by a single corner. It is generalised to account for multiple scatter by adapting the analysis of Stovicek for a closely related problem: a collection of magnetic flux lines (points) in a plane, the multi-flux Aharonov-Bohm effect. The short wavelength limit is shown to yield the 'geometrical theory of diffraction'. For slit diffraction the exact series is shown to coincide with that of Schwarzschild in 1902.
physics.optics:We experimentally demonstrate for the first time that a linearly polarized beam is focussed to an asymmetric spot when using a high-numerical aperture focussing system. This asymmetry was predicted by Richards and Wolf [Proc.R.Soc.London A, 253, 358 (1959)] and can only be measured when a polarization insensitive sensor is placed in the focal region. We used a specially modified photodiode in a knife edge type set up to obtain highly resolved images of the total electric energy density distribution at the focus. The results are in good agreement with the predictions of a vectorial focussing theory.
physics.optics:A simple model is used to estimate the Q factor in numerical simulations of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with optical delay demodulation and balanced detection. It is found that an alternative definition of Q is needed for DPSK in order to have a more accurate prediction of the bit error ratio (BER).
physics.optics:With using of point-dipole model the theoretical calculations of main refractive indices and orientation of indicatrix of 18 minerals are performed. The feature of studied minerals is the statistically disordered arrangement of CO3, SO4, SO2, PO4 groups and also separate ions. The optical characters of uniaxial minerals and orientation of indicatrix of orthorhombic and monoclinic minerals, obtained by results of calculations, agree with experimental definitions.
physics.optics:The features of a compact, single pass, multi-pixel optical parametric generator are discussed. Several hundreds of independent high spatial-quality tunable ultrashort pulses were produced by pumping a bulk lithium triborate crystal with an array of tightly focussed intense beams. The array of beams was produced by shining a microlenses array with a large pump beam. Overall conversion efficiency to signal and idler up to 30% of the pump beam has been reported. Shot-to-shot energy fluctuation down to 3% was achieved for the generated radiation.
physics.optics:We use a spatially resolved cavity ring-down technique to show that the 2D eigenmode of an unstable optical cavity has a fractal pattern, i.e. it looks the same at different length scales. In agreement with theory, we find that this pattern has the maximum conceivable roughness, i.e., its fractal dimension is 3.01 plus\minus 0.04. This insight in the nature of unstable cavity eigenmodes may lead to better understanding of wave dynamics in open systems, for both light and matter waves.
physics.optics:Numerical Calculations are employed to study the modulation of light by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in photonic band gap (PBG) structures. The on/off contrast ratio in PBG switch based on optical cavity is determined as a function of the SAW induced dielectric modulation. We show that these structures exhibit high contrast ratios even for moderate acousto-optic coupling
physics.optics:By combining the definition of the Wigner distribution function (WDF) and the matrix method of optical system modeling, we can evaluate the transformation of the former in centered systems with great complexity. The effect of stops and lens diameter are also considered and are shown to be responsible for non-linear clipping of the resulting WDF in the case of coherent illumination and non-linear modulation of the WDF when the illumination is incoherent. As an example, the study of a single lens imaging systems illustrates the applicability of the method.
physics.optics:Free-space propagation can be described as a shearing of the Wigner distribution function in the spatial coordinate; this shearing is linear in paraxial approximation but assumes a more complex shape for wide-angle propagation. Integration in the frequency domain allows the determination of near-field diffraction, leading to the well known Fresnel diffraction when small angles are considered and allowing exact prediction of wide-angle diffraction. The authors use this technique to demonstrate evanescent wave formation and diffraction elimination for very small apertures.
physics.optics:We reelaborate on the basic properties of lossless multilayers by using bilinear transformations. We study some interesting properties of the multilayer transfer function in the unit disk, showing that hyperbolic geometry turns out to be an essential tool for understanding multilayer action. We use a simple trace criterion to classify multilayers into three classes that represent rotations, translations, or parallel displacements. Moreover, we show that these three actions can be decomposed as a product of two reflections in hyperbolic lines. Therefore, we conclude that hyperbolic reflections can be considered as the basic pieces for a deeper understanding of multilayer optics.
physics.optics:In a coherent monoenergetic beam of non-interacting particles, the phase velocity and the particle transport velocity are functions of position, with the strongest variation being in the focal region. These velocities are everywhere parallel to each other, and their product is constant in space. For a coherent monochromatic electromagnetic beam, the energy transport velocity is never greater than the speed of light, and can even be zero. The phase velocities (one each for the non-zero components of the electric and magnetic fields, in general) can be different from each other and from the energy transport velocity, both in direction and in magnitude. The phase velocities at a given point are independent of time, for both particle and electromagnetic beams. The energy velocity is independent of time for the particle beam, but in general oscillates (with angular frequency 2w) in magnitude and direction about its mean value at a given point in the electromagnetic beam. However, there exist electromagnetic steady beams, within which the energy flux, energy density and energy velocity are all independent of time.
physics.optics:The polarization properties of monochromatic light beams are studied. In contrast to the idealization of an electromagnetic plane wave, finite beams which are everywhere linearly polarized in the same direction do not exist. Neither do beams which are everywhere circularly polarized in a fixed plane. It is also shown that transversely finite beams cannot be purely transverse in both their electric and magnetic vectors, and that their electromagnetic energy travels at less than c. The electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic beam have different polarization properties in general, but there exists a class of steady beams in which the electric and magnetic polarizations are the same (and in which energy density and energy flux are independent of time). Examples are given of exactly and approximately linearly polarized beams, and of approximately circularly polarized beams.
physics.optics:We suggest a geometrical framework to discuss periodic layered structures in the unit disk. The band gaps appear when the point representing the system approaches the unit circle. We show that the trace of the matrix describing the basic period allows for a classification in three families of orbits with quite different properties. The laws of convergence of the iterates to the unit circle can be then considered as universal features of the reflection.
physics.optics:The effect of the Kerr nonlinearity on linear non-diffractive Bessel beams is investigated analytically and numerically using the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The nonlinearity is shown to primarily affect the central parts of the Bessel beam, giving rise to radial compression or decompression depending on whether the nonlinearity is focusing or defocusing, respectively. The dynamical properties of Gaussian-truncated Bessel beams are also analysed in the presence of a Kerr nonlinearity. It is found that although a condition for width balance in the root-mean-square sense exists, the beam profile becomes strongly deformed during propagation and may exhibit the phenomena of global and partial collapse.
physics.optics:We describe an optical technique based on the statistical analysis of the random intensity distribution due to the interference of the near-field scattered light with the strong transmitted beam. It is shown that, from the study of the two-dimensional power spectrum of the intensity, one derives the scattered intensity as a function of the scattering wave vector. Near-field conditions are specified and discussed. The substantial advantages over traditional scattering technique are pointed out, and is indicated that the technique could be of interest for wave lengths other than visible light.
physics.optics:The usual computation of the spontaneous emission uses a mixture of classical and quantum postulates. A purely classical computation shows that a source of electromagnetic field absorbs light in the eigenmode it is able to emit. Thus in an excitation by an other mode, the component of this mode on the eigenmode is absorbed, while the remainder is scattered. This loss of energy does not apply to the zero point field which has its regular energy in the eigenmode, so that the zero point field seems more effective than the other fields for the stimulation of light emission.
physics.optics:We perform numerical studies of the effect of sidewall imperfections on the resonant state broadening of the optical microdisk cavities for lasing applications. We demonstrate that even small edge roughness causes a drastic degradation of high-Q whispering gallery (WG) mode resonances reducing their Q-values by many orders of magnitude. At the same time, low-Q WG resonances are rather insensitive to the surface roughness. The results of numerical simulation obtained using the scattering matrix technique, are analyzed and explained in terms of wave reflection at a curved dielectric interface combined with the examination of Poincare surface of sections in the classical ray picture.
physics.optics:We consider plane waves propagating in quadratic nonlinear slab waveguides with nonlinear quasi-phase-matching gratings. We predict analytically and verify numerically the complete gain spectrum for transverse modulational instability, including hitherto undescribed higher order gain bands.
physics.optics:Optical near field has been generated by Laguarre-Gaussian doughnut beam on inner surface of "atom funnel". The resulting optical near field has been measured with the help of fiber probe and a consequent effect on cold atoms- released from MOT, has been estimated. Atoms with temperature less than 10 micro_kelvin can be reflected by the optical near field.
physics.optics:We report on an attempt to generate highly stable continuous terahertz (THz) wave by using optical frequency comb (OFC). About 10-nm wide OFC has been generated through a deep phase modulation of a 852 nm laser line in lithium niobate crystal cavity. The multiple optical modes (side bands) of the OFC, which are equally separated from each other by the modulation frequency (=6 GHz) are taken as the frequency reference. When another semiconductor laser is frequency locked, the stability of the difference frequency between the master laser and the second laser is improved on the same order of the RF modulator. An ultra-narrow line and tunable THz radiation source can be achieved by photomixing of this stable difference-frequency optical beat in a photoconductive antenna.
physics.optics:Doughnut shaped light beam has been generated from Gaussian mode ($TEM_{00}$) cw-Ti sapphire laser. After splitting the pump beam into two equal intensity components and introducing unequal convergence and phase delay while they are recombined it results in doughnut mode. Such a beam is tunable and have long propagation length. The evanescent field generated by 360 mW (at 780 nm wavelength) of such a beam creates optical field of 600 nm decay length with a 5.75 neV repulsive dipole potential. Thus cold Rb atoms (at 10{$\mu$}K or less temperature) released from MOT can be reflected by the surface so that the atoms are collected ultimately at the bottom of the prism. By focussing such doughnut beam with 8 cm focal length converging lens, the dark radius reduces to 22{$\mu$}. We also observe such beam to contain azimuthal phase as well as radial phase distribution.
physics.optics:Ferroelectric ordering, the electroclinic effect and chiral smectic C (SmC*) - smectic A (SmA*) phase transitions in thin planar ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) cells are studied by means of linear electrooptic and second harmonic generation techniques. The ferroelectric switching is detected in biased FLC cells by measuring azimuthal dependences of linear and nonlinear responses. The applied DC-electric field rotates the FLC symmetry axis with initial and final orientations in the cell plane. Comparative studies of the switching behavior in reflection and transmission allows to distinguish the contributions from the bulk and the sub-surface layers of the cell. The analysis of temperature dependence shows the existence of a strong surface coupling. The temperature dependent nonlinear polarization shows a critical behavior corresponding to the superfluid model.
physics.optics:We have generated high power doughnut beam suitable for atom funnel experiment with the conversion efficiency of about 50 %.
physics.optics:We consider large-mode area photonic crystal fibers for visible applications where micro-deformation induced attenuation becomes a potential problem when the effective area A_eff is sufficiently large compared to lambda^2. We argue how a slight increase in fiber diameter D can be used in screening the high-frequency components of the micro-deformation spectrum mechanically and we confirm this experimentally for both 15 and 20 micron core fibers. For typical bending-radii (R~16 cm) the operating band-width increases by ~3-400 nm to the low-wavelength side.
physics.optics:We investigate general properties of spatial 1-dimensional bright photorefractive solitons and suggest various analytical approximations for the soliton profile and the half width, both depending on an intensity parameter r.
physics.optics:A model for a non-Kerr cylindrical nematic fiber is presented. We use the multiple scales method to show the possibility of constructing different kinds of wavepackets of transverse magnetic (TM) modes propagating through the fiber. This procedure allows us to generate different hierarchies of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) which describe the propagation of optical pulses along the fiber. We go beyond the usual weakly nonlinear limit of a Kerr medium and derive an extended Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (eNLS) with a third order derivative nonlinearity, governing the dynamics for the amplitude of the wavepacket. In this derivation the dispersion, self-focussing and diffraction in the nematic are taken into account. Although the resulting nonlinear $PDE$ may be reduced to the modified Korteweg de Vries equation (mKdV), it also has additional complex solutions which include two-parameter families of bright and dark complex solitons. We show analytically that under certain conditions, the bright solitons are actually double embedded solitons. We explain why these solitons do not radiate at all, even though their wavenumbers are contained in the linear spectrum of the system. Finally, we close the paper by making comments on the advantages as well as the limitations of our approach, and on further generalizations of the model and method presented.
physics.optics:The modal cut-off is investigated experimentally in a series of high quality non-linear photonic crystal fibers. We demonstrate a suitable measurement technique to determine the cut-off wavelength and verify it by inspecting the near field of the modes that may be excited below and above the cut-off. We observe a double peak structure in the cut-off spectra, which is attributed to a splitting of the higher order modes. The cut-off is measured for seven different fiber geometries with different pitches and relative hole size, and a very good agreement with recent theoretical work is found.
physics.optics:We address the long-standing unresolved problem concerning the V-parameter in a photonic crystal fiber (PCF). Formulate the parameter appropriate for a core-defect in a periodic structure we argue that the multi-mode cut-off occurs at a wavelength lambda* which satisfies V_PCF(lambda*)=pi. Comparing to numerics and recent cut-off calculations we confirm this result.
physics.optics:We propose in this article an unambiguous definition of the local density of electromagnetic states (LDOS) in a vacuum near an interface in an equilibrium situation at temperature $T$. We show that the LDOS depends only on the electric field Green function of the system but does not reduce in general to the trace of its imaginary part as often used in the literature. We illustrate this result by a study of the LDOS variations with the distance to an interface and point out deviations from the standard definition. We show nevertheless that this definition remains correct at frequencies close to the material resonances such as surface polaritons. We also study the feasability of detecting such a LDOS with apetureless SNOM techniques. We first show that a thermal near-field emission spectrum above a sample should be detectable and that this measurement could give access to the electromagnetic LDOS. It is further shown that the apertureless SNOM is the optical analog of the scanning tunneling microscope which is known to detect the electronic LDOS. We also discuss some recent SNOM experiments aimed at detecting the electromagnetic LDOS.
physics.optics:The nonlinearity of a transmission fiber may be compensated by a specialty fiber and an optical phase conjugator. Such combination may be used to pre-distort signals before each fiber span so to linearize an entire transmission line.
physics.optics:Two fiber lines may compensate each other for nonlinearity with the help of optical phase conjugation. The pair of fiber lines and the optical signals in them may be either mirror-symmetric or translationally symmetric about the conjugator.
physics.optics:We have developed a scattering-matrix approach for numerical calculation of resonant states and Q-values of a nonideal optical disk cavity of an arbitrary shape and of an arbitrary varying refraction index. The developed method has been applied to study the effect of surface roughness and inhomogeneity of the refraction index on Q-values of microdisk cavities for lasing applications. We demonstrate that even small surface roughness can lead to a drastic degradation of high-Q cavity modes by many orders of magnitude. The results of numerical simulation are analyzed and explained in terms of wave reflection at a curved dielectric interface combined with the examination of Poincare surfaces of section and Husimi distributions.
physics.optics:We analyse theoretically for the first time to our knowledge the perfect phase matching of guided TE and TM modes with a multilayer waveguide composed of linear isotropic dielectric materials. Alongside strict investigation into dispersion relations for multilayer systems, we give an explicit qualitative explanation for the phenomenon of mode matching on the basis of the standard one-dimensional homogenization technique, and discuss the minimum number of layers and the refractive index profile for the proposed device scheme. Direct applications of the scheme include polarization-insensitive, intermodal dispersion-free planar propagation, efficient fibre-to-planar waveguide coupling and, potentially, mode filtering. As a self-sufficient result, we present compact analytical expressions for the mode dispersion in a finite, N-period, three-layer dielectric superlattice.
physics.optics:The characteristic function of soliton phase jitter is found analytically when the soliton is perturbed by amplifier noise. In additional to that from amplitude jitter, the nonlinear phase noise due to frequency and timing jitter is also analyzed. Because the nonlinear phase noise is not Gaussian distributed, the overall phase jitter is also non-Gaussian. For a fixed mean nonlinear phase shift, the contribution of nonlinear phase noise from frequency and timing jitter decreases with distance and signal-to-noise ratio.
physics.optics:The field energy distributions and effective mode areas of silica-based photonic bandgap fibers with a honeycomb airhole structure in the cladding and an extra airhole defining the core are investigated. We present a generalization of the common effective area definition, suitable for the problem at hand, and compare the results for the photonic bandgap fibers with those of index-guiding microstructured fibers. While the majority of the field energy in the honeycomb photonic bandgap fibers is found to reside in the silica, a substantial fraction (up to ~30%) can be located in the airholes. This property may show such fibers particularly interesting for sensor applications, especially those based on nonlinear effects or interaction with other structures (e.g. Bragg gratings) in the glass.
physics.optics:The waveguiding properties of two silica-based airguiding photonic bandgap fiber designs are investigated with special emphasis on material effects. The nonlinear coefficients are found to be 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained in index-guiding microstructured fibers with large mode areas. The material dispersion of silica makes a significant contribution to the total chromatic dispersion although less than 10% of the field energy is located in the silica regions of the fibers. These findings suggest that dispersion engineering through the choice of base material may be a possibility in this type of fibers.
physics.optics:Lithium thioindate (LiInS$_{2}$) is a new nonlinear chalcogenide biaxial material transparent from 0.4 to 12 $\mu$m, that has been successfully grown in large sizes and good optical quality. We report on new physical properties that are relevant for laser and nonlinear optics applications. With respect to AgGaS(e)$_2$ ternary chalcopyrite materials, LiInS$_{2}$ displays a nearly-isotropic thermal expansion behavior, a 5-times larger thermal conductivity associated with high optical damage thresholds, and an extremely low intensity-dependent absorption allowing direct high-power downconversion from the near-IR to the deep mid-IR. Continuous-wave difference-frequency generation (5-11$ \mu$m) of Ti:sapphire laser sources is reported for the first time.
physics.optics:We find that the function that describes the surface of spherical aberration free lenses can be used for both positive and negative refractive index media. With the inclusion of negative index, this function assumes the form of all the conic sections and expands the theory of aplanatic optical surfaces. There are two different symmetry centers with respect to the index that create an asymmetric relationship between positive and negative index lens profiles. In the thin lens limit the familiar formulas for image position and magnification hold for any index.
physics.optics:We report the surprising observation of directional tunneling escape from nearly spherical fused-silica optical resonators, in which most of the phase space is filled with nonchaotic regular trajectories. Experimental and theoretical studies of the dependence of the far-field emission pattern on both the degree of deformation and the excitation condition show that nonperturbative phase-space structures in the internal ray dynamics profoundly affect tunneling leakage of the whispering-gallery modes.
physics.optics:Intermodal interactions displayed through the phenomena of mode coupling and conversion in optical systems are treated by means of the Lindstedt-Poincare perturbation method of strained parameters more widely known in classical quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry as the stationary perturbation technique. The focus here is on the mode conversion at the points of virtual phase matching (otherwise called anticrossings or avoided crossings) associated with the maximum conversion efficiency. The method is shown to provide a convenient tool to deal with intermodal interactions at anticrossings -- interactions induced by any kind of perturbation in dielectric index profile of the waveguide, embracing optical inhomogeneity, magnetization of arbitrary orientation, and nonlinearity. Closed-form analytic expressions are derived for the minimum value of mode mismatch and for the length of complete mode conversion (the coupling length, or the beat length) in generic waveguiding systems exhibiting anticrossings. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the method, these general expressions are further applied to the case of TE -- TM mode conversion in (i) a multilayer gyrotropic waveguide under piecewise-constant, arbitrarily oriented magnetization, and (ii) an optically-inhomogeneous planar dielectric waveguide -- an example which the standard coupled-mode theory fails to describe.
physics.optics:We exploit a slightly noncollinear second-harmonic cross-correlation scheme to map the 3D space-time intensity distribution of an unknown complex-shaped ultrashort optical pulse. We show the capability of the technique to reconstruct both the amplitude and the phase of the field through the coherence of the nonlinear interaction down to a resolution of 10 $\mu$m in space and 200 fs in time. This implies that the concept of second-harmonic holography can be employed down to the sub-ps time scale, and used to discuss the features of the technique in terms of the reconstructed fields.
physics.optics:Nonlinear mode coupling in a coaxial waveguide filled with Faraday material has been considered. The picture of mode interaction is shown to resemble Coulomb interaction of charges: higher modes with nonzero angular momentum interact like effective charges via exchange of zero angular momentum quanta of the fundamental mode. Thus, at large distances this interaction becomes the dominant mechanism of mode coupling. The developed model may be used in designing coaxial photonic crystal fibers with strong tailored mode interaction.
physics.optics:We develop a general theory of spatial solitons in a liquid crystalline medium exhibiting a nonlinearity with an arbitrary degree of effective nonlocality. The model accounts the observability of "accessible solitons" and establishes an important link with parametric solitons.
physics.optics:Theoretical analysis is presented on quantum state evolution of polarization light waves at frequencies $\omega_{o}$ and $\omega_{e}$ in a periodically poled nonlinear crystal (PPNC). It is shown that the variances of all the four Stokes parameters can be squeezed.
physics.optics:Counter-propagating light fields have the ability to create self-organized one-dimensional optically bound arrays of microscopic particles, where the light fields adapt to the particle locations and vice versa. We develop a theoretical model to describe this situation and show good agreement with recent experimental data (Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 128301 (2002)) for two and three particles, if the scattering force is assumed to dominate the axial trapping of the particles. The extension of these ideas to two and three dimensional optically bound states is also discussed.
physics.optics:The inversion of a diffraction pattern offers aberration-free diffraction-limited 3D images without the resolution and depth-of-field limitations of lens-based tomographic systems, the only limitation being radiation damage. We review our experimental results, discuss the fundamental limits of this technique and future plans.
physics.optics:The stability of two-dimensional bright vortex solitons in a media with focusing cubic and defocusing quintic nonlinearities is investigated analytically and numerically. It is proved that above some critical beam powers not only one- and two-charged but also multiple-charged stable vortex solitons do exist. A vortex soliton occurs robust with respect to symmetry-breaking modulational instability in the self-defocusing regime provided that its radial profile becomes flattened, so that a self-trapped wave beam gets a pronounced surface. It is demonstrated that the dynamics of a slightly perturbed stable vortex soliton resembles an oscillation of a liquid stream having a surface tension. Using the idea of sustaining effective surface tension for spatial vortex soliton in a media with competing nonlinearities the explanation of a suppression of the modulational instability is proposed.
physics.optics:Quasi error-free 10 Gbit/s data transmission is demonstrated over a novel type of 50 micron core diameter photonic crystal fiber with as much as 100 m length. Combined with 850$ nm VCSEL sources, this fiber is an attractive alternative to graded-index multi-mode fibers for datacom applications. A comparison to numerical simulations suggests that the high bit-rate may be partly explained by inter-modal diffusion.
physics.optics:The Casimir force between metallic plates made of realistic materials is evaluated for distances in the nanometer range. A spectrum over real frequencies is introduced and shows narrow peaks due to surface resonances (plasmon polaritons or phonon polaritons) that are coupled across the vacuum gap. We demonstrate that the Casimir force originates from the attraction (repulsion) due to the corresponding symmetric (antisymmetric) eigenmodes, respectively. This picture is used to derive a simple analytical estimate of the Casimir force at short distances. We recover the result known for Drude metals without absorption and compute the correction for weakly absorbing materials.
physics.optics:In recent years there has been an explosive development of interest in the measurement of forces at the microscopic level, such as within living cells, as well as the properties of fluids and suspensions on this scale, using optically trapped particles as probes. The next step would be to measure torques and associated rotational motion. This would allow measurement on very small scales since no translational motion is needed. It could also provide an absolute measurement of the forces holding a stationary non-rotating particle in place. The laser-induced torque acting on an optically trapped microscopic birefringent particle can be used for these measurements. Here we present a new method for simple, robust, accurate, simultaneous measurement of the rotation speed of a laser trapped birefringent particle, and the optical torque acting on it, by measuring the change in angular momentum of the light from passing through the particle. This method does not depend on the size or shape of the particle or the laser beam geometry, nor does it depend on the properties of the surrounding medium. This could allow accurate measurement of viscosity on a microscopic scale.
physics.optics:Optical tweezers are widely used for the manipulation of cells and their internal structures. However, the degree of manipulation possible is limited by poor control over the orientation of trapped cells. We show that it is possible to controllably align or rotate disc shaped cells - chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea - in a plane polarised Gaussian beam trap, using optical torques resulting predominantly from circular polarisation induced in the transmitted beam by the non-spherical shape of the cells.
physics.optics:Optical trapping is a widely used technique, with many important applications in biology and metrology. Complete modelling of trapping requires calculation of optical forces, primarily a scattering problem, and non-optical forces. The T-matrix method is used to calculate forces acting on spheroidal and cylindrical particles.
physics.optics:Optical trapping, where microscopic particles are trapped and manipulated by light is a powerful and widespread technique, with the single-beam gradient trap (also known as optical tweezers) in use for a large number of biological and other applications.   The forces and torques acting on a trapped particle result from the transfer of momentum and angular momentum from the trapping beam to the particle.   Despite the apparent simplicity of a laser trap, with a single particle in a single beam, exact calculation of the optical forces and torques acting on particles is difficult. Calculations can be performed using approximate methods, but are only applicable within their ranges of validity, such as for particles much larger than, or much smaller than, the trapping wavelength, and for spherical isotropic particles.   This leaves unfortunate gaps, since wavelength-scale particles are of great practical interest because they are readily and strongly trapped and are used to probe interesting microscopic and macroscopic phenomena, and non-spherical or anisotropic particles, biological, crystalline, or other, due to their frequent occurance in nature, and the possibility of rotating such objects or controlling or sensing their orientation.   The systematic application of electromagnetic scattering theory can provide a general theory of laser trapping, and render results missing from existing theory. We present here calculations of force and torque on a trapped particle obtained from this theory and discuss the possible applications, including the optical measurement of the force and torque.
physics.optics:Multipole expansion of an incident radiation field - that is, representation of the fields as sums of vector spherical wavefunctions - is essential for theoretical light scattering methods such as the T-matrix method and generalised Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT). In general, it is theoretically straightforward to find a vector spherical wavefunction representation of an arbitrary radiation field. For example, a simple formula results in the useful case of an incident plane wave. Laser beams present some difficulties. These problems are not a result of any deficiency in the basic process of spherical wavefunction expansion, but are due to the fact that laser beams, in their standard representations, are not radiation fields, but only approximations of radiation fields. This results from the standard laser beam representations being solutions to the paraxial scalar wave equation. We present an efficient method for determining the multipole representation of an arbitrary focussed beam.
physics.optics:The T-matrix method is widely used for the calculation of scattering by particles of sizes on the order of the illuminating wavelength. Although the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) is the most commonly used technique for calculating the T-matrix, a variety of methods can be used.   We consider some general principles of calculating T-matrices, and apply the point-matching method to calculate the T-matrix for particles devoid of symmetry. This method avoids the time-consuming surface integrals required by the EBCM.
physics.optics:Light-induced rotation of absorbing microscopic particles by transfer of angular momentum from light to the material raises the possibility of optically driven micromachines. The phenomenon has been observed using elliptically polarized laser beams or beams with helical phase structure. But it is difficult to develop high power in such experiments because of overheating and unwanted axial forces, limiting the achievable rotation rates to a few hertz. This problem can in principle be overcome by using transparent particles, transferring angular momentum by a mechanism first observed by Beth in 1936, when he reported a tiny torque developed in a quartz waveplate due to the change in polarization of transmitted light. Here we show that an optical torque can be induced on microscopic birefringent particles of calcite held by optical tweezers. Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, the particles either become aligned with the plane of polarization (and thus can be rotated through specified angles) or spin with constant rotation frequency. Because these microscopic particles are transparent, they can be held in three-dimensional optical traps at very high power without heating. We have observed rotation rates in excess of 350 Hz.
physics.optics:This report contains a tutorial introduction to the method of importance sampling. The use of this method is illustrated for simulations of the noise-induced energy jitter of return-to-zero pulses in optical communication systems.
physics.optics:The 3-dimensional coherence matrix is interpreted by emphasising its invariance with respect to spatial rotations. Under these transformations, it naturally decomposes into a real symmetric positive definite matrix, interpreted as the moment of inertia of the ensemble (and the corresponding ellipsoid), and a real axial vector, corresponding to the mean angular momentum of the ensemble. This vector and tensor are related by several inequalities, and the interpretation is compared to those in which unitary invariants of the coherence matrix are studied.
physics.optics:We propose novel multi-phase-matched process that starts with generation of a pair of symmetric second-harmonic waves. Each of them interacts again with the fundamental wave to produce two constructively interfering third harmonic waves collinear to the fundamental input wave.
physics.optics:We numerically calculate the equivalent mode-field radius of the fundamental mode in a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) and show that this is a function of the V-parameter only and not the relative hole size. This dependency is similar to what is found for graded-index standard fibers and we furthermore show that the relation for the PCF can be excellently approximated with the same general mathematical expression. This is to our knowledge the first semi-analytical description of the mode-field radius of a PCF.
physics.optics:The output spectrum of both gas and semiconductor lasers usually contains more than one frequency. Multimode operation in gas versus semiconductor lasers arises from different physics. In gas lasers, slow equilibration of the electron populations at different energies makes each frequency an independent single-mode laser. The slow electron diffusion in semiconductor lasers, combined with the spatially varying optical intensity patterns of the modes, makes each region of space an independent single-mode laser. We develop a rate equation model for the photon number in each mode which captures all these effects. Plotting the photon number versus pumping rate for the competing modes, in both subthreshold and above threshold operation, illustrates the changes in the laser output spectrum due to either slow equilibration or slow diffusion of electrons.
physics.optics:A cascaded iterative Fourier transform (CIFT) algorithm is presented for optical security applications. Two phase-masks are designed and located in the input and the Fourier domains of a 4-f correlator respectively, in order to implement the optical encryption or authenticity verification. Compared with previous methods, the proposed algorithm employs an improved searching strategy: modifying the phase-distributions of both masks synchronously as well as enlarging the searching space. Computer simulations show that the algorithm results in much faster convergence and better image quality for the recovered image. Each of these masks is assigned to different person. Therefore, the decrypted image can be obtained only when all these masks are under authorization. This key-assignment strategy may reduce the risk of being intruded.
physics.optics:Generic wave dislocations (phase singularities, optical vortices) in three dimensions have anisotropic local structure, which is analysed, with emphasis on the twist of surfaces of equal phase along the singular line, and the rotation of the local anisotropy ellipse (twirl). Various measures of twist and twirl are compared in specific examples, and a theorem is found relating the (quantised) topological twist and twirl for a closed dislocation loop with the anisotropy C line index threading the loop.
physics.optics:Diffraction is a fundamental property of light propagation. Owing to this phenomenon,light diffracts out in all directions when it passes through a subwavelength slit.This imposes a fundamental limit on the transverse size of a light beam at a given distance from the aperture. We show that a subwavelength-sized beam propagating without diffractive broadening can be produced in free space by the constructive interference of multiple beams of a Fresnel source of the respective high-refraction-index waveguide. Moreover, it is shown that such a source can be constructed not only for continuous waves, but also for ultra-short (near single-cycle) pulses. The results theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of completely diffraction-free subwavelength-beam optics, for both continuous waves and ultra-short pulses. The approach extends operation of the near-field subwavelength-beam optics, such as near-field scanning optical microscopy and spectroscopy,to the "not-too-distant" field regime (0.5 to about 10 wavelengths).
physics.optics:In recent years the topic of localized wave solutions of the homogeneous scalar wave equation, i.e., the wave fields that propagate without any appreciable spread or drop in intensity, has been discussed in many aspects in numerous publications. In this review the main results of this rather disperse theoretical material are presented in a single mathematical representation - the Fourier decomposition by means of angular spectrum of plane waves. This unified description is shown to lead to a transparent physical understanding of the phenomenon as such and yield the means of optical generation of such wave fields.
physics.optics:In recent experiments, localized and stationary pulses have been generated in second-order nonlinear processes with femtosecond pulses, whose asymptotic features relate with those of nondiffracting and nondispersing polychromatic Bessel beams in linear dispersive media. We investigate on the nature of these linear waves, and show that they can be identified with the X-shaped (O-shaped) modes of the hyperbolic (elliptic) wave equation in media with normal (anomalous) dispersion. Depending on the relative strengths of mode phase mismatch, group velocity mismatch with respect to a plane pulse, and of the defeated group velocity dispersion, these modes can adopt the form of pulsed Bessel beams, focus wave modes, and X-waves (O-waves), respectively.
physics.optics:We explain the main concepts centered around Sharafutdinov's ray transform, its kernel, and the extent to which it can be inverted. It is shown how the ray transform emerges naturally in any attempt to reconstruct optical and stress tensors within a photoelastic medium from measurements on the state of polarization of light beams passing through the strained medium. The problem of reconstruction of stress tensors is crucially related to the fact that the ray transform has a nontrivial kernel; the latter is described by a theorem for which we provide a new proof which is simpler and shorter as in Sharafutdinov's original work, as we limit our scope to tensors which are relevant to Photoelasticity. We explain how the kernel of the ray transform is related to the decomposition of tensor fields into longitudinal and transverse components. The merits of the ray transform as a tool for tensor reconstruction are studied by walking through an explicit example of reconstructing the $\sigma_{33}$-component of the stress tensor in a cylindrical photoelastic specimen. In order to make the paper self-contained we provide a derivation of the basic equations of Integrated Photoelasticity which describe how the presence of stress within a photoelastic medium influences the passage of polarized light through the material.
physics.optics:The controversial term "nondiffracting beam" was introduced into optics by Durnin in 1987. Discussions related to that term revived interest in problems of the light diffraction and resulted in an appearance of the new research direction of the classical optics dealing with the localized transfer of electromagnetic energy. In the paper, the physical concept of the nondiffracting propagation is presented and the basic properties of the nondiffracting beams are reviewed. Attention is also focused to the experimental realization and to applications of the nondiffracting beams.
physics.optics:Theory of the optical parametric amplification at high-frequency pumping in crystals with a regular space modulation of the sign of nonlinear coupling coefficient of interacting waves is developed. By applying the matrix method, the theory is based on a step-by-step approach. It is shown that, in the case where the pumping intensity is less than some critical value, the spatial dynamics of the signal intensity inside a separate layer with the constant nonlinear coefficient has an oscillatory behavior and the change of the signal intensity from layer to layer is defined, in general, by the power function. The same law is valid for the change of variance of signal's quadrature components. At large number of layers, these dependences can be reduced to the well-known ones for homogeneous nonlinear optical crystals.
physics.optics:We show how it is possible to controllably rotate or align microscopic particles of isotropic nonabsorbing material in a TEM00 Gaussian beam trap, with simultaneous measurement of the applied torque using purely optical means. This is a simple and general method of rotation, requiring only that the particle is elongated along one direction. Thus, this method can be used to rotate or align a wide range of naturally occurring particles. The ability to measure the applied torque enables the use of this method as a quantitative tool--the rotational equivalent of optical tweezers based force measurement. As well as being of particular value for the rotation of biological specimens, this method is also suitable for the development of optically-driven micromachines.
physics.optics:The near-field diffraction of fs and sub-fs light pulses by nm-size slit-type apertures and its implication for near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is analyzed. The amplitude distributions of the diffracted wave-packets having the central wavelengths in the visible spectral region are found by using the Neerhoff and Mur coupled integral equations, which are solved numerically for each Fourier's component of the wave-packet. In the case of fs pulses, the duration and transverse dimensions of the diffracted pulse remain practically the same as that of the input pulse. This demonstrates feasibility of the NSOM in which a fs pulse is used to provide the fs temporal resolution together with nm-scale spatial resolution. In the sub-fs domain, the Fourier spectrum of the transmitted pulse experiences a considerable narrowing that leads to the increase of the pulse duration in a few times. This imposes a limit on the simultaneous resolutions in time and space.
physics.optics:We show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that highly absorbing particles can be trapped and manipulated in a single highly focused Gaussian beam. Our studies of the effects of polarized light on such particles show that they can be set into rotation by elliptically polarized light and that both the sense and the speed of their rotation can be smoothly controlled.
physics.optics:Wolf discovered how the spatial coherence characteristics of the source affect the spectrum of the radiation in the far zone. In particular the spatial coherence of the source can result either in red or blue shifts in the measured spectrum.His predictions have been verified in a large number of different classes of systems. Wolf and coworkers usually assume a given form of source correlations and study its consequence. In this paper we consider microscopic origin of spatial coherence and radiation from a system of atoms. We discuss how the radiation is different from that produced from an independent system of atoms. We show that the process of radiation itself is responsible for the creation of spatial correlations within the source. We present different features of the spectrum and other statistical properties of the radiation, which show strong dependence on the spatial correlations. We show the existence of a new type of two-photon resonance that arises as a result of such spatial correlations. We further show how the spatial coherence of the field can be used in the context of radiation generated by nonlinear optical processes. We conclude by demonstrating the universality of Wolf shifts and its application in the context of pulse propagation in a dispersive medium.
physics.optics:We experimentally demonstrate for the first time that a radially polarized field can be focussed to a spot size significantly smaller (0.16(1) lambda^2) than for linear polarization (0.26 lambda^2). The effect of the vector properties of light is shown by a comparison of the focal intensity distribution for radially and azimuthally polarized input fields. For strong focusing a radially polarized field leads to a longitudinal electric field component at the focus which is sharp and centered at the optical axis. The relative contribution of this component is enhanced by using an annular aperture.
physics.optics:Two strong simultaneous resonances of scattering--double-resonant extremely asymmetrical scattering (DEAS)--are predicted in two parallel, oblique, periodic Bragg arrays separated by a gap, when the scattered wave propagates parallel to the arrays. One of these resonances is with respect to frequency (which is common to all types of Bragg scattering), and another is with respect to phase variation between the arrays. The diffractional divergence of the scattered wave is shown to be the main physical reason for DEAS in the considered structure. Although the arrays are separated, they are shown to interact by means of the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave across the gap from one array into the other. It is also shown that increasing separation between the two arrays results in a broader and weaker resonance with respect to phase shift. The analysis is based on a recently developed new approach allowing for the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave inside and outside the arrays. Physical interpretations of the predicted features of DEAS in separated arrays are also presented. Applicability conditions for the developed theory are derived.
physics.optics:Radiation pressure forces in a focussed laser beam can be used to trap microscopic absorbing particles against a substrate. Calculations based on momentum transfer considerations show that stable trapping occurs before the beam waist, and that trapping is more effective with doughnut beams. Such doughnut beams can transfer angular momentum leading to rotation of the trapped particles. Energy is also transferred, which can result in heating of the particles to temperatures above the boiling point of the surrounding medium.
physics.optics:Extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS) is a highly resonant type of Bragg scattering with a strong resonant increase of the scattered wave amplitude inside and outside the grating. EAS is realized when the scattered wave propagates parallel to the grating boundaries. We present a rigorous algorithm for the analysis of non-steady-state EAS, and investigate the relaxation of the incident and scattered wave amplitudes to their steady-state values. Non-steady-state EAS of bulk TE electromagnetic waves is analyzed in narrow and wide, slanted, holographic gratings. Typical relaxation times are determined and compared with previous rough estimations. Physical explanation of the predicted effects is presented.
physics.optics:We demonstrate generation and frequency doubling of unit charge vortices in a linear astigmatic resonator. Topological instability of the double charge harmonic vortices leads to well separated vortex cores that are shown to rotate, and become anisotropic, as the resonator is tuned across resonance.
physics.optics:We have developed a new method based on two cavities containing $\chi^{(2)}$ media to reshape optical pulses by an all-optical technique. The system is entirely passive \emph{i.e.}, all the energy is brought by the incoming pulse and uses two successive optical cavities with independent thresholds. The output pulse is close to a rectangular shape. We show that this technique could be extended to high bit rates and telecommunication wavelength using very small cavities containing current nonlinear materials.
physics.optics:We show that useful non-instantaneous nonlinear phase shifts can be obtained from cascaded quadratic processes in the presence of group velocity mismatch. The two-field nature of the process permits responses that can be effectively advanced or retarded in time with respect to one of the fields. There is an analogy to a generalized Raman-scattering effect, permitting both red and blue shifts of short pulses. We expect this capability to have many applications in short-pulse generation and propagation, such as the compensation of Raman-induced effects and high-quality pulse compression, which we discuss.
physics.optics:A method of formation of the tightly confined distortion-free fs pulses with the step-like decreasing of intensity under the finite-length propagation in free space is described. Such pulses are formed by the Fresnel source of a high refraction-index waveguide. The source reproduces in free space a propagation-invariant (distortion-free) pulse confined by the waveguide. Converse to the case of material waveguides, when the pulse goes out from the Fresnel (virtual) waveguide its shape is not changed, but the intensity immediately drops down to the near-zero level.
physics.optics:Based on a recent formulation of the V-parameter of a photonic crystal fiber we provide numerically based empirical expressions for this quantity only dependent on the two structural parameters - the air hole diameter and the hole-to-hole center spacing. Based on the unique relation between the V-parameter and the equivalent mode field radius we identify how the parameter space for these fibers is restricted in order for the fibers to remain single mode while still having a guided mode confined to the core region.
physics.optics:The alternative to dynamic alignment explanation of experimental results on spatial-asymmetric dissociation of molecules in a laser field is proposed. The concept of geometrical alignment is sufficient for explanation of these results. In this case the spatial anisotropy of interaction of molecules with laser radiation is transferred from one field to another through the ordinary mechanism of nonlinear optical interactions. Thus laser radiation does not create alignment, but only registers it. A physical basis of such nonlinear processes is inequality of forward and reversed optical transitions that corresponds to a concept of time invariance violation in electromagnetic interactions. Directions of the further researches in the field of alignment spectroscopy are discussed.
physics.optics:Periodic layered media can reflect strongly for all incident angles and polarizations in a given frequency range. Quarter-wave stacks at normal incidence are commonplace in the design of such omnidirectional reflectors. We discuss alternative design criteria to optimize these systems.
physics.optics:We study propagation of a pair of oppositely charged and mutually incoherent vortices in anisotropic nonlinear optical media. Mutual interactions retard the delocalization of the vortex core observed for isolated vortices.
physics.optics:The efficiency of evanescent coupling between a silica optical fiber taper and a silicon photonic crystal waveguide is studied. A high reflectivity mirror on the end of the photonic crystal waveguide is used to recollect, in the backwards propagating fiber mode, the optical power that is initially coupled into the photonic crystal waveguide. An outcoupled power in the backward propagating fiber mode of 88% of the input power is measured, corresponding to a lower bound on the coupler efficiency of 94%.
physics.optics:The reversible phase transition induced by femtosecond laser excitation of Gallium has been studied by measuring the dielectric function at 775 nm with ~ 200 fs temporal resolution. The real and imaginary parts of the transient dielectric function were calculated from absolute reflectivity of Gallium layer measured at two different angles of incidence, using Fresnel formulas. The time-dependent electron-phonon effective collision frequency, the heat conduction coefficient and the volume fraction of a new phase were restored directly from the experimental data, and the time and space dependent electron and lattice temperatures in the layer undergoing phase transition were reconstructed without ad hoc assumptions. We converted the temporal dependence of the electron-phonon collision rate into the temperature dependence, and demonstrated, for the first time, that the electron-phonon collision rate has a non-linear character. This temperature dependence converges into the known equilibrium function during the cooling stage. The maximum fraction of a new phase in the laser-excited Gallium layer reached only 60% even when the deposited energy was two times the equilibrium enthalpy of melting. We have also demonstrated that the phase transition pace and a fraction of the transformed material depended strongly on the thickness of the laser-excited Gallium layer, which was of the order of several tens of nanometers for the whole range of the pump laser fluencies up to the damage threshold. The kinetics of the phase transformation after the laser excitation can be understood on the basis of the classical theory of the first-order phase transition while the duration of non-thermal stage appears to be comparable to the sub-picosecond pulse length.
physics.optics:The derivation of a new condition for characterizing isotropic dielectric-magnetic materials exhibiting negative phase velocity, and the equivalence of that condition with previously derived conditions, are presented.
physics.optics:Linear and nonlinear directional couplers are currently used in fiber optics communications. They may also play a role in multiphoton approaches to quantum information processing if accurate control is obtained over the phases and polarizations of the signals at the output of the coupler. With this motivation, the constants of motion of the coupler equation are used to obtain an explicit analytical solution for the nonlinear coupler.
physics.optics:A single-mode all-silica photonic crystal fiber with an effective area of 600 square-micron and low bending loss is demonstrated. The fiber is characterized in terms of attenuation, chromatic dispersion and modal properties.
physics.optics:Based on the Wigner distribution approach, an analysis of the effect of partial incoherence on the transverse instability of soliton structures in nonlinear Kerr media is presented. It is explicitly shown, that for a Lorentzian incoherence spectrum the partial incoherence gives rise to a damping which counteracts, and tends to suppress, the transverse instability growth. However, the general picture is more complicated and it is shown that the effect of the partial incoherence depends crucially on the form of the incoherence spectrum. In fact, for spectra with finite rms-width, the partial incoherence may even increase both the growth rate and the range of unstable, transverse wave numbers.
physics.optics:We study theoretically and experimentally the modulational instability of broad optical beams in photorefractive nonlinear media. We demonstrate the impact of the anisotropy of the nonlinearity on the growth rate of periodic perturbations. Our findings are confirmed by experimental measurements in a strontium barium niobate photorefractive crystal.
physics.optics:Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) processes are ``coherent,'' but the phase of the anti-Stokes radiation is usually lost by most incoherent spectroscopic CARS measurements. We propose a novel Raman microscopy imaging method called Nonlinear Interferometric Vibrational Imaging, which measures Raman spectra by obtaining the temporal anti-Stokes signal through nonlinear interferometry. With a more complete knowledge of the anti-Stokes signal, we show through simulations that a high-resolution Raman spectrum can be obtained of a molecule in a single pulse using broadband radiation. This could be useful for identifying the three-dimensional spatial distribution of molecular species in tissue.
physics.optics:An examination of the propagation of intense 200 fs pulses in water reveals light filaments not sustained by the balance between Kerr-induced self-focusing and plasma-induced defocusing. Their appearance is interpreted as the consequence of a spontaneous reshaping of the wave packet form a gaussian into a conical wave, driven by the requirement of maximum localization, minimum losses and stationarity in the presence of non-linear absorption.
physics.optics:In positive phase-mismatched SHG and normal dispersion, a gaussian spatio-temporal pulse transforms spontaneously into a X-pulse, underlies spatio-temporal compression and eventually leads to stationary 3-D propagation. Experimental and numerical data are provided
physics.optics:It is shown that a system of two coupled planar material sheets possessing surface mode (polariton) resonances can be used for the purpose of evanescent field restoration and, thus, for the sub-wavelength near-field imaging. The sheets are placed in free space so that they are parallel and separated by a certain distance. Due to interaction of the resonating surface modes (polaritons) of the sheets an exponential growth in the amplitude of an evanescent plane wave coming through the system can be achieved. This effect was predicted earlier for backward-wave (double-negative or Veselago) slab lenses. The alternative system considered here is proved to be realizable at microwaves by grids or arrays of resonant particles. The necessary electromagnetic properties of the resonating grids and the particles are investigated and established. Theoretical results are supported by microwave experiments that demonstrate amplification of evanescent modes.
physics.optics:Motivated by recent experimental work by Folkenberg et al. we consider the effect of weak disorder in the air-hole lattice of small-core photonic crystal fibers. We find that the broken symmetry leads to higher-order modes which have generic intensity distributions resembling those found in standard fibers with elliptical cores. This explains why recently reported experimental higher-order mode profiles appear very different from those calculated numerically for ideal photonic crystal fibers with inversion and six-fold rotational symmetry. The splitting of the four higher-order modes into two groups fully correlates with the observation that these modes have different cut-offs.
physics.optics:We present a numerical investigation of the ray dynamics in a paraxial optical cavity when a ray splitting mechanism is present. The cavity is a conventional two-mirror stable resonator and the ray splitting is achieved by inserting an optical beam splitter perpendicular to the cavity axis. We show that depending on the position of the beam splitter the optical resonator can become unstable and the ray dynamics displays a positive Lyapunov exponent.
physics.optics:This paper analyses theoretically and numerically the effect of varying grating amplitude on the extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS) of bulk and guided optical modes in non-uniform strip-like periodic Bragg arrays with stepwise and gradual variations in the grating amplitude across the array. A recently developed new approach based on allowance for the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave is used for this analysis. It is demonstrated that gradual variations in magnitude of the grating amplitude may change the pattern of EAS noticeably but not radically. On the other hand, phase variations in the grating may result in a radically new type of Bragg scattering - double-resonant EAS (DEAS). In this case, a combination of two strong simultaneous resonances (one with respect to frequency, and another with respect to the phase variation) is predicted to take place in non-uniform arrays with a step-like phase and gradual magnitude variations of the grating amplitude. The tolerances of EAS and DEAS to small gradual variations in the grating amplitude are determined. The main features of these types of scattering in non-uniform arrays are explained by the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave inside and outside the array.
physics.optics:We present a symmetry-based theory of the depolarization induced by subwavelength metal hole arrays. We derive the Mueller matrices of hole arrays with various symmetries (in particular square and hexagonal) when illuminated by a finite-diameter (e.g. gaussian) beam. The depolarization is due to a combination of two factors: (i) propagation of surface plasmons along the surface of the array, (ii) a spread of wave vectors in the incident beam.
physics.optics:We investigate the ray dynamics in an optical cavity when a ray splitting mechanism is present. The cavity is a conventional two-mirror stable resonator and the ray splitting is achieved by inserting an optical beam splitter perpendicular to the cavity axis. Using Hamiltonian optics, we show that such a simple device presents a surprisingly rich chaotic ray dynamics.
physics.optics:We concentrate on the forces and torques exerted on transparent and absorbing particles trapped in laser beams containing optical vortices. We review previous theoretical and experimental work and then present new calculations of the effect of vortex beams on absorbing particles.
physics.optics:We have monitored the space-time transformation of 150-fs pulse, undergoing self-focusing and filamentation in water, by means of the nonlinear gating tech- nique. We have observed that pulse splitting and subsequent recombination apply to axial temporal intensity only, whereas space-integrated pulse profile preserves its original shape.
physics.optics:It is shown that three-dimensional nonparaxial beams are described by the oblate spheroidal exact solutions of the Helmholtz equation. For the first time, their beam behaviour is investigated and their corresponding parameters are defined. Using the fact that the beam width of the family of paraxial Gaussian beams is described by an hyperbola, the connection between the physical parameters of nonparaxial spheroidal beam solutions and those of paraxial beams is formally stablished. These results are also helpful to investigate the exact vector nonparaxial beams.
physics.optics:The images of the silicon test object has been carried out. An image for in-line hard X-ray hologram is presented. The transmission of a hologram image for hard X-ray radiation using Fresnel phase zone plate has been investigated.
physics.optics:We develop a theory of light transmission through an aperture-type near-field optical probe with a dissipative matter in its semiconducting core described by a complex frequency-dependent dielectric function. We evaluate the near-field transmission coefficient of a metallized silicon probe with a large taper angle of in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range. It is shown that in this spectral range the use of a short silicon probe instead of a glass one allows to achieve a strong (up to 10$^2-10^{3}$) enhancement in the transmission efficiency.
physics.optics:A metal nanoparticle plasmon waveguide for electromagnetic energy transport utilizing dispersion engineering to dramatically increase lateral energy confinement via a two-dimensional pattern of Au dots on an optically thin Si membrane is described. Using finite-difference time-domain simulations and coupled-mode theory, we show that phase-matched evanescent excitation from conventional fiber tapers is possible with efficiencies > 90 % for realistic geometries. Energy loss in this waveguide is mainly due to material absorption, allowing for 1/e energy decay distances of about 2 mm for excitation at telecommunication frequencies. This concept can be extended to the visible regime and promises applications in optical energy guiding, optical sensing, and switching.
physics.optics:A two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavity design supporting a wavelength-scale volume resonant mode with a calculated quality factor (Q) insensitive to deviations in the cavity geometry at the level of Q~2x10^4 is presented. The robustness of the cavity design is confirmed by optical fiber-based measurements of passive cavities fabricated in silicon. For microcavities operating in the lambda = 1500 nm wavelength band, quality factors between 1.3-4.0x10^4 are measured for significant variations in cavity geometry and for resonant mode normalized frequencies shifted by as much as 10% of the nominal value.
physics.optics:e investigate both experimentally and theoretically the waveguiding properties of a novel double trench waveguide where a conventional single-mode strip waveguide is embedded in a two dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) slab formed in silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers. We demonstrate that the bandwidth for relatively low-loss (50dB/cm) waveguiding is significantly expanded to 250nm covering almost all the photonic band gap owing to nearly linear dispersion of the TE-like waveguiding mode. The flat transmission spectrum however is interrupted by numerous narrow stop bands. We found that these stop bands can be attributed to anti-crossing between TE-like (positive parity) and TM-like (negative parity) modes. This effect is a direct result of the strong asymmetry of the waveguides that have an upper cladding of air and lower cladding of oxide. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of the effects of cladding asymmetry on the transmission characteristics of the PhC slab waveguides.
physics.optics:In this paper, we present an approximate expression for determining the effective permittivity describing the coherent propagation of an electromagnetic wave in random media. Under the Quasicrystalline Coherent Potential Approximation (QC-CPA), it is known that multiple scattering theory provided an expression for this effective permittivity. The numerical evaluation of this one is, however, a challenging problem. To find a tractable expression, we add some new approximations to the (QC-CPA) approach. As a result, we obtained an expression for the effective permittivity which contained at the same time the Maxwell-Garnett formula in the low frequency limit, and the Keller formula, which has been recently proved to be in good agreement for particles exceeding the wavelength.
physics.optics:We investigate the electromagnetic propagation in two-dimensional photonic crystals, formed by parallel dielectric cylinders embedded a uniform medium. The frequency band structure is computed using the standard plane-wave expansion method, while the propagation and scattering of the electromagnetic waves are calculated by the multiple scattering theory. It is shown that within partial bandgaps, the waves tend to bend away from the forbidden directions. Such a property may render novel applications in manipulating optical flows. In addition, the relevance with the imaging by flat photonic crystal slabs will also be discussed.
physics.optics:This paper is the result of setting up GRENOUILLE in the Nonlinear Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Maryland at College Park. With the experience acquired in the process of setting up GRENOUILLE, this manual was compiled from literature and from hand-on experience to serve as a quick guide, a step-by-step help to construct GRENOUILLE and to understand some of its basic principles.
physics.optics:Accurate knowledge of absorption coefficient of a sample is a prerequisite for measuring the third order optical nonlinearity of materials, which can be a serious limitation for unknown samples. We introduce a method, which measures both the absorption coefficient and the third order optical nonlinearity of materials with high sensitivity in a single experimental arrangement. We use a dual-beam pump-probe experiment and conventional single-beam z-scan under different conditions to achieve this goal. We also demonstrate a counterintuitive coupling of the non-interacting probe-beam with the pump-beam in pump-probe z-scan experiment.
physics.optics:The concept of a plane scatterer that was developed earlier for scalar waves is generalized so that polarization of light is included. Starting from a Lippmann-Schwinger formalism for vector waves, we show that the Green function has to be regularized before T-matrices can be defined in a consistent way. After the regularization, optical modes and Green functions are determined exactly for finite structures built up of an arbitrary number of parallel planes, at arbitrary positions, and where each plane can have different optical properties. The model is applied to the special case of finite crystals consisting of regularly spaced identical planes, where analytical methods can be taken further and only light numerical tasks remain. The formalism is used to calculate position- and orientation-dependent spontaneous-emission rates inside and near the finite photonic crystals. The results show that emission rates and reflection properties can differ strongly for scalar and for vector waves. The finite size of the crystal influences the emission rates. For parallel dipoles close to a plane, emission into guided modes gives rise to a peak in the frequency-dependent emission rate.
physics.optics:Single-shot ultrafast absorbance spectroscopy based on the frequency encoding of the kinetics is analyzed theoretically and implemented experimentally. The kinetics are sampled in the frequency domain using linearly chirped, amplified 33 fs FWHM pulses derived from a Ti:sapphire laser. A variable length grating pair compressor is used to achieve the time resolution of 500-1000 channels per a 2-to-160 ps window with sensitivity > 5x10-4. In terms of the acquisition time, FDSS has an advantage over the pump-probe spectroscopy in a situation when the "noise" is dominated by amplitude variations of the signal, due to the pump and flow instabilities. The possibilities of FDSS are illustrated with the kinetics obtained in multiphoton ionization of water and aqueous iodide and one-photon excitation of polycrystalline ZnSe and thin-film amorphous Si:H. Unlike other "single-shot" techniques, FDSS can be implemented for fluid samples flowing in a high-speed jet and for thin solid samples that exhibit interference fringes; no a priori knowledge of the excitation profile of the pump across the beam is needed. Another advantage is that due to the interference of quasimonochromatic components of the chirped probe pulse, an oscillation pattern near the origin of the FDSS kinetics emerges. This pattern is unique and can be used to determine the complex dielectric function of the photogenerated species.
physics.optics:Single-shot ultrafast absorbance spectroscopy based on the frequency encoding of the kinetics is analyzed theoretically and implemented experimentally. In Part II of the series, arbitrary thickness sample is analysed theroretically. The model is then used to simulate the results for a-Si:H films.
physics.optics:We present a unifying point of view which allows to understand spectral features reported in recent experiments with two-dimensional arrays of subwavelength holes in metal films. We develop a Fano analysis of the related scattering problem by distinguishing two interfering contributions to the transmission process, namely a non-resonant contribution (direct scattering) and a resonant contribution (surface plasmon excitation). The introduction of a coupling strength between these two contributions naturally induces resonance shifts and asymmetry of profiles which satisfy simple scaling relations. We also report an experiment to confirm this analysis.
physics.optics:We study the dispersion and leakage properties for the recently reported low-loss photonic band-gap fiber by Smith et al. [Nature 424, 657 (2003)]. We find that surface modes have a significant impact on both the dispersion and leakage properties of the fundamental mode. Our dispersion results are in qualitative agreement with the dispersion profile reported recently by Ouzounov et al. [Science 301, 1702 (2003)] though our results suggest that the observed long-wavelength anomalous dispersion is due to an avoided crossing (with surface modes) rather than band-bending caused by the photonic band-gap boundary of the cladding.
physics.optics:Micron-scale optical cavities are produced using a combination of template sphere self-assembly and electrochemical growth. Transmission measurements of the tunable microcavities show sharp resonant modes with a Q-factor>300, and 25-fold local enhancement of light intensity. The presence of transverse optical modes confirms the lateral confinement of photons. Calculations show sub-micron mode volumes are feasible. The small mode volume of these microcavities promises to lead to a wide range of applications in microlasers, atom optics, quantum information, biophotonics and single molecule detection.
physics.optics:We experimentally compare the optical bandwidth of a conventional single-mode fiber (SMF) with 3 different photonic crystal fibers (PCF) all optimized for visible applications. The spectral attenuation, single-turn bend loss, and mode-field diameters (MFD) are measured and the PCF is found to have a significantly larger bandwidth than the SMF for an identical MFD. It is shown how this advantage can be utilized for realizing a larger MFD for the PCF while maintaining a bending resistant fiber.
physics.optics:We consider an air-silica honeycomb lattice and demonstrate a new approach to the formation of a core defect. Typically, a high or low-index core is formed by adding a high-index region or an additional air-hole (or other low-index material) to the lattice, but here we discuss how a core defect can be formed by manipulating the cladding region rather than the core region itself. Germanium-doping of the honeycomb lattice has recently been suggested for the formation of a photonic band-gap guiding silica-core and here we experimentally demonstrate how an index-guiding silica-core can be formed by fluorine-doping of the honeycomb lattice.
physics.optics:Self-similar propagation of ultrashort, parabolic pulses in a laser resonator is observed theoretically and experimentally. This constitutes a new type of pulse-shaping in modelocked lasers: in contrast to the well-known static (soliton-like) and breathing (dispersion-managed soliton) pulse evolutions, asymptotic solutions to the nonlinear wave equation that governs pulse propagation in most of the laser cavity are observed. Stable self-similar pulses exist with energies much greater than can be tolerated in soliton-like pulse shaping, and this will have implications for practical lasers.
physics.optics:The existence of resonant enhanced transmission and collimation of light waves by subwavelength slits in metal films [for example, see T.W. Ebbesen et al., Nature (London) 391, 667 (1998) and H.J. Lezec et al., Science, 297, 820 (2002)] leads to the basic question: Can a light be enhanced and simultaneously localized in space and time by a subwavelength slit? To address this question, the spatial distribution of the energy flux of an ultrashort (femtosecond) wave-packet diffracted by a subwavelength (nanometer-size) slit was analyzed by using the conventional approach based on the Neerhoff and Mur solution of Maxwell's equations. The results show that a light can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the near-field diffraction zone at the nm- and fs-scales. Possible applications in nanophotonics are discussed.
physics.optics:We demonstrate an optical system that can apply and accurately measure the torque exerted by the trapping beam on a rotating birefringent probe particle. This allows the viscosity and surface effects within liquid media to be measured quantitatively on a micron-size scale using a trapped rotating spherical probe particle. We use the system to measure the viscosity inside a prototype cellular structure.
physics.optics:The core theorem on which the above paper is centred - that a perfectly conducting body of revolution absorbs no angular momentum from an axisymmetric electromagnetic wave field - is in fact a special case of a more general result in electromagnetic scattering theory. In addition, the scaling of the efficiency of transfer of angular momentum to an object with the wavelength and object size merits further discussion. Finally, some comments are made on the choice of terminology and the erroneous statement that a circularly polarized plane wave does not carry angular momentum.
physics.optics:The propagation of plane waves in a Faraday chiral medium is investigated. Conditions for the phase velocity to be directed opposite to the direction of power flow are derived for propagation in an arbitrary direction; simplified conditions which apply to propagation parallel to the distinguished axis are also established. These negative phase-velocity conditions are explored numerically using a representative Faraday chiral medium, arising from the homogenization of an isotropic chiral medium and a magnetically biased ferrite. It is demonstrated that the phase velocity may be directed opposite to power flow, provided that the gyrotropic parameter of the ferrite component medium is sufficiently large compared with the corresponding nongyrotropic permeability parameters.
physics.optics:Second harmonic optical coherence tomography, which uses coherence gating of second-order nonlinear optical response of biological tissues for imaging, is described and demonstrated. Femtosecond laser pulses were used to excite second harmonic waves from collagen harvested from rat tail tendon and a reference nonlinear crystal. Second harmonic interference fringe signals were detected and used for image construction. Because of the strong dependence of second harmonic generation on molecular and tissue structures, this technique offers contrast and resolution enhancement to conventional optical coherence tomography.
physics.optics:Considering the diffraction of a plane wave by a periodically corrugated half-space, we show that the transformation of the refracting medium from positive/negative phase-velocity to negative/positive phase-velocity type has an influence on the diffraction efficiencies. This effect increases with increasing corrugation depth, owing to the presence of evanescent waves in the troughs of the corrugated interface.
physics.optics:We have developed a scheme to measure the optical torque, exerted by a laser beam on a phase object, by measuring the orbital angular momentum of the transmitted beam. The experiment is a macroscopic simulation of a situation in optical tweezers, as orbital angular momentum has been widely used to apply torque to microscopic objects. A hologram designed to generate LG02 modes and a CCD camera are used to detect the orbital component of the beam. Experimental results agree with theoretical numerical calculations, and the strength of the orbital component suggest its usefulness in optical tweezers for micromanipulation.
physics.optics:We investigate optical parametric oscillations through four-wave mixing in resonant cavities and photonic crystals. The theoretical analysis underlines the relevant features of the phenomenon and the role of the density of states. Using fully vectorial 3D time-domain simulations, including both dispersion and nonlinear polarization, for the first time we address this process in a face centered cubic lattice and in a photonic crystal slab. The results lead the way to the development of novel parametric sources in isotropic media.
physics.optics:We present a study of orbital angular momentum transfer from pump to down-converted beams in a type-II Optical Parametric Oscillator. Cavity and anisotropy effects are investigated and demostrated to play a central role in the transverse mode dynamics. While the idler beam can oscillate in a Laguerre-Gauss mode, the crystal birefringence induces an astigmatic effect in the signal beam that prevents the resonance of such mode.
physics.optics:We introduce a prototype model for globally-coupled oscillators in which each element is given an oscillation frequency and a preferential oscillation direction (polarization), both randomly distributed. We found two collective transitions: to phase synchronization and to polarization ordering. Introducing a global-phase and a polarization order parameters, we show that the transition to global-phase synchrony is found when the coupling overcomes a critical value and that polarization order enhancement can not take place before global-phase synchrony. We develop a self-consistent theory to determine both order parameters in good agreement with numerical results.
physics.optics:We report on a polarization maintaining large mode area photonic crystal fiber. Unlike, previous work on polarization maintaining photonic crystal fibers, birefringence is introduced using stress applying parts. This has allowed us to realize fibers, which are both single mode at any wavelength and have a practically constant birefringence for any wavelength. The fibers presented in this work have mode field diameters from about 4 to 6.5 micron, and exhibit a typical birefringence of 1.5e-4.
physics.optics:Speden is a computer program that reconstructs the electron density of single particles from their x-ray diffraction patterns, using a single-particle adaptation of the Holographic Method in crystallography. (Szoke, A., Szoke, H., and Somoza, J.R., 1997. Acta Cryst. A53, 291-313.) The method, like its parent, is unique that it does not rely on ``back'' transformation from the diffraction pattern into real space and on interpolation within measured data. It is designed to deal successfully with sparse, irregular, incomplete and noisy data. It is also designed to use prior information for ensuring sensible results and for reliable convergence. This article describes the theoretical basis for the reconstruction algorithm, its implementation and quantitative results of tests on synthetic and experimentally obtained data. The program could be used for determining the structure of radiation tolerant samples and, eventually, of large biological molecular structures without the need for crystallization.
physics.optics:We detect the vortex evolution from the increase of the fractional phase step by interfering two beams of opposite but equal fractional step increment.The interference pattern generated shows evidence of the birth of an additional single extra charge as the fractional phase step increase extends above a half-integer value
physics.optics:We report on a single-mode photonic crystal fiber with attenuation and effective area at 1550 nm of 0.48 dB/km and 130 square-micron, respectively. This is, to our knowledge, the lowest loss reported for a PCF not made from VAD prepared silica and at the same time the largest effective area for a low-loss (< 1 dB/km) PCF. We briefly discuss the future applications of PCFs for data transmission and show for the first time, both numerically and experimentally, how the group velocity dispersion is related to the mode field diameter
physics.optics:We resort to the concept of turns to provide a geometrical representation of the action of any lossless multilayer, which can be considered as the analogous in the unit disk to the sliding vectors in Euclidean geometry. This construction clearly shows the peculiar effects arising in the composition of multilayers. A simple optical experiment revealing the appearance of the Wigner angle is analyzed in this framework.
physics.optics:We examine the Seidel aberrations of thin spherical lenses composed of media with refractive index not restricted to be positive. We find that consideration of this expanded parameter space allows reduction or elimination of more aberrations than is possible with only positive index media. In particular we find that spherical lenses possessing real aplanatic focal points are possible only with negative index. We perform ray tracing, using custom code that relies only on Maxwell's equations and conservation of energy, that confirms the results of the aberration calculations.
physics.optics:We study coupling and decoupling of parallel waveguides in two-dimensional square-lattice photonic crystals. We show that the waveguide coupling is prohibited at some wavelengths when there is an odd number of rows between the waveguides. In contrast, decoupling does not take place when there is even number of rows between the waveguides. Decoupling can be used to avoid cross talk between adjacent waveguides.
physics.optics:We report on an easy-to-evaluate expression for the prediction of the bend-loss for a large mode area photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with a triangular air-hole lattice. The expression is based on a recently proposed formulation of the V-parameter for a PCF and contains no free parameters. The validity of the expression is verified experimentally for varying fiber parameters as well as bend radius. The typical deviation between the position of the measured and the predicted bend loss edge is within measurement uncertainty.
physics.optics:We proposed and realized a two-dimensional (2D) photonic bandedge laser surrounded by the photonic bandgap. The heterogeneous photonic crystal structure consists of two triangular lattices of the same lattice constant with different air hole radii. The photonic crystal laser was realized by room-temperature optical pumping of air-bridge slabs of InGaAsP quantum wells emitting at 1.55 micrometer. The lasing mode was identified from its spectral positions and polarization directions. A low threshold incident pump power of 0.24mW was achieved. The measured characteristics of the photonic crystal lasers closely agree with the results of real space and Fourier space calculations based on the finite-difference time-domain method.
physics.optics:The effect of lattice termination on the surface states in a two-dimensional truncated photonic crystal slab is experimentally studied in a high index contrast silicon-on-insulator system. A single-mode silicon strip waveguide that is separated from the photonic crystal by a trench of variable width is used to evanescently couple to surface states in the surrounding lattice. It is demonstrated that the dispersion of the surface states depends strongly on the specific termination of the lattice.
physics.optics:A new phasing algorithm has been used to determine the phases of diffuse elastic X-ray scattering from a non-periodic array of gold balls of 50 nm diameter. Two-dimensional real-space images, showing the charge-density distribution of the balls, have been reconstructed at 50 nm resolution from transmission diffraction patterns recorded at 550 eV energy. The reconstructed image fits well with scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the same sample. The algorithm, which uses only the density modification portion of the SIR2002 program, is compared with the results obtained via the Gerchberg-Saxton-Fienup HIO algorithm. In this way the relationship between density modification in crystallography and the HiO algorithm used in signal and image processing is elucidated.
physics.optics:Iterative projection algorithms for phase retrieval are tested on two simple toy models. The result provides useful insights in the behavior of these algorithms.
physics.optics:We demonstrate a technique for shaping current inputs for the direct modulation of a semiconductor laser for digital communication. The introduction of shaped current inputs allows for the suppression of relaxation oscillations and the avoidance of dynamical memory in the physical laser device, i.e., the output will not be influenced by previously communicated information. On the example of time-optimized bits, the possible performance enhancement for high data rate communications is shown numerically.
physics.optics:Phase-stabilized 12-fs, 1-nJ pulses from a commercial Ti:sapphire oscillator are directly amplified in a chirped-pulse optical parametric amplifier and recompressed to yield near-transform-limited 17.3-fs pulses. The amplification process is demonstrated to be phase preserving and leads to 85-uJ, carrier-envelope-offset phase-locked pulses at 1 kHz for 0.9 mJ of pump, corresponding to a single-pass gain of 8.5 x 10^4.
physics.optics:We have observed for the first time a new photonic quantum ring emission of anti-whispering gallery modes from a negative mesa-type toroid cavity due to semiconductor photonic corrals.
physics.optics:We predict that nonlinear left-handed metamaterials can support both TE- and TM-polarized self-trapped localized beams, spatial electromagnetic solitons. Such solitons appear as single- and multi-hump beams, being either symmetric or antisymmetric, and they can exist due to the hysteresis-type magnetic nonlinearity and the effective domains of negative magnetic permeability.
physics.optics:The use of one or more gold nanoballs as reference objects for Fourier Transform holography (FTH) is analysed using experimental soft X-ray diffraction from objects consisting of separated clusters of these balls. The holograms are deconvoluted against ball reference objects to invert to images, in combination with a Wiener filter to control noise. A resolution of ~30nm, smaller than one ball, is obtained even if a large cluster of balls is used as the reference, giving the best resolution yet obtained by X-ray FTH. Methods of dealing with missing data due to a beamstop are discussed. Practical prepared objects which satisfy the FTH condition are suggested, and methods of forming them described.
physics.optics:We study the transmission properties of a nonlinear periodic structure containing alternating slabs of a nonlinear right handed material and a linear left handed material. We find that the transmission associated with the zero averaged- refractive- index gap exhibits a bistable characteristic that is relatively insensitive to incident angle. This is in contrast to the nonlinear behavior of the usual Bragg gap
physics.optics:By use of an imaging spectrometer we map the far-field ($\theta-\lambda$) spectra of 200 fs optical pulses that have undergone beam collapse and filamentation in a Kerr medium. By studying the evolution of the spectra with increasing input power and using a model based on stationary linear asymptotic wave modes, we are able to trace a consistent model of optical beam collapse high-lighting the interplay between conical emission, multiple pulse splitting and other effects such as spatial chirp.
physics.optics:Periodic structures consisting of alternating layers of positive index and negative index materials possess a novel band gap at the frequency at which the average refractive index is zero. We show that in the presence of a Kerr nonlinearity, this zero-n gap can switch from low transmission to a perfectly transmitting state, forming a nonlinear resonance or gap soliton in the process. This zero-n gap soliton is omnidirectional in contrast to the usual Bragg gap soliton of positive index periodic structures
physics.optics:Experimental evidence of mode-selective evanescent power coupling at telecommunication frequencies with efficiencies up to 75 % from a tapered optical fiber to a carefully designed metal nanoparticle plasmon waveguide is presented. The waveguide consists of a two-dimensional square lattice of lithographically defined Au nanoparticles on an optically thin silicon membrane. The dispersion and attenuation properties of the waveguide are analyzed using the fiber taper. The high efficiency of power transfer into these waveguides solves the coupling problem between conventional optics and plasmonic devices and could lead to the development of highly efficient plasmonic sensors and optical switches.
physics.optics:In optical second harmonic generation with normal dispersion, the virtually infinite bandwidth of the unbounded, hyperbolic, modulational instability leads to quenching of spatial multi-soliton formation and to the occurrence of a catastrophic spatio-temporal break-up when an extended beam is let to interact with an extremely weak external noise with coherence time much shorter than that of the pump.
physics.optics:Interfering liquid surface waves are generated by electrically driven vertical oscillations of two or more equispaced pins immersed in a liquid (water). The corresponding intensity distribution, resulting from diffraction of monochromatic light by the reflection phase grating formed on the liquid surface, is calculated theoretically and found to tally with experiments. The curious features of the diffraction pattern and its relation to the interference of waves on the liquid surface are used to measure the amplitude and wavelength of the resultant surface wave along the line joining the two sources of oscillation. Finally, a sample diffraction pattern obtained by optically probing surface regions where interference produces a lattice--like structure is demonstrated and qualitatively explained.
physics.optics:We report polarization tomography experiments on metallic nanohole arrays with square and hexagonal symmetry. As a main result, we find that a fully polarized input beam is partly depolarized after transmission through a nanohole array. This loss of polarization coherence is found to be anisotropic, i.e. it depends on the polarization state of the input beam. The depolarization is ascribed to a combination of two factors: i) the nonlocal response of the array due to surface plasmon propagation, ii) the non-plane wave nature of a practical input beam.
physics.optics:Using analytical modeling and detailed numerical simulations, we investigate properties of hybrid systems of Photonic Crystal micro-cavities which incorporate a highly non-linear Ultra Slow Light medium. We demonstrate that such systems, while being miniature in size (order wavelength), and integrable, could enable ultra-fast non-linear all-optical switching at single photon energy levels.
physics.optics:We fabricated two dimensional photonic crystal structures in zinc oxide films with focused ion beam etching. Lasing is realized in the near ultraviolet frequency at room temperature under optical pumping. From the measurement of lasing frequency and spatial profile of the lasing modes, as well as the photonic band structure calculation, we conclude that lasing occurs in the strongly localized defect modes near the edges of photonic band gap. These defect modes originate from the structure disorder unintentionally introduced during the fabrication process.
physics.optics:One dimensional rectangular metallic gratings enable enhanced transmission of light for specific resonance frequencies. Two kinds of modes participating to enhanced transmission have already been demonstrated : (i) waveguide modes and (ii) surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). Since the original paper of Hessel and Oliner \cite{hessel} pointing out the existence of (i), no progress was made in their understanding. We present here a carefull analysis, and show that the coupling between the light and such resonances can be tremendously improved using an {\it evanescent} wave. This leads to enhanced localisation of light in cavities, yielding, in particular, to a very selective light transmission through these gratings.
physics.optics:We describe an experiment showing a spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon between the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary components of the fundamental field in intracavity type-II harmonic generation. It is based on a triply resonant dual cavity containing a type II phase matched $\chi^{(2)}$ crystal pumped at the fundamental frequency $\omega_0$. The pump beam generates in the cavity a second harmonic mode at frequency $2\omega_0$ which acts as a pump for frequency degenerate type II parametric down conversion. Under operating conditions which are precisely symmetric with respect to the ordinary and extraordinary components of the fundamental wave, we have observed a breaking of the symmetry on the intensities of these two waves in agreement with the theoretical predictions.
physics.optics:Unavoidable variations in size and position of the building blocks of photonic crystals cause light scattering and extinction of coherent beams. We present a new model for both 2 and 3-dimensional photonic crystals that relates the extinction length to the magnitude of the variations. The predicted lengths agree well with our new experiments on high-quality opals and inverse opals, and with literature data analyzed by us. As a result, control over photons is limited to distances up to 50 lattice parameters ($\sim 15 \mu$m) in state-of-the-art structures, thereby impeding large-scale applications such as integrated circuits. Conversely, scattering in photonic crystals may lead to novel physics such as Anderson localization and non-classical diffusion.
physics.optics:A semi-analytical method evaluates the error probability of DPSK signals with intrachannel four-wave-mixing (IFWM) in a highly dispersive fiber link with strong pulse overlap. Depending on initial pulse width, the mean nonlinear phase shift of the system can be from 1 to 2 rad for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty less than 1 dB. An approximated empirical formula, valid for penalty less than 2 dB, uses the variance of the differential phase of the ghost pulses to estimate the penalty.
physics.optics:The major sources causing deterioration of optical quality in extremely large optical telescopes are misadjustments of the mirrors, deformations of monolithic mirrors, and misalignments of segments in segmented mirrors. For active optics corrections, all three errors, which can partially compensate each other, are measured simultaneously. It is therefore of interest to understand the similarities and differences between the three corresponding types of modes which describe these errors. The first two types are best represented by Zernike polynomials and elastic modes respectively, both of them being continuous and smooth functions. The segment misaligment modes, which are derived by singular value decomposition, are by their nature not smooth and in general discontinuous. However, for mirrors with a large number of segments, the lowest modes become effectively both smooth and continuous. This paper derives analytical expressions for these modes, using differential operators and their adjoints, for the limit case of infinitesimally small segments. For segmented mirrors with approximately 1000 segments, it is shown that these modes agree well with the corresponding lowest singular value decomposition modes. Furthermore, the analytical expressions reveal the nature of the segment misalignment modes and allow for a detailed comparison with the elastic modes of monolithic mirrors. Some mathematical features emerge as identical in the two cases.
physics.optics:We report on remote delivery of 25 pJ broadband near-infrared femtosecond light pulses from a Ti:sapphire laser through 150 meters of single-mode optical fiber. Pulse distortion due to dispersion is overcome with pre-compensation using adaptive pulse shaping techniques, while nonlinearities are mitigated using an SF10 rod for the final stage of pulse compression. Near transform limited pulse duration of 130 fs is measured after the final compression.
physics.optics:High refractive index contrast optical microdisk resonators fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafers are studied using an external silica fiber taper waveguide as a wafer-scale optical probe. Measurements performed in the 1500 nm wavelength band show that these silicon microdisks can support whispering-gallery modes with quality factors as high as 5.2 x 10^5, limited by Rayleigh scattering from fabrication induced surface roughness. Microdisks with radii as small as 2.5 microns are studied, with measured quality factors as high as 4.7 x 10^5 for an optical mode volume of 5.3 cubic wavelengths in the material.
physics.optics:We develop and demonstrate two numerical methods for solving the class of open cavity problems which involve a curved, cylindrically symmetric conducting mirror facing a planar dielectric stack. Such dome-shaped cavities are useful due to their tight focusing of light onto the flat surface. The first method uses the Bessel wave basis. From this method evolves a two-basis method, which ultimately uses a multipole basis. Each method is developed for both the scalar field and the electromagnetic vector field and explicit ``end user'' formulas are given. All of these methods characterize the arbitrary dielectric stack mirror entirely by its 2\times2 transfer matrices for s- and p-polarization. We explain both theoretical and practical limitations to our method. Non-trivial demonstrations are given, including one of a stack-induced effect (the mixing of near-degenerate Laguerre-Gaussian modes) that may persist arbitrarily far into the paraxial limit. Cavities as large as 50 \lambda are treated, far exceeding any vectorial solutions previously reported.
physics.optics:We recently proposed two-dimensional coupled photonic crystal microcavity arrays as a route to achieve a slow-group velocity of light (flat band) in all crystal directions. In this paper we present the first experimental demonstration of such structures with a measured group velocity below 0.008c and discuss the feasibility of applications such as low-threshold photonic crystal lasers with increased output powers, optical delay components and sensors.
physics.optics:We present the design and fabrication of photonic crystal structures exhibiting electromagnetic bands that are flattened in all crystal directions, i.e., whose frequency variation with wavevector is minimized. Such bands can be used to reduce group velocity of light propagating in arbitrary crystal direction, which is of importance for construction of miniaturized tunable optical delay components, low-threshold photonic crystal lasers, and study of nonlinear optics phenomena.
physics.optics:By direct numerical simulations of the kinoform refractive lens within the quazioptical approach the effects of shape misalinement were investigated. The quazioptical approach was based on numerical integration of parabolic equation for complex wave amplitude by spep-by-step method with "splitting" procedure. The effect of 2pi- shift compensation was calculated for different orders and imperfections. The performance of kinoform lens was compared with the compound refractive lens and thin lens approximation.
physics.optics:We review a novel method for characterizing both the spectral and spatial properties of resonant cavities within two-dimensional photonic crystals (PCs). An optical fiber taper serves as an external waveguide probe whose micron-scale field is used to source and couple light from the cavity modes, which appear as resonant features in the taper's wavelength-dependent transmission spectrum when it is placed within the cavity's near field. Studying the linewidth and depth of these resonances as a function of the taper's position with respect to the resonator produces quantitative measurements of the quality factor Q and modal volume Veff of the resonant cavity modes. Polarization information about the cavity modes can be obtained by studying their depths of coupling when the cavity is probed along different axes by the taper. This fiber-based technique has been used to measure Q ~ 40,000 and Veff ~ 0.9 cubic wavelengths in a graded square lattice PC microcavity fabricated in silicon. The speed and versatility of this fiber-based probe is highlighted, and a discussion of its applicability to other wavelength-scale resonant elements is given.
physics.optics:Micro-domes based on a combination of metallic and dielectric multilayer mirrors are studied using a fully vectorial numerical basis-expansion method that accurately accounts for the effects of an arbitrary Bragg stack and can efficiently cover a large range of dome shapes and sizes. Results are examined from three different viewpoints: (i) the ray-optics limit, (ii) the (semi-) confocal limit for which exact wave solutions are known, and (iii) the paraxial approximation using vectorial Gaussian beams.
physics.optics:An overview is provided over the physics of dielectric microcavities with non-paraxial mode structure; examples are microdroplets and edge-emitting semiconductor microlasers. Particular attention is given to cavities in which two spatial degrees of freedom are coupled via the boundary geometry. This generally necessitates numerical computations to obtain the electromagnetic cavity fields, and hence intuitive understanding becomes difficult. However, as in paraxial optics, the ray picture shows explanatory and predictive strength that can guide the design of microcavities. To understand the ray-wave connection in such asymmetric resonant cavities, methods from chaotic dynamics are required.
physics.optics:We analyze theoretically the propagation of surface plasmon polaritons about a metallic corner with a finite bend radius, using a one-dimensional model analogous to the scattering from a finite-depth potential well. We obtain expressions for the energy reflection and transmission coefficients in the short wavelength limit, as well as an upper bound for the transmittance. In certain cases we find that propagation on non-planar interfaces may result in lower losses than on flat surfaces, contrary to expectation. In addition, we also find that the maximum transmittance depends non-monotonously on the bend radius, allowing increased transmission with decreasing radius.
physics.optics:This book chapter is the first part of a review of nanoporous materials for optical applications. Whereas the second part [J.Sauer, F. Marlow and F.Schueth, pp. 153-172 of the same volume] discusses material properties, this part gives a self-contained discussion of fluorescence and lasing in dielectric microresonators, with special emphasis on the hexagonal morphology found in molecular-sieve-dye compounds.
physics.optics:We address the formation and propagation of multi-spot soliton packets in saturable Kerr nonlinear media with an imprinted harmonic transverse modulation of the refractive index. We show that, in sharp contrast to homogeneous media where stable multi-peaked solitons do not exist, the photonic lattices support stable higher-order structures in the form of soliton packets, or soliton trains. Intuitively, such trains can be viewed as made of several lowest order solitons bound together with appropriate relative phases and their existence as stable objects puts forward the concept of compact manipulation of several solitons as a single entity.
physics.optics:The formation, deformation, and break-up of liquid interfaces are ubiquitous phenomena in nature. In the present article we discuss the deformation of a liquid interface produced by optical radiation forces. Usually, the bending of such an interface by the radiation pressure of a c.w. laser beam is weak. However, the effect can be enhanced significantly if one works with a near-critical phase-separated liquid mixture, whereby the surface tension becomes weak. The bending may in this way become as large as several tenths of micrometers, even with the use of only moderate laser power. This near-criticality is a key element in our experimental investigations as reviewed in the article. The effect is achieved by working with a micellar phase of microemulsions, at room temperature. We give a brief survey of the theory of electromagnetic forces on continuous matter, and survey earlier experiments in this area, such as the Ashkin-Dziedzic optical radiation force experiment on a water/air surface (1973), the Zhang-Chang experiment on the laser-induced deformation of a micrometer-sized spherical water droplet (1988), and the experiment of Sakai et al. measuring surface tensions of interfaces in a non-contact manner (2001). Thereafter, we survey results we obtained in recent years by performing experiments on near-critical interfaces, such as interface bending in the linear regime, stationary large deformations of liquid interfaces, asymmetric pressure effects on interfaces under intense illumination, nonlinear deformations, and laser-sustained liquid columns.
physics.optics:We introduce solitons supported by Bessel photonic lattices in cubic nonlinear media. We show that the cylindrical geometry of the lattice, with several concentric rings, affords unique soliton properties and dynamics. In particular, besides the lowest-order solitons trapped in the center of the lattice, we find soliton families trapped at different lattice rings. Such solitons can be set into controlled rotation inside each ring, thus featuring novel types of in-ring and inter-ring soliton interactions.
physics.optics:We present a novel general framework to deal with forward and backward components of the electromagnetic field in axially-invariant nonlinear optical systems, which include those having any type of linear or nonlinear transverse inhomogeneities. With a minimum amount of approximations, we obtain a system of two first-order equations for forward and backward components explicitly showing the nonlinear couplings among them. The modal approach used allows for an effective reduction of the dimensionality of the original problem from 3+1 (three spatial dimensions plus one time dimension) to 1+1 (one spatial dimension plus one frequency dimension). The new equations can be written in a spinor Dirac-like form, out of which conserved quantities can be calculated in an elegant manner. Finally, these new equations inherently incorporate spatio-temporal couplings, so that they can be easily particularized to deal with purely temporal or purely spatial effects. Nonlinear forward pulse propagation and non-paraxial evolution of spatial structures are analyzed as examples.
physics.optics:Metamaterials--artificially structured materials with tailored electromagnetic response--can be designed to have properties difficult to achieve with existing materials. Here we present a structured metamaterial, based on conducting split ring resonators (SRRs), which has an effective index-of-refraction with a constant spatial gradient. We experimentally confirm the gradient by measuring the deflection of a microwave beam by a planar slab of the composite metamaterial over a broad range of frequencies. The gradient index metamaterial represents an alternative approach to the development of gradient index lenses and similar optics that may be advantageous, especially at higher frequencies. In particular, the gradient index material we propose may be suited for terahertz applications, where the magnetic resonant response of SRRs has recently been demonstrated.
physics.optics:A recent advance in optical coherence tomography (OCT), termed swept-source OCT, is generalized into a new technique, Fourier-domain OCT. It represents a realization of a full-field OCT system in place of the conventional serial image acquisition in transverse directions typically implemented in "flying-spot" mode. To realize the full-field image acquisition, a Fourier holography system illuminated with a swept-source is employed instead of a Michelson interferometer commonly used in OCT. Fourier-domain OCT offers a new leap in signal-to-noise ratio improvement, as compared to flying-spot OCT systems. This paper presents experimental evidence that the signal-to-noise ratio of this new technique is indeed improved.
physics.optics:We show that a slab of meta-material (with $\epsilon=\mu=-1+i\Delta$) possesses a vortex-like surface wave with no ability to transport energy, whose nature is completely different from a localized mode or a standing wave. Through computations based on a rigorous time-dependent Green's function approach, we demonstrate that such a mode inevitably generates characteristic image oscillations in two dimensional focusing with even a monochromatic source, which were observed in many numerical simulations, but such oscillations are weak in three dimensional focusing.
physics.optics:The holographic imaging of rigid objects with diode lasers emitting in many wavelengths in a sillenite Bi12TiO20 photorefractive crystal is both theoretically and experimentally investigated. It is shown that, due to the multi-wavelength emission and the typically large free spectral range of this light source, contour fringes appear on the holographic image corresponding to the surface relief, even in single-exposure recordings. The influence of the number of emitted modes on the fringe width is analysed, and the possible applications of the contour fringes in the field of optical metrology are pointed out.
physics.optics:We develop a point-scattering approach to the plane-wave optical transmission of subwavelength metal hole arrays. We present a real space description instead of the more conventional reciprocal space description; this naturally produces interfering resonant features in the transmission spectra and makes explicit the tensorial properties of the transmission matrix. We give transmission spectra simulations for both square and hexagonal arrays; these can be evaluated at arbitrary angles and polarizations.
physics.optics:We derive phase-matching conditions for four-wave mixing between solitons and linear waves in optical fibres with arbitrary dispersion and demonstrate resonant excitation of new spectral components via this process.
physics.optics:We have experimentally studied polarization properties of the two-dimensional coupled photonic crystal microcavity arrays, and observed a strong polarization dependence of the transmission and reflection of light from the structures - the effects that can be employed in building miniaturized polarizing optical components. Moreover, by combining these properties with a strong sensitivity of the coupled bands on the surrounding refractive index, we have demonstrated a detection of small refractive index changes in the environment, which is useful for construction of bio-chemical sensors.
physics.optics:We demonstrate a new class of hollow-core Bragg fibers that are composed of concentric cylindrical silica rings separated by nanoscale support bridges. We theoretically predict and experimentally observe hollow-core confinement over an octave frequency range. The bandwidth of bandgap guiding in this new class of Bragg fibers exceeds that of other hollow-core fibers reported in the literature. With only three rings of silica cladding layers, these Bragg fibers achieve propagation loss of the order of 1 dB/m.
physics.optics:We analyze, by the finite-difference time-domain numerical methods, several ways to enhance the directional emission from photonic crystal waveguides through the beaming effect recently predicted by Moreno et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 121402(R) (2004)], by engineering the surface modes and corrugation of the photonic crystal surface. We demonstrate that the substantial enhancement of the light emission can be achieved by increasing the refractive index of the surface layer. We also measure power of surface modes and reflected power and confirm that the enhancement of the directional emission is related to the manipulation of the photonic crystal surface modes.
physics.optics:It is shown that the monochromatic optical wave propagating through the medium with linear birefringence in presence of a signal electromagnetic wave (whose wavelength is equal to the polarization beats length), displays Faraday rotation having the frequency of the signal wave and unsuppressed by linear birefringence. The effect is resonant with respect to the frequency of a signal wave. The "sharpness" of the resonance is defined by length of the birefringent medium.
physics.optics:Second harmonic generation in a two dimensional nonlinear quasi-crystal is demonstrated for the first time. Temperature and wavelength tuning of the crystal reveal the uniformity of the pattern while angle tuning reveals the dense nature of the crystal's Fourier spectrum. These results compare well with theoretical predictions showing the excellent uniformity of the crystal and suggest that more complicated ``nonlinear holograms'' should be possible.
physics.optics:We show analytically, and numerically that highly-dispersive media can be used to drastically increase lifetimes of high-Q microresonators. In such a resonator, lifetime is limited either by undesired coupling to radiation, or by intrinsic absorption of the constituent materials. The presence of dispersion weakens coupling to the undesired radiation modes and also effectively reduces the material absorption.
physics.optics:The Lorentz transformations for the optical constants (electric permittivity, magnetic permeability and index of refraction) of moving media are considered.
physics.optics:The existence of resonant enhanced transmission and collimation of light waves by subwavelength slits in metal films [for example, see T.W. Ebbesen et al., Nature (London) 391, 667 (1998) and H.J. Lezec et al., Science, 297, 820 (2002)] leads to the basic question: Can a light pulse be enhanced and simultaneously localized in space and time by a subwavelength slit? To address this question, the spatial distribution of the energy flux of an ultrashort (femtosecond) wave-packet diffracted by a subwavelength (nanometer-size) slit was analyzed by using the conventional approach based on the Neerhoff and Mur solution of Maxwell's equations. The results show that a light pulse can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the near-field diffraction zone at the nm- and fs-scales. Possible applications in nanophotonics are discussed.
physics.optics:We address the dynamics of higher-order solitons in optical lattices, and predict their self-splitting into the set of their single-soliton constituents. The splitting is induced by the potential introduced by the lattice, together with the imprinting of a phase tilt onto the initial multisoliton states. The phenomenon allows the controllable generation of several coherent solitons linked via their Zakharov-Shabat eigenvalues. Application of the scheme to the generation of correlated matter waves in Bose-Einstein condensates is discussed.
physics.optics:We report on a high-efficiency 461 nm blue light conversion from an external cavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation of a 922 nm diode laser with a quasi-phase-matched KTP crystal (PPKTP). By choosing a long crystal (LC=20 mm) and twice looser focusing (w0=43 $\mu$m) than the "optimal" one, thermal lensing effects due to the blue power absorption are minimized while still maintaining near-optimal conversion efficiency. A stable blue power of 234 mW with a net conversion efficiency of eta=75% at an input mode-matched power of 310 mW is obtained. The intra-cavity measurements of the conversion efficiency and temperature tuning bandwidth yield an accurate value d33(461 nm)=15 pm/V for KTP and provide a stringent validation of some recently published linear and thermo-optic dispersion data of KTP.
physics.optics:We consider an anisotropic homogenized composite medium (HCM) arising from isotropic particulate component phases based on ellipsoidal geometries. For cubically nonlinear component phases, the corresponding zeroth-order strong-permittivity-fluctuation theory (SPFT) (which is equivalent to the Bruggeman homogenization formalism) and second-order SPFT are established and used to estimate the constitutive properties of the HCM. The relationship between the component phase particulate geometry and the HCM constitutive properties is explored. Significant differences are highlighted between the estimates of the Bruggeman homogenization formalism and the second-order SPFT estimates. The prospects for nonlinearity enhancement are investigated.
physics.optics:Under certain circumstances, Voigt waves can propagate in a biaxial composite medium even though the component material phases individually do not support Voigt wave propagation. This phenomenon is considered within the context of the strong--permittivity--fluctuation theory. A generalized implementation of the theory is developed in order to explore the propagation of Voigt waves in any direction. It is shown that the correlation length--a parameter characterizing the distributional statistics of the component material phases--plays a crucial role in facilitating the propagation of Voigt waves in the homogenized composite medium.
physics.optics:In conventional approaches to the homogenization of random particulate composites, both the distribution and size of the component phase particles are often inadequately taken into account. Commonly, the spatial distributions are characterized by volume fraction alone, while the electromagnetic response of each component particle is represented as a vanishingly small depolarization volume. The strong-permittivity-fluctuation theory (SPFT) provides an alternative approach to homogenization wherein a comprehensive description of distributional statistics of the component phases is accommodated. The bilocally-approximated SPFT is presented here for the anisotropic homogenized composite which arises from component phases comprising ellipsoidal particles. The distribution of the component phases is characterized by a two-point correlation function and its associated correlation length. Each component phase particle is represented as an ellipsoidal depolarization region of nonzero volume. The effects of depolarization volume and correlation length are investigated through considering representative numerical examples. It is demonstrated that both the spatial extent of the component phase particles and their spatial distributions are important factors in estimating coherent scattering losses of the macroscopic field.
physics.optics:The polarization matrix ($2\times2$) obtained from two component eigen-spinors of spherical harmonics help us to evaluate the differential matrix $N$ of the anisotropic optical medium. The geometric phase is realized through {\it helicity} of photon, assuming the transmission of polarized light through the crystal which has been twisted about the normal to its surface over a closed path.
physics.optics:A circularly polarized rotationally symmetric paraxial laser beams carries hbar angular momentum per photon as spin. Focussing the beam with a rotationally symmetric lens cannot change this angular momentum flux, yet the focussed beam must have spin less than hbar per photon. The remainder of the original spin is converted to orbital angular momentum, manifesting itself as a longitudinal optical vortex at the focus. This demonstrates that optical orbital angular momentum can be generated by a rotationally symmetric optical system which preserves the total angular momentum of the beam.
physics.optics:The sign of the refractive index of any medium is soley determined by the requirement that the propagation of an electromagnetic wave obeys Einstein causality. Our analysis shows that this requirement predicts that the real part of the refractive index may be negative in an isotropic medium even if the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are both positive. Such a system may be a route to negative index media at optical frequencies. We also demonstrate that the refractive index may be positive in left-handed media that contain two molecular species where one is in its excited state.
physics.optics:This paper presents a novel approach to wave propagation inside the Fabry-Perot framework. It states that the time-averaged Poynting vector modulus could be nonequivalent with the squared-field amplitude modulus. This fact permits the introduction of a new kind of nonlinear medium whose nonlinearity is proportional to the time-averaged Poynting vector modulus. Its transmittance is calculated and found to differ with that obtained for the Kerr medium, whose nonlinearity is proportional to the squared-field amplitude modulus. The latter emphasizes the nonequivalence of these magnitudes. A space-time symmetry analysis shows that the Poynting nonlinearity should be only possible in noncentrosymmetric materials.
physics.optics:The resonant optical modes of a high permittivity dielectric prism with an equilateral triangular cross section are discussed. Eigenmode solutions of the scalar Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, appropriate to a conducting boundary, are applied for this purpose. The particular plane wave components present in these modes are analyzed for their total internal reflection behavior and implied mode confinement when the conducting boundary is replaced by a sharp dielectric mismatch. Improvement in TIR confinement by adjusting the longitudinal wavevector $k_z$ is also discussed. For two-dimensional electromagnetic solutions ($k_z=0$), TE polarization leads to longer lifetime than TM polarization, assuming that escape of evanescent boundary waves at the corners is the primary decay process.
physics.optics:We present a simple polarizing Mach-Zehnder interferometer that can be used for optimal minimal ellipsometry: Only four intensities are measured to determine the three Stokes parameters, and an optimal choice for the four polarization projections can be achieved for any sufficiently small wavelength range of interest.
physics.optics:Gold micro-mirrors have been formed in silicon in an inverted pyramidal shape. The pyramidal structures are created in the (100) surface of a silicon wafer by anisotropic etching in potassium hydroxide. High quality micro-mirrors are then formed by sputtering gold onto the smooth silicon (111) faces of the pyramids. These mirrors show great promise as high quality optical devices suitable for integration into MOEMS systems.
physics.optics:We demonstrate low-threshold random lasing in random amplifying layered medium via photon localization. Lasing is facilitated by resonant excitation of localized modes at the pump laser wavelength, which are peaked deep within the sample with greatly enhanced intensity. Emission occurs into long-lived localized modes overlapping the localized gain region. This mechanism overcomes a fundamental barrier to reducing lasing thresholds in diffusive random lasers, in which multiple scattering restricts the excitation region to the proximity of the sample surface.
physics.optics:The rate of linear collisionless damping (Landau damping) in a classical electron gas confined to a heated ionized thin film is calculated. The general expression for the imaginary part of the dielectric tensor in terms of the parameters of the single-particle self-consistent electron potential is obtained. For the case of a deep rectangular well, it is explicitly calculated as a function of the electron temperature in the two limiting cases of specular and diffuse reflection of the electrons from the boundary of the self-consistent potential. For realistic experimental parameters, the contribution of Landau damping to the heating of the electron subsystem is estimated. It is shown that for films with a thickness below about 100 nm and for moderate laser intensities it may be comparable with or even dominate over electron-ion collisions and inner ionization.
physics.optics:We propose and analyze a new type of a resonator in an annular geometry which is based on a single defect surrounded by radial Bragg reflectors on both sides. We show that the conditions for efficient mode confinement are different from those of the conventional Bragg waveguiding in a rectangular geometry. A simple and intuitive approach to the design of optimal radial Bragg reflectors is proposed and employed, yielding chirped gratings. Small bending radii and strong control over the resonator dispersion are possible by the Bragg confinement. A design compromise between large Free Spectral Range (FSR) requirements and fabrication tolerances is suggested.
physics.optics:Lasing at telecommunication wavelengths from annular resonators employing radial Bragg reflectors is demonstrated at room temperature under pulsed optical pumping. Sub milliwatt pump threshold levels are observed for resonators with 0.5-1.5 wavelengths wide defects of radii 7-8 mm. The quality factors of the resonator modal fields are estimated to be on the order of a few thousands. The electromagnetic field is shown to be guided by the defect. Good agreement is found between the measured and calculated spectrum.
physics.optics:We address Bessel photonic lattices of radial symmetry imprinted in cubic Kerr-type nonlinear media and show that they support families of stable dipole-mode solitons featuring two out-of-phase light spots located in different lattice rings. We show that the radial symmetry of the Bessel lattices afford a variety of unique soliton dynamics including controlled radiation-free rotation of the dipole-mode solitons.
physics.optics:Criteria for experimental observation of multi-dimensional optical solitons in media with saturable refractive nonlinearities are developed. The criteria are applied to actual material parameters (characterizing the cubic self-focusing and quintic self-defocusing nonlinearities, two-photon loss, and optical-damage threshold) for various glasses. This way, we identify operation windows for soliton formation in these glasses. It is found that two-photon absorption sets stringent limits on the windows. We conclude that, while a well-defined window of parameters exists for two-dimensional solitons (spatial or spatiotemporal), for their three-dimensional spatiotemporal counterparts such a window \emph{does not} exist, due to the nonlinear loss in glasses.
physics.optics:We report the observation of the self-guided propagation of 120 fs, 0.56 mJ infrared radiation in air for distances greater than one meter. In contrast to the known case of filamentation, in the present experiment the laser power is lower than the collapse threshold. Therefore the counter balance between Kerr self focussing and ionization induced defocussing as the stabilizing mechanism is ruled out. Instead, we find evidences of a process in which the transversal beam distribution reshapes into a form similar to a Townes soliton. We include numerical support for this conclusion.
physics.optics:We consider a plane electromagnetic wave incident on a periodic stack of dielectric layers. One of the alternating layers has an anisotropic refractive index with an oblique orientation of the principal axis relative to the normal to the layers. It was shown recently (A. Figotin and I. Vitebskiy, Phys. Rev. E68, 036609 2003) that an obliquely incident light, upon entering such a periodic stack, can be converted into an abnormal axially frozen mode with drastically enhanced amplitude and zero normal component of the group velocity. The stack reflectivity at this point can be very low, implying nearly total conversion of the incident light into the frozen mode with huge energy density, compared to that of the incident light. Supposedly, the frozen mode regime requires strong birefringence in the anisotropic layers - by an order of magnitude stronger than that available in common anisotropic dielectric materials. In this paper we show how to overcome the above problem by exploiting higher frequency bands of the photonic spectrum. We prove that a robust frozen mode regime at optical wavelengths can be realized in stacks composed of common anisotropic materials, such as YVO&#8324;, LiNb, CaCO&#8323;, and the like.
physics.optics:The paper aims at presenting a didactic and self-contained overview of Gauss-Hermite and Gauss-Laguerre laser beam modes. The usual textbook approach for deriving these modes is to solve the Helmoltz electromagnetic wave equation within the paraxial approximation. Here, a different technique is presented: Using the plane wave representation of the fundamental Gaussian mode as seed function, all higher-order beam modes are derived by acting with differential operators on this fundamental solution. Even special beam modes as the recently introduced Bessel beams are easily described within that framework.
physics.optics:This letter presents a comparison of exact probability density function with the Gaussian noise approximation in optically pre-amplified DPSK receivers with optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer demodulation (MZI) and balanced detection, including the impact of phase noise. It is found that the Gaussian noise approximation significantly over-estimates ASE-ASE beat noise in DPSK receivers with balanced detection particularly when phase noise is negligible, compared to IM/DD receivers, ASE- amplified spontaneous emission. However, the Gaussian noise approximation is still applicable for DPSK receivers with balanced detection and the measured 3-dB advantage is predicted by the Gaussian noise distribution.
physics.optics:Spatial Kerr solitons, typically associated with the standard paraxial nonlinear Schroedinger equation, are shown to exist to all nonparaxial orders, as exact solutions of Maxwell's equations in the presence of vectorial Kerr effect. More precisely, we prove the existence of azimuthally polarized, spatial, dark soliton solutions of Maxwell's equations, while exact linearly polarized (2+1)-D solitons do not exist. Our ab initio approach predicts the existence of dark solitons up to an upper value of the maximum field amplitude, corresponding to a minimum soliton width of about one fourth of the wavelength.
physics.optics:In any polarimetric measurement technique, enhancing the laser polarization change of a laser beam before it reaches the analyzer can help in improving the sensitivity. This can be performed using an optical component having a large linear dichroism, the enhancement factor being equal to the square root of the ratio of the two transmission factors. A pile of parallel plates at Brewster incidence looks appropriate for realizing such a polarization magnifier. In this paper, we address the problem raised by the interference in the plates and between the plates, which affects the measurement by giving rise to birefringence. We demonstrate that wedged plates provide a convenient and efficient way to avoid this interference. We have implemented and characterized devices with 4 and 6 wedged plates at Brewster incidence which have led to a decisive improvement of the signal to noise ratio in our ongoing Parity Violation measurement.
physics.optics:A catadioptric sensor induces a projection between a given object surface and an image plane. The prescribed projection problem is the problem of finding a catadioptric sensor that realizes a given projection. Here we present a functional that describes the image error induced by a given mirror when compared with a given projection. This expression can be minimized to find solutions to the prescribed projection problem. We present an example of this approach, by finding the optimum spherical mirror that serves as a passenger side mirror on a motor vehicle.
physics.optics:The various non-linear transformations incurred by the rays in an optical system can be modelled by matrix products up to any desired order of approximation. Mathematica software has been used to find the appropriate matrix coefficients for the straight path transformation and for the transformations induced by conical surfaces, both direction change and position offset. The same software package was programmed to model optical systems in seventh-order. A Petzval lens was used to exemplify the modelling power of the program.
physics.optics:The non-linear transformations incurred by the rays in an optical system can be suitably described by matrices to any desired order of approximation. In systems composed of uniform refractive index elements, each individual ray refraction or translation has an associated matrix and a succession of transformations correspond to the product of the respective matrices. This paper describes a general method to find the matrix coefficients for translation and surface refraction irrespective of the surface shape or the order of approximation. The choice of coordinates is unusual as the orientation of the ray is characterised by the direction cosines, rather than slopes; this is shown to greatly simplify and generalise coefficient calculation. Two examples are shown in order to demonstrate the power of the method: The first is the determination of seventh order coefficients for spherical surfaces and the second is the determination of third order coefficients for a toroidal surface.
physics.optics:Current quantum cascade lasers based upon conduction band electron transitions are predominantly TM (electrical field normal to the epitaxial direction) polarized. Here we present a study of localized defect modes, with the requisite TM polarization, in connected square and hexagonal lattice two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals for application as quantum cascade laser resonators. A simple group-theory based analysis is used to produce an approximate description of the resonant modes supported by defects situated at different high symmetry points within the host photonic lattice. The results of this analysis are compared with 2D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, showing a close correspondence between the two analyses, and potential applications of the analysis in quantum cascade laser design are considered.
physics.optics:We present an analysis of quantum-limited DPSK receivers with optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) demodulation. It is shown for the first time that the quantum limits for DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port and balanced detections exactly differ from 3-dB in receiver sensitivity, obtained by both Poisson and Gaussian noise statistics.
physics.optics:This paper discusses free carrier generation by pulsed laser fields as a mechanism to switch the optical properties of semiconductor photonic crystals and bulk semiconductors on an ultrafast time scale. Requirements are set for the switching magnitude, the time-scale, the induced absorption as well as the spatial homogeneity, in particular for silicon at lambda= 1550 nm. Using a nonlinear absorption model, we calculate carrier depth profiles and define a homogeneity length l_hom. Homogeneity length contours are visualized in a plane spanned by the linear and two-photon absorption coefficients. Such a generalized homogeneity plot allows us to find optimum switching conditions at pump frequencies near v/c= 5000 cm^{-1} (lambda= 2000 nm). We discuss the effect of scattering in photonic crystals on the homogeneity. We experimentally demonstrate a 10% refractive index switch in bulk silicon within 230 fs with a lateral homogeneity of more than 30 micrometers. Our results are relevant for switching of modulators in absence of photonic crystals.
physics.optics:A theoretical investigation on the quantum control of optical coherent four-wave mixing interactions in two-level systems driven by two intense synchronized femtosecond laser pulses of central angular frequencies $\omega$ and $3\omega$ is reported. By numerically solving the full Maxwell-Bloch equations beyond the slowly-varying envelope and rotating-wave approximations in the time domain, the nonlinear coupling to the optical field at frequency $5\omega$ is found to depend critically on the initial relative phase $\phi$ of the two propagating pulses; the coupling is enhanced when the pulses interfere constructively in the center ($\phi=0$), while it is nearly suppressed when they are out of phase ($\phi=\pi$). The tuning of the initial absolute phase of the different frequency components of synchronously propapagating $\omega$-$3\omega$ femtosecond pulses can serve as a means to control coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) processes.
physics.optics:We address azimuthally modulated Bessel optical lattices imprinted in focusing cubic Kerr-type nonlinear media, and reveal that such lattices support different types of stable solitons, whose complexity increases with growth of lattice order. We reveal that the azimuthally modulated lattices cause single solitons launched tangentially to the guiding rings to jump along consecutive sites of the optical lattice. The position of the output channel can be varied by small changes of the launching angle.
physics.optics:This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive study of noise statistics by use pdf.
physics.optics:We prove that spatial Kerr solitons, usually obtained in the frame of nonlinear Schroedinger equation valid in the paraxial approximation, can be found in a generalized form as exact solutions of Maxwell's equations. In particular, they are shown to exist, both in the bright and dark version, as linearly polarized exactly integrable one-dimensional solitons, and to reduce to the standard paraxial form in the limit of small intensities. In the two-dimensional case, they are shown to exist as azimuthally polarized circularly symmetric dark solitons. Both one and two-dimensional dark solitons exhibit a characteristic signature in that their asymptotic intensity cannot exceed a threshold value in correspondence of which their width reaches a minimum subwavelength value.
physics.optics:The idea of working with a near-critical phase-separated liquid mixture whereby the surface tension becomes weak, has recently made the field of laser manipulation of liquid interfaces a much more convenient tool in practice. The deformation of interfaces may become as large as several tenths of micrometers, even with the use of conventional laser power. This circumstance necessitates the use of nonlinear geometrical theory for the description of surface deformations. The present paper works out such a theory, for the surface deformation under conditions of axial symmetry and stationarity. Good agreement is found with the experimental results of Casner and Delville [A. Casner and J. P. Delville, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 87}, 054503 (2001); Opt. Lett. {\bf 26}, 1418 (2001); Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 90}, 144503 (2003)], in the case of moderate power or a broad laser beam. In the case of large power and a narrow beam, corresponding to surface deformations of about 50 micrometers or higher, the theory is found to over-predict the deformation. Possible explanations of this discrepancy are discussed.
physics.optics:Maxwell equations are solved in a layer comprising a finite number of homogeneous isotropic dielectric regions ended by anisotropic perfectly matched layers (PMLs). The boundary-value problem is solved and the dispersion relation inside the PML is derived. The general expression of the eigenvalues equation for an arbitrary number of regions in each layer is obtained, and both polarization modes are considered. The modal functions of a single layer ended by PMLs are found, and their orthogonality relation is derived. The present method is useful to simulate scattering problems from dielectric objects as well as propagation in planar slab waveguides. Its potential to deal with more complex problems such as the scattering from an object with arbitrary cross section in open space using the multilayer modal method is briefly discussed.
physics.optics:An analytical expression for the self coherence function of a microcavity and partially coherent source is derived from first principles in terms of the component self coherence functions. Excellent agreement between the model and experimental measurements of two Resonant Cavity LEDs (RCLEDs) is evident. The variation of coherence length as a function of numerical aperture is also described by the model. This is explained by a microcavity's angular sensitivity in filtering out statistical fluctuations of the underlying light source. It is further demonstrated that the variable coherence properties of planar microcavities can be designed by controlling the underlying coherences of microcavity and emitter whereby coherence lengths ranging over nearly an order of magnitude could be achieved.
physics.optics:Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in ultra-high-Q surface-tension-induced spherical and chip-based toroid microcavities is considered both theoretically and experimentally. These microcavities are fabricated from silica, exhibit small mode volume (typically 1000 $\mu m^{3}$) and possess whispering-gallery type modes with long photon storage times (in the range of 100 ns), significantly reducing the threshold for stimulated nonlinear optical phenomena. Oscillation threshold levels of less than 100 $\mu $% -Watts of launched fiber pump power, in microcavities with quality factors of 100 million are observed. Using a steady state analysis of the coupled-mode equations for the pump and Raman whispering-gallery modes, the threshold, efficiencies and cascading properties of SRS in UHQ devices are derived. The results are experimentally confirmed in the telecommunication band (1550nm) using tapered optical fibers as highly efficient waveguide coupling elements for both pumping and signal extraction. The device performance dependence on coupling, quality factor and modal volume are measured and found to be in good agreement with theory. This includes analysis of the threshold and efficiency for cascaded Raman scattering. The side-by-side study of nonlinear oscillation in both spherical microcavities and toroid microcavities on-a-chip also allows for comparison of their properties. In addition to the benefits of a wafer-scale geometry, including integration with optical, electrical or mechanical functionality, microtoroids on-a-chip exhibit single mode Raman oscillation over a wide range of pump powers.
physics.optics:We address soliton spiraling in optical lattices induced by multiple coherent Bessel beams and show that the dynamical nature of such lattices make them able to drag different soliton structures, setting them into rotation. The rotation rate can be controlled by varying the topological charges of lattice-inducing Bessel beams.
physics.optics:We investigate theoretically a fiber laser passively mode-locked with nonlinear polarization rotation. A unidirectional ring cavity is considered with a polarizer placed between two sets of a halfwave plate and a quarterwave plate. A master equation is derived and the stability of the continuous and mode-locked solutions is studied. In particular, the effect of the orientation of the four phase plates and of the polarizer on the mode-locking regime is investigated.
physics.optics:This paper presents an investigation of organic LED extraction efficiency enhancement using a low refractive index scattering layer. A scattering model is developed based on rigorous electromagnetic modelling techniques. The model accounts for proportions of scattered guided and radiation modes as well as the efficiencies with which emitted and scattered light are extracted. Constrained optimisation techniques are implemeneted for a single operation wavelength to maximise the extraction efficiency of a generic OLED device. Calculations show that a 2 fold efficiency enhancement is achievable with a correctly engineered scattering layer. The detailed analysis of the enhancement mechanism highlights ways in which this scheme could be improved.
physics.optics:It is reported that when a light beam travels through a slab of left-handed medium in the air, the lateral shift of the transmitted beam can be negative as well as positive. The necessary condition for the lateral shift to be positive is given. The validity of the stationary-phase approach is demonstrated by numerical simulations for a Gaussian-shaped beam. A restriction to the slab's thickness is provided that is necessary for the beam to retain its profile in the traveling. It is shown that the lateral shift of the reflected beam is equal to that of the transmitted beam in the symmetric configuration.
physics.optics:We present an experimental technique enabling mechanical-noise free, cavity-enhanced frequency measurements of an atomic transition and its hyperfine structure. We employ the 532nm frequency doubled output from a Nd:YAG laser and an iodine vapour cell. The cell is placed in a traveling-wave Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) with counter-propagating pump and probe beams. The FPI is locked using the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique. Mechanical noise is rejected by differencing pump and probe signals. In addition, this differenced error signal gives a sensitive measure of differential non-linearity within the FPI.
physics.optics:Soliton propagation is usually described in the ``slowly varying envelope approximation'' (SVEA) regime, which is not applicable for ultrashort pulses. We present theoretical results and numerical simulations for both NLS and parametric ($\chi^{(2)}$) ultrashort solitons in the ``generalised few-cycle envelope approximation'' (GFEA) regime, demonstrating their altered propagation.
physics.optics:Optical vortices generically arise when optical beams are combined. Recently, we reported how several laser beams containing optical vortices could be combined to form optical vortex loops, links and knots embedded in a light beam (Leach et al 2004). Here, we describe in detail the experiments in which vortex loops form these structures. The experimental construction follows a theoretical model originally proposed by Berry and Dennis, and the beams are synthesised using a programmable spatial light modulator and imaged using a CCD camera.
physics.optics:Absorption of light by a nanoparticle in the presence of resonant atom and fluorescence of the latter are theoretically investigated. It is shown, that absorption of light by a nanoparticle can be increased by several orders because of presence of atom. It is established, that optical bistability in such system is possible.
physics.optics:A time-domain approach is proposed for the propagation of ultrashort electro- magnetic wave packets beyond the paraxial and the slowly-varying-envelope approximations. An analytical method based on perturbation theory is used to solve the wave equation in free space without resorting to Fourier trans- forms. An exact solution is obtained in terms of successive temporal and spatial derivatives of a monochromatic paraxial beam. The special case of a radially polarized transverse magnetic wave packet is discussed.
physics.optics:We present in this paper a method to recover the refractive index profile of graded waveguide from the effective indices by cubic spline interpolation function. It is proved by numerical analysis of several typical index distributions that the refractive index profile can be reconstructed closely to its exact profile with the presented interpolation model. This method can reliably retrieve index profile of both more-mode (more than 4 guiding mode) and fewer-mode (2-4) waveguides.
physics.optics:Using femtosecond laser machining, we have fabricated photonic bandgap materials that influence propagation of phonon-polaritons in ferroelectric crystals. Broadband polaritons were generated with impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) using an ultrashort laser pulse, and the spatial and temporal evolution of the polaritons were imaged as they propagated through the fabricated structures with polariton real-space imaging. These techniques offer a new approach to optical materials design.
physics.optics:We study the effect of disorder on the effective magnetic response of composite left-handed metamaterials and their specific properties such as negative refraction. We show that relatively weak disorder in the split-ring resonators can reduce and even completely eliminate the frequency domain where the composite material demonstrates the left-handed properties. We introduce the concept of the order parameter to describe novel physics of this effect.
physics.optics:We studied both theoretically and experimentally the intensity distribution of a Gaussian laser beam when it was focussed by an objective lens with its numerical-aperture (NA) up to 0.95. Approximate formulae for full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity distribution at focus were derived for very large and very small initial beam waists with respect to the entrance pupil radius of the objective lens. In experiments the energy flux through a 0.5 micron pinhole was measured for various pinhole positions. We found that the FWHM's at focus in the transverse and the longitudinal directions do not increase much from the ultimate FWHM's until the input beam waist is reduced below the half of the entrance pupil radius. In addition, we observed significance of the spatial distribution of the input beam against a true Gaussian beam profile in the case of small initial beam waist. For high NA with resulting focal beam waists comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of the laser, the interaction between the electric field and the conducting surface of the pinhole caused the transverse FWHM to be measured slightly smaller than FWHM of the unperturbed intensity distribution convoluted with the pinhole opening.
physics.optics:The diffraction problem of a plane wave impinging on a grating formed by nested cavities is solved by means of the modal method, for $s$ and $p$ polarization modes. The cavities are formed by perfectly conducting sheets that describe rectangular profiles. The electromagnetic response of the grating is analyzed, paying particular attention to the generation of resonances within the structure. The dependence of the resonances on the geometrical parameters of the grating is studied, and results of far and near field are shown. The results are checked and compared with those available in the literature for certain limit cases.
physics.optics:We investigated the Onsager relations in the context of electromagnetic constitutive relations of linear, homogeneous materials. We determined that application of the Onsager relations to the constitutive equations relating $#P$ and $#M$ to both $#E$ and $#B$ is in accord with Lorentz reciprocity as well as the Post constraint.
physics.optics:We demonstrate femtosecond performance of an ultra-broadband high-index-contrast saturable Bragg reflector consisting of a silicon/silicon-dioxide/germanium structure that is fully compatible with CMOS processing. This device offers a reflectivity bandwidth of over 700 nm and sub-picosecond recovery time of the saturable loss. It is used to achieve mode-locking of an Er-Yb:glass laser centered at 1540 nm, generating 220 fs pulses, with the broadest output spectrum to date.
physics.optics:We study the electromagnetic beam reflection from layered structures that include the so-called double-negative materials, also called left-handed metamaterials. We predict that such structures can demonstrate a giant lateral Goos-Hanchen shift of the scattered beam accompanied by splitting of the reflected and transmitted beams due to the resonant excitation of surface waves at the interfaces between the conventional and double-negative materials as well as due to excitation of leaky modes in the layered structures. The beam shift can be either positive or negative, depending on the type of the guided waves excited by the incoming beam. We also perform finite-difference time-domain simulations and confirm the major effects predicted analytically.
physics.optics:We derive coupled nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (CNLSE) for arbitrary polarized light propagation in a single-mode fiber. We introduce a basis of transverse eigen modes with the appropriate projecting hence solutions depend on the waveguide geometry. Considering a weak nonlinearity which is connected with Kerr effect, we give explicit expressions for nonlinear constants via integrals of Bessel functions. We compare numerical results for the nonlinear constant extracted from experimental observations of a soliton for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) (single-mode one). The method of projecting we use allows a direct generalization to multi-mode fiber case.
physics.optics:We study nonlinear transmission of an asymmetric multilayer structure created by alternating slabs of two materials with positive and negative refractive index. We demonstrate that such a structure exhibits passive spatially nonreciprocal transmission of electromagnetic waves, the analogue of the electronic diode. We study the properties of this left-handed diode and confirm its highly nonreciprocal and bistable transmittance by employing direct simulations.
physics.optics:We investigate resonant nonlinear optical interactions and demonstrate induced transparency in acetylene molecules in a hollow-core photonic band-gap fiber at 1.5$\mu$m. The induced spectral transmission window is used to demonstrate slow-light effects, and we show that the observed broadening of the spectral features is due to collisions of the molecules with the inner walls of the fiber core. Our results illustrate that such fibers can be used to facilitate strong coherent light-matter interactions even when the optical response of the individual molecules is weak.
physics.optics:We reveal the existence of dynamically stable composite topological solitons in Bessel photonic lattices imprinted in focusing Kerr-type nonlinear media. The new stable composite solitons are made of a vortex-ring with unit topological charge incoherently coupled to a fundamental soliton. The stabilization of the otherwise highly azimuthally unstable vortex-rings is provided under suitable conditions, which we study in detail, by cross-phase-modulation coupling with the fundamental soliton companion.
physics.optics:Stable ring vortex solitons, featuring a bright-shape, appear to be very rare in nature. However, here we show that they exist and can be made dynamically stable in defocusing cubic nonlinear media with an imprinted Bessel optical lattice. We find the families of vortex lattice solitons and reveal their salient properties, including the conditions required for their stability. We show that the higher the soliton topological charge, the deeper the lattice modulation necessary for stabilization.
physics.optics:Optical microcavities confine light spatially and temporally and find application in a wide range of fundamental and applied studies. In many areas, the microcavity figure of merit is not only determined by photon lifetime (or the equivalent quality-factor, Q), but also by simultaneous achievement of small mode volume V . Here we demonstrate ultra-high Q-factor small mode volume toroid microcavities on-a-chip, which exhibit a Q/V factor of more than $10^{6}(\lambda/n)^{-3}$. These values are the highest reported to date for any chip-based microcavity. A corresponding Purcell factor in excess of 200 000 and a cavity finesse of $2.8\times10^{6}$ is achieved, demonstrating that toroid microcavities are promising candidates for studies of the Purcell effect, cavity QED or biochemical sensing
physics.optics:Evolution of the main signal in a Lorentz dispersive medium is considered. The signal propagating in the medium is excited by a sine-modulated pulse signal, with its envelope described by a hyperbolic tangent function. Both uniform and non-uniform asymptotic representations for the signal are found. It is shown when the uniform representation can be reduced to the non-uniform one. The results obtained are illustrated with a numerical example.
physics.optics:Propagation of a Brillouin precursor in a Lorentz dispersive medium is considered. The precursor is excited by a sine modulated initial signal, with its envelope described by a hyperbolic tangent function. The purpose of the paper is to show how the rate of growth of the initial signal affects the form of the Brillouin precursor. Uniform asymptotic approach, pertinent to coalescing saddle points, is applied in the analysis. The results are illustrated with numerical examples.
physics.optics:A one-dimensional electromagnetic problem of Sommerfeld precursor evolution, resulting from a finite rise-time signal excitation in a dispersive Lorentz medium is considered. The effect of the initial signal rate of growth as well as of the medium dumping on the precursor shape and its magnitude is discussed. The analysis applied is based on an approach employing uniform asymptotic expansions. In addition, new approximate formulas are given for the location of the distant saddle points which affect local frequency and dumping of the precursor. The results obtained are illustrated numerically and compared with the results known from the literature.
physics.optics:We propose a new class of one-dimensional (1D) photonic waveguides: the fractal photonic crystal waveguides (FPCWs). These structures are photonic crystal waveguides (PCWs) etched with fratal distribution of grooves such as Cantor bars. The transmission properties of the FPCWs are investigated and compared with those of the conventional 1D PCWs. It is shown that the FPCW transmission spectrum has self-similarity properties associated with the fractal distribution of grooves. Furthermore, FPCWs exhibit sharp localized transmissions peaks that are approximately equidistant inside the photonic band gap.
physics.optics:We experimentally investigate the depolarizing power and the polarization entropy of a broad class of scattering optical media. By means of polarization tomography, these quantities are derived from an effective Mueller matrix, which is introduced through a formal description of the multi-mode detection scheme we use, as recently proposed by Aiello and Woerdman (arXiv:quant-ph/0407234). This proposal emphasized an intriguing universality in the polarization aspects of classical as well as quantum light scattering; in this contribution we demonstrate experimentally that this universality is obeyed by a surprisingly wide class of depolarizing media. This, in turn, provides the experimentalist with a useful characterization of the polarization properties of any scattering media, as well as a universal criterion for the validity of the measured data.
physics.optics:We present methods and results of the testing of an inexpensive home-made diffraction limited lens system, the design of which was proposed in a recent paper and which has since been used (with slight alterations) by several research groups. Our system will be used for both: focussing a collimated laser beam at a wavelength of lambda=830 nm down to a narrow spot and for collimating fluorescence light (lambda=780 nm) emitted from rubidium atoms captured in this spot. Useful tests for lens systems include the use of ray tracing software, shear-wave interferometers, the imaging of test charts and of polystyrene beads of a very small size. We present these methods and show how conclusions can be drawn for the design under test.
physics.optics:The propagation of plane waves in an isotropic chiral medium (ICM) is investigated. Simple conditions are derived--in terms of the constitutive parameters of the ICM--for the phase velocity to be directed opposite to the direction of power flow. It is demonstrated that phase velocity and power flow may be oppositely directed provided that the magnetoelectric coupling is sufficiently strong.
physics.optics:The paper examines superradiance in impurity crystals in the field of a coherent phonon wave excited by two ultrashort laser pulses via Raman scattering processes at the moment of preparation of the initial state of an ensemble of emitters. It is shown that by varying the power of the excitation pulses and their mutual direction of propagation, one can control the superradiance parameters and extract data on the electron-phonon coupling constant and its anisotropy.
physics.optics:The collective and single-electron amplification regimes of a non-collinear free electron laser are analyzed within the framework of dispersion equations. The small-signal gain and the conditions for self-amplified excitations are found. The collective excitations in a free electron laser are shown to be favored by the non-collinear arrangement of the relativistic electrons and the laser wave. Implications for free-electron lasing without inversion are discussed.
physics.optics:Using a 3D fully-vectorial nonlinear time-domain analysis we numerically investigate the generation of terahertz radiation by pumping a photonic crystal microcavity out of resonance. High quality factors and a quadratic susceptibility lead to few-cycle terahertz pulses via optical rectification. Material dispersion as well as linear and nonlinear anisotropy is fully accounted for.
physics.optics:We study the bandgap properties of two-dimensional photonic crystals created by a lattice of rods or holes conformed in a symmetric or asymmetric triangular structure. Using the plane-wave analysis, we calculate a minimum value of the refractive index contrast for opening both partial and full two-dimensional spectral gaps for both TM and TE polarized waves. We also analyze the effect of ellipticity of rods and holes and their orientation on the threshold value and the relative size of the bandgap.
physics.optics:We review the latest progress and properties of the families of bright and dark one-dimensional periodic waves propagating in saturable Kerr-type and quadratic nonlinear media. We show how saturation of the nonlinear response results in appearance of stability (instability) bands in focusing (defocusing) medium, which is in sharp contrast with the properties of periodic waves in Kerr media. One of the key results discovered is the stabilization of multicolor periodic waves in quadratic media. In particular, dark-type waves are shown to be metastable, while bright-type waves are completely stable in a broad range of energy flows and material parameters. This yields the first known example of completely stable periodic wave patterns propagating in conservative uniform media supporting bright solitons. Such results open the way to the experimental observation of the corresponding self-sustained periodic wave patterns.
physics.optics:We study the existence and stability of cnoidal periodic wave arrays propagating in uniform quadratic nonlinear media and discover that they become completely stable above a threshold light intensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in physics of completely stable periodic wave patterns propagating in conservative uniform media supporting bright solitons.
physics.optics:We consider photonic crystal fibers made from arbitrary base materials and derive a unified semi-analytical approach for the dispersion and modal properties which applies to the short-wavelength regime. In particular we calculate the dispersion and the effective index and comparing to fully-vectorial plane wave simulations we find excellent agreement. We also calculate asymptotic results for the mode-field diameter and the V-parameter and from the latter we predict that the fibers are endlessly single mode for a normalized air-hole diameter smaller than 0.42, independently of the base material.
physics.optics:We analyze an experimental setup in which a quasi-monochromatic spatially coherent beam of light is used to probe a paraxial optical scatterer. We discuss the effect of the spatial coherence of the probe beam on the Mueller matrix representing the scatterer. We show that according to the degree of spatial coherence of the beam, the \emph{same} scattering system can be represented by \emph{different} Mueller matrices. This result should serve as a warning for experimentalists.
physics.optics:In a recently published paper (J. of Modern Optics 50 (9) (2003) 1477-1486) a qualitative analysis of the moire effect observed by superposing two grids containing Cantor fractal structures was presented. It was shown that the moire effect is sensible to variations in the order of growth, dimension and lacunarity of the Cantor fractal. It was also verified that self-similarity of the original fractal is inherited by the moire pattern. In this work it is shown that these Cantor moire structures are also fractals and the fractal dimension associated with them is theoretically determined and experimentally measured attending the size of rhombuses in the different orders of growth.
physics.optics:We show that diffraction of electromagnetic radiation (in particular of a visible light) can disappear in propagation through materials with periodically in space modulated refraction index, i.e. photonic crystals. In this way the light beams of arbitrary width can propagate without diffractive broadening and, equivalently, arbitrary light patterns can propagate without diffractive smearing.
physics.optics:We consider a nonlinear optical system in general, and a broad aperture laser in particular in a resonator where the diffraction coefficients are of opposite signs along two transverse directions. The system is described by the hyperbolic Maxwell-Bloch equations, where the spatial coupling is provided by the DAlambert operator rather than by the Laplace operator. We show that this system supports hyperbolic transverse patterns residing on hyperbolas in far field domain, and consisting of stretched vortices in near field domain. These structures are described analytically by normal form analysis, and investigated numerically.
physics.optics:We present a novel, real-time, experimental technique for linear and nonlinear Brillouin zone spectroscopy of photonic lattices. The method relies on excitation with random-phase waves and far-field visualization of the spatial spectrum of the light exiting the lattice. Our technique facilitates mapping the borders of the extended Brillouin zones and the areas of normal and anomalous dispersion within each zone. For photonic lattices with defects (e.g., photonic crystal fibers), our technique enables far-field visualization of the defect mode overlaid on the extended Brillouin zone structure of the lattice. The technique is general and can be used for photonic crystal fibers as well as for periodic structures in areas beyond optics.
physics.optics:A novel class of circular resonators, based on a radial defect surrounded by Bragg reflectors, is studied in detail. Simple rules for the design and analysis of such structures are derived using a transfer matrix formalism. Unlike conventional ring resonators, annular Bragg resonators (ABR) are not limited by the total internal reflection condition, and can exhibit both large free spectral ranges and low bend losses. The Bragg reflection mechanism enables the confinement of light within a defect consisting of a low refractive index medium (such as air). Strong atom-photon interaction can be achieved in such a structure, making it a promising candidate for sensing and cavity QED applications. For sensing applications, we show that the ABR structure can possess significantly higher sensitivity when compared to a conventional ring resonator sensor. Lasing action and low threshold levels are demonstrated in ABR lasers at telecommunication wavelengths under pulsed optical pumping at room temperatures. The impact of the intensity and dimensions of the pump-spot on the emitted spectrum is studied in detail.

physics.optics:A Fourier-space based design approach for the systematic control of single and multiple photon localization states in a 1D lattice is presented. Resultant lattices are aperiodic in nature, such that lattice periodicity is not a useful optimization parameter to achieve novel field localization characteristics. Instead, direct control of field localization comes via control of the Parseval strength competition between the different Fourier components characterizing a lattice. This is achieved via an inverse optimization algorithm, tailoring the aperiodic lattice Fourier components to match that of a target Fourier distribution appropriate for the desired photonic localization properties. We present simulation results indicating the performance of a novel aperiodic lattice exhibiting a doubly-resonant high-Q characteristic.
physics.optics:We consider the resonant optical force acting on a pair of transparent microspheres by the excitation of the Morphology Dependent Resonance (MDR). The bonding and anti-bonding modes of the MDR correspond to strong attractions and repulsions respectively. The dependence of the force on separation and the role of absorption are discussed. At resonance, the force can be enhanced by orders of magnitude so that it will dominate over other relevant forces. We find that a stable binding configuration can be induced by the resonant optical force.

physics.optics:We generalize the projection to orthogonal function basis (including polarization modes) method for nonlinear (Kerr medium) fiber and use this method in a case of two-mode waveguide. We consider orthogonal Bessel functions basis that fit the choice of cylindrical geometry of a fiber. The coupled nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations (CNLS) are derived. Analytic expressions and numerical results for coupling coefficients are given; the fiber parameters dependence is illustrated by plots.
physics.optics:We report a detailed experimental study of vector modulation instability in highly birefringent optical fibers in the anomalous dispersion regime. We prove that the observed instability is mainly induced by vacuum fluctuations. The detuning of the spectral peaks agrees with linear perturbation analysis. The exact shape of the spectrum is well reproduced by numerical integration of stochastic nonlinear Schrodinger equations describing quantum propagation.
physics.optics:We study the transmission of a monochromatic "image" through a paraxial cavity. Using the formalism of self-transform functions, we show that a transverse degenerate cavity transmits the self-transform part of the image, with respect to the field transformation over one round-trip of the cavity. This formalism gives a new insight on the understanding of the behavior of a transverse degenerate cavity, complementary to the transverse mode picture. An experiment of image transmission through a hemiconfocal cavity show the interest of this approach.
physics.optics:The thermal radiation of small conducting particles was investigated in the region where the Stephan-Boltzmann law is not valid and strongly overestimates radiation losses. The new criterion for the particle size, at which black body radiation law fails, was formulated. The approach is based on the magnetic particle polarization, which is valid until very small sizes (cluster size) where due to drop of particle conductivity the electric polarization prevails over the magnetic one. It was also shown that the radiation power of clusters, estimated on the basis of the experimental data, is lower than that given by the Stephan-Boltzmann law.
physics.optics:We present an experimental and theoretical study of cascaded high order Stimulated Brillouin Scatterings (SBS) in single mode fibers. It is shown that because of the back-scattering nature of the process, feedback in the input port is needed for obtaining a significant cascaded effect in nonresonant systems. We also discuss similarities to nonlinear photorefractive processes.
physics.optics:We report experiments in which two photoluminescent samples of Strontium Aluminate pigments and Zinc Sulfide pebbles were quantum entangled via photoexcitation with entangled photons from a mercury lamp and a CRT screen. After photo-excitation, remote triggering of one of the sample with infrared (IR) photons yielded stimulated light variation from the quantum entangled other sample located 4 m away. The initial half-life of Strontium Aluminate is approximately one minute. However, molecules with a longer half-life may be found in the future. These experiments demonstrate that useful quantum information could be transferred through quantum channels via de-excitation of one sample of photoluminescent material quantum entangled with another.
physics.optics:We demonstrate a possibility to stabilize three-dimensional spatiotemporal solitons ("light bullets") in self--focusing Kerr media by means of a combination of dispersion management in the longitudinal direction (with the group-velocity dispersion alternating between positive and negative values) and periodic modulation of the refractive index in one transverse direction, out of the two. The analysis is based on the variational approximation (results of direct three-dimensional simulations will be reported in a follow-up work). A predicted stability area is identified in the model's parameter space. It features a minimum of the necessary strength of the transverse modulation of the refractive index, and finite minimum and maximum values of the soliton's energy. The former feature is also explained analytically.
physics.optics:We show that Coherent Population Oscillations effect allows to burn a narrow spectral hole (26Hz) within the homogeneous absorption line of the optical transition of an Erbium ion-doped crystal. The large dispersion of the index of refraction associated with this hole permits to achieve a group velocity as low as 2.7m/s with a ransmission of 40%. We especially benefit from the inhomogeneous absorption broadening of the ions to tune both the transmission coefficient, from 40% to 90%, and the light group velocity from 2.7m/s to 100m/s.
physics.optics:A novel open cavity formed by three 60-degree wedges of a photonic crystal with negative effective index is designed and studied. The quality factor of the open cavity can be larger than 2000. The influence of the interface termination on the resonant frequency and the quality factor is studied.
physics.optics:We report electro-absorption modulation of light at around 1550 nm in a unipolar InGaAlAs optical waveguide containing a InGaAs/AlAs double-barrier resonant tunneling diode (DB-RTD). The RTD peak-to-valley transition increases the electric field across the waveguide, which shifts the core material absorption band-edge to longer wavelengths via the Franz-Keldysh effect, thus changing the light-guiding characteristics of the waveguide. Low-frequency characterisation of a device shows modulation up to 28 dB at 1565 nm. When dc biased close to the negative differential conductance (NDC) region, the RTD optical waveguide behaves as an electro-absorption modulator integrated with a wide bandwidth electrical amplifier, offering a potential advantage over conventional pn modulators.
physics.optics:We propose a new scheme to achieve sub-Rayleigh resolution of interference pattern with independent laser beams. We perform an experimental observation of a double-slit interference with two orthogonally polarized laser beams. The resolution of the interference pattern measured by a two-photon detection is doubled provided the two beams illuminate the double-slit with certain incident angles. The scheme is simple and can be in favor of both high intensity and perfect visibility.
physics.optics:We recently reported on the first realization of ultraviolet photonic crystal laser based on zinc oxide [Appl. Phys. Lett. {\bf 85}, 3657 (2004)]. Here we present the details of structural design and its optimization. We develop a computational super-cell technique, that allows a straightforward calculation of the photonic band structure of ZnO photonic crystal slab on sapphire substrate. We find that despite of small index contrast between the substrate and the photonic layer, the low order eigenmodes have predominantly transverse-electric (TE) or transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization. Because emission from ZnO thin film shows strong TE preference, we are able to limit our consideration to TE bands, spectrum of which can possess a complete photonic band gap with an appropriate choice of structure parameters. We demonstrate that the geometry of the system may be optimized so that a sizable band gap is achieved.
physics.optics:We have performed near-field spectroscopy and microscopy of the InAs/AlGaAs quantum-dot-based nanoclusters. It is observed that the photoluminescence spectra of spatially confined excitons in the nanoclusters is blue-shifted up to 20 meV as the power density is increased. In particular, the near-field photoluminescence images have shown that excitons became spatially confined gradually from lower energy state (1.4150 eV) to higher energy state (1.4392 eV) as the excitation power is increased, which is indicative of the band-filling effect of semiconductor nanostructures.
physics.optics:We propose a novel method enabling to create a high-contrast dark resonance in the 87Rb vapor D2-line. The method is based on an optical pumping of atoms into the working states by a two-frequency, linearly-polarized laser radiation propagating perpendicularly to the probe field. This new scheme is compared to the traditional scheme involving the circularly-polarized probe beam only, and significant improvement of the dark resonance parameters is found. Qualitative considerations are confirmed by numerical calculations.
physics.optics:We demonstrate a dramatic change in the interaction forces between dark solitons in nonlocal nonlinear media. We present what we believe is the first experimental evidence of attraction of dark solitons. Our results indicate that attraction should be observable in other nonlocal systems, such as Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive long-range interparticle interaction.
physics.optics:We consider waveguides formed by single or multiple two-dimensional chaotic cavities connected to leads. The cavities are chaotic in the sense that the ray (or equivalently, classical particle) dynamics within them is chaotic. Geometrical parameters are chosen to produce a mixed phase space (chaotic regions surrounding islands of stability where motion is regular). Incoming rays (or particles) cannot penetrate into these islands but incoming plane waves dynamically tunnel into them at a certain discrete set of frequencies (energies). The support of the corresponding quasi-bound states is along the trajectories of periodic orbits trapped within the cavity. We take advantage of this difference in the ray/wave behavior to demonstrate how chaotic waveguides can be used to design beam splitters and microlasers. We also present some preliminary experimental results in a microwave realization of such chaotic waveguide.
physics.optics:We propose the construction of electromagnetic (or electronic) switches and beam splitters using chaotic two-dimensional multi-port waveguides. A prototype two-port waveguide is locally deformed in order to produce a ternary incomplete horseshoe proper of mixed phase space (chaotic regions surrounding islands of stability where motion is regular). Due to tunneling to the phase space stability islands the appearance of quasi-bound states (QBS) is induced. Then, we attach transversal ports to the waveguide on the deformation region in positions where the phase space structure is only slightly perturbed. We show how QBS can be guided out of the waveguide through the attached transversal ports giving rise to frequency selective switches and beam splitters.
physics.optics:We report on high-resolution photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of spatial structure of InAs/AlGaAs quantum dots (QDs) by using a near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM). The double-peaked distribution of PL spectra is clearly observed, which is associated with the bimodal size distribution of single QDs. In particular, the size difference of single QDs, represented by the doublet spectral distribution, can be directly observed by the NSOM images of PL.
physics.optics:We show that nonlinear phase shifts and third-order dispersion can compensate each other in short-pulse fiber amplifiers. In particular, we consider chirped-pulse fiber amplifiers at wavelengths for which the fiber dispersion is normal. The nonlinear phase shift accumulated in the amplifier can be compensated by the third-order dispersion of the combination of a fiber stretcher and grating compressor. A numerical model is used to predict the compensation, and initial experimental results that exhibit the main features of the calculations are presented. In the presence of third-order dispersion, an optimal nonlinear phase shift reduces the pulse duration, and enhances the peak power and pulse contrast compared to the pulse produced in linear propagation. Contrary to common belief, fiber stretchers can perform as well or better than grating stretchers in fiber amplifiers, while offering the major practical advantages of a waveguide medium. The relative benefits of a fiber stretcher increase with increasing pulse energy, so the results presented here will be relevant to fiber amplifiers designed for the highest pulse energies.
physics.optics:This paper is devoted to the theoretical and experimental demonstration of the possibility to perform time-resolved diffusing wave spectroscopy: we successfully registered field fluctuations for selected photon path lengths that can overpass 300 transport mean free paths. Such a performance opens new possibilities for biomedical optics applications.
physics.optics:An analytically expression for the temperature dependence of the signal gain of an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) pumped at 1480 \textit{nm} are theoretically obtained by solving the propagation equations with the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). It is seen that the temperature dependence of the gain strongly depends on the distribution of population of Er$^{3+}$-ions in the second level. In addition, the output pump power and the intrinsic saturation power of the signal beam are obtained as a function of the temperature. Numerical calculations are carried out for the temperature range from $-$ 20 to $+$ 60 \textit {$^{o}$C} and the various fiber lengths. But the other gain parameters, such as the pump and signal wavelengths and their powers, are taken as constants. It is shown that the gain decreases with increasing temperature within the range of $L\leq 27 m$.
physics.optics:We derive a coupled mode theory for the interaction of an optical cavity with a waveguide that includes waveguide dispersion. The theory can be applied to photonic crystal cavity waveguide structures. We derive an analytical solution to the add and drop spectra arising from such interactions in the limit of linear dispersion. In this limit, the spectra can accurately predict the cold cavity quality factor (Q) when the interaction is weak. We numerically solve the coupled mode equations for the case of a cavity interacting with the band edge of a periodic waveguide, where linear dispersion is no longer a good approximation. In this regime, the density of states can distort the add and drop spectra. This distortion can lead to more than an order of magnitude overestimation of the cavity Q.
physics.optics:We report a new computational method based on the recursive Green's function technique for calculation of light propagation in photonic crystal structures. The advantage of this method in comparison to the conventional finite-difference time domain (FDTD) technique is that it computes Green's function of the photonic structure recursively by adding slice by slice on the basis of Dyson's equation. This eliminates the need for storage of the wave function in the whole structure, which obviously strongly relaxes the memory requirements and enhances the computational speed. The second advantage of this method is that it can easily account for the infinite extension of the structure both into the air and into the space occupied by the photonic crystal by making use of the so-called "surface Green's functions". This eliminates the spurious solutions (often present in the conventional FDTD methods) related to e.g. waves reflected from the boundaries defining the computational domain. The developed method has been applied to study scattering and propagation of the electromagnetic waves in the photonic band-gap structures including cavities and waveguides. A particular attention has been paid to surface modes residing on a termination of a semi-infinite photonic crystal. We demonstrate that coupling of the surface states with incoming radiation may result in enhanced intensity of an electromagnetic field on the surface and very high Q factor of the surface state. This effect can be employed as an operational principle for surface-mode lasers and sensors.
physics.optics:An array of pairs of parallel gold nanorods is shown to have a negative refractive index n'=-0.3 at the optical communication wavelength of 1.5 micron. This effect results from the plasmon resonance in the pairs of nanorods for both the electric and magnetic components of light. The refractive index is retrieved from the direct phase and amplitude measurements for transmission and reflection, which are all in excellent agreement with our finite difference time domain simulations. The refraction critically depends on the phase of the transmitted wave, which emphasizes the importance of phase measurements in finding n'.
physics.optics:Coupling of external light signals into a photonic crystal waveguide becomes increasingly inefficient as the group velocity of the waveguiding mode slows down. We have systematically studied the efficiency of coupling in the slow light regime for samples with different truncations of the photonic lattice at the coupling interface. Inverse power law dependence is found to best fit the experimental scaling of the coupling loss on the group index. Coupling efficiency is found to be significantly improved up to group indices of 100 for a truncation of the lattice that favors the appearance of the photonic surface states at the coupling interface in resonance with the slow light mode.
physics.optics:We report on the first observation of hole whispering gallery lasers from semiconductor microcavities with three dimensional optical confinement, with thresholds potentially reducible to micro-to-nano ampere regimes according to a quadratic size-dependent reduction, due to ideal quantum wire properties of the naturally formed photonic quantum rings before imminent recombination in a dynamic steady state fashion. If the device size grows over a critical diameter, the quantum ring whispering gallery then begins to disappear. However, cooperative small hole arrays like 256x256 quantum ring emitters avoid the criticality and open a possibility of constructing practical dense electro-pumped micro-to-nano watt emitter arrays, amenable to mega-to-giga ring emitter chip development via present fabrication techniques.
physics.optics:We report on systematic experimental mapping of the transmission properties of two-dimensional silicon-on-insulator photonic crystal waveguides for a broad range of hole radii, slab thicknesses and waveguide lengths for both TE and TM polarizations. Detailed analysis of numerous spectral features allows a direct comparison of experimental data with 3D plane wave and finite-difference time-domain calculations. We find, counter-intuitively, that the bandwidth for low-loss propagation completely vanishes for structural parameters where the photonic band gap is maximized. Our results demonstrate that, in order to maximize the bandwidth of low-loss waveguiding, the hole radius must be significantly reduced. While the photonic band gap considerably narrows, the bandwidth of low-loss propagation in PhC waveguides is increased up to 125nm with losses as low as 8$\pm$2dB/cm.
physics.optics:Much experimental evidence of superluminal phenomena has been available by electromagnetic wave propagation experiments, with the results showing that the phase time do describe the barrier traversal time. Based on the extrapolated phase time approach and numerical methods, we show that, in contrary to the ordinary Bessel waves of real argument, the group velocities of modified Bessel waves are superluminal, and obtain the following results: 1) the group velocities increase with the increase of propagation distance, which is similar to the evanescent plane-wave cases; 2) for large wave numbers, the group velocities fall off as the wave numbers increase, which is similar to the evanescent plane-wave cases; 3) for small wave numbers, the group velocities increase with the increase of wave numbers, this is different from the evanescent plane-wave cases.
physics.optics:Peculiar light-matter interactions can break the rule that a single beam polarization can address only two states in an optical memory device. Multistate storage of a single beam polarization is achieved using self-induced surface diffraction gratings in a photo-active polymer material. The grating orientation follows the incident light beam polarization direction. The permanent self-induced surface relief grating can be readout in real time using the same laser beam.
physics.optics:We report a nanofabricated medium made of electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold dots with geometry carefully designed at a 10-nm level. The medium exhibits strong magnetic response at visible-light frequencies, including bands with negative \mu. The magnetism arises due to the excitation of quadrupole plasmon resonances. Our approach shows for the first time the feasibility of magnetism at optical frequencies and paves a way towards magnetic and left-handed components for visible optics.
physics.optics:Metal-based negative refractive index materials have been extensively studied in the microwave region. However, negative-index metamaterials have not been realized at near-IR or visible fre-quencies due to difficulties of fabrication and to the generally poorer optical properties of metals at these wavelengths. In this paper, we report the first fabrication and experimental verification of a transversely structured metal-dielectric-metal multilayer exhibiting a negative refractive in-dex around 2 mm. Both the amplitude and the phase of the transmission and reflection were measured experimentally, and are in good agreement with a rigorous coupled wave analysis.
physics.optics:We report on a strategy for achieving negative phase velocity (NPV) in a homogenized composite medium (HCM) conceptualized using the Bruggeman formalism. The constituent material phases of the HCM do not support NPV propagation. The HCM and its constituent phases are isotropic dielectric-magnetic mediums; the real parts of their permittivities/permeabilities are negative-valued whereas the real parts of their permeabilities/permittivities are positive-valued.
physics.optics:Photonic crystal fibers are used in fiber amplifiers and lasers because of the flexibility in the design of mode area and dispersion. However, these quantities depend strongly on the wavelength. The wavelength dependence of gain, nonlinearity and dispersion are investigated here by including the wavelength dependence explicitly in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for photonic crystal fibers with varying periods and hole sizes. The effect of the wavelength dependence of each parameter is studied separately as well as combined. The wavelength dependence of the parameters is shown to create asymmetry to the spectrum and chirp, but to have a moderating effect on pulse broadening. The effect of including the wavelength dependence of nonlinearity in the simulations is demonstrated to be the most significant compared that of dispersion or gain.
physics.optics:The report deals with classical and quantum descriptions of particles that interact with smooth random potentials, for example ultracold atoms in the dipole potential of an optical speckle pattern. In addition, a discussion of the link between Radiative Transfer theory and the underlying coherence theory of wave optics is presented. The Radiative Transfer Equation is shown to emerge as a limiting case of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation, and some next-order corrections are discussed.
physics.optics:Observation of coherent population trapping (CPT) at ground-state Zeeman sublevels of $Cr^{3+}$-ion in ruby is reported. The experiments are performed at room temperature by using both nanosecond optical pulses and nanosecond trains of ultrashort pulses. In both cases sharp drops in the resonantly induced fluorescence are detected as the external magnetic field is varied. Theoretical analysis of CPT in a transient regime due to pulsed action of optical pulses is presented.
physics.optics:Nanostructured metal surfaces comprised of periodically arranged spherical voids are grown by electrochemical deposition through a self-assembled template. Detailed measurements of the angle- and orientation-dependent reflectivity reveal the spectral dispersion, from which we identify the presence of both delocalized Bragg- and localized Mie-plasmons. These couple strongly producing bonding and anti-bonding mixed plasmons with anomalous dispersion properties. Appropriate plasmon engineering of the void morphology selects the plasmon spatial and spectral positions, allowing these plasmonic crystal films to be optimised for a wide range of sensing applications.
physics.optics:We study the free-propagation features of an optical field endowed with a non-uniform polarization pattern with elliptical symmetry. The fields derived in this way are called Elliptically Symmetric Polarized Beams (ESPB for short). Some properties of these fields are analysed. Moreover, it is shown how it is possible to obtain such light beams by applying the results to Bessel-Gauss beams.
physics.optics:The treatment found on most general optics textbooks related to the phase contrast technique imposes limitations on the filter phase and object phase variations in order to mathematically explain it in a simple manner. We consider that this simplified treatment can be misleading in terms of the concept the student may develop and also about the potential applications of the phase contrast technique. In this paper we describe a broader and yet simple explanation of the phase contrast process, creating a parallelism between optical image processing and interferometry.
physics.optics:We demonstrate single-mode lasing at telecommunication wavelengths from a circular nanocavity employing a radial Bragg reflector. Ultra-small modal volume and Sub milliwatt pump threshold level are observed for lasers with InGaAsP quantum well active membrane. The electromagnetic field is shown to be tightly confined within the 300nm central pillar of the cavity. The quality factors of the resonator modal fields are estimated to be on the order of a few thousands.
physics.optics:Optical levitation of a liquid droplet in gas phase was investigated under timedependent change of the gravitational acceleration with specific flight pattern of an airplane. Through multiple trials under linear increase of effective gravitational acceleration, we performed the experiment of ptical trapping of a droplet from 0.3g_0 to 0.9g_0, where g_0 = 9.8 m/s^2. During such change of the effective gravitational acceleration, the trapping position on a droplet with the radius of 14 &#956;m was found to be lowered by ca. 100 &#956;m. The essential feature of the change of the trapping position is reproduced by a theoretical calculation under the framework of ray optics. As far as we know, the present study is the first report on optical levitation under time-dependent gravitational change.
physics.optics:We calculate the static dielectric tensor of a periodic system of aligned anisotropic dielectric cylinders. Exact analytical formulas for the effective dielectric constants for the E- and H- eigenmodes are obtained for arbitrary 2D Bravais lattice and arbitrary cross-section of anisotropic cylinders. It is shown that depending on the symmetry of the unit cell photonic crystal of anisotropic cylinders behaves in the low-frequency limit like uniaxial or biaxial natural crystal. The developed theory of homogenization of anisotropic cylinders is applied for calculations of the dielectric properties of photonic crystals of carbon nanotubes.
physics.optics:Scattering processes in an optical microcavity are investigated for the case of silicon nanocrystals embedded in an ultra-high Q toroid microcavity. Using a novel measurement technique based on the observable mode-splitting, we demonstrate that light scattering is highly preferential: more than 99.8% of the scattered photon flux is scattered into the original doubly-degenerate cavity modes. The large capture efficiency is attributed to an increased scattering rate into the cavity mode, due to the enhancement of the optical density of states over the free space value and has the same origin as the Purcell effect in spontaneous emission. The experimentally determined Purcell factor amounts to 883.
physics.optics:The six-fold rotational symmetry of photonic crystal fibers has important manifestations in the radiated fields in terms of i) a focusing phenomena at a finite distance from the end-facet and ii) the formation of low-intensity satellite peaks in the asymptotic far field. For our study, we employ a surface equivalence principle which allows us to rigorously calculate radiated fields starting from fully-vectorial simulations of the near field. Our simulations show that the focusing is maximal at a characteristic distance from the end-facet. For large-mode area fibers the typical distance is of the order 10 Lambda with Lambda being the pitch of the triangular air-hole lattice of the photonic crystal fiber.
physics.optics:Time Shaping of ultrashort visible pulses has been performed using a specially designed Acousto-Optic Programmable Dispersive Filter of 50% efficiency at the output of a two-stage noncollinear optical parametric amplifier. The set-up is compact and reliable. It provides a tunable shaped source in the visible with unique features: 4 ps shaping window with preserved tunability over 500-650 nm, and pulses as short as 30 fs. Several $\mu$J output energy is easily obtained.
physics.optics:We investigate propagation of light pulses in photonic crystals in the vicinity of the zero-diffraction point. We show that Gaussian pulses due to nonzero width of their spectrum spread weakly in space and time during the propagation. We also find the family of nonspreading pulses, propagating invariantly in the vicinity of the zero diffraction point of photonic crystals.
physics.optics:We measured the overall motion of Brownian particles suspended in water by a self-mixing thin-slice solid-state laser with extreme optical sensitivity. From the demodulated signal of laser intensity fluctuations through self-mixing modulations by the interference between the lasing field and Doppler-shifted scattered fields from Brownian particles, it was found that the changes over time in random walks of small particles suspended in water result in different overall dynamics when the field of vision for particles seen by the laser beam (scale of the observation) is changed. At a small focal volume of the laser beam, in which the relevant diffusion broadening is observed, the overall motion which can be represented by the motion of a ''virtual'' single particle whose velocity obeys a double-peaked non-Gaussian distribution function. The fast motion of a virtual particle, featuring fractional Brownian motion, which leads to a pure random walk with increasing the observation time, has been characterized in terms of mean-square displacements of a virtual particle.
physics.optics:Ordinary metallic photonic crystals (PCs) have photonic band gaps in which the density of states (DOS) is strongly modified. Thermal emission of photons can be suppressed and enhanced accordingly. We consider the thermal emission characteristics of a metallic photonic crystal slab with a tunable thickness which in the thick limit approaches that of a photonic crystal and in the thin limit approaches that of a textured surface. We find that a thick photonic crystal suppresses emission in a specific range while a thin slab suppresses low frequency emission.
physics.optics:For emitters in a medium, different macroscopic or microscopic theoretical models predict substantially different dependencies of the spontaneous emission lifetime on refractive index. Various measurements have been carried out on Eu$^{3+}$, Ce$^{3+}$ and Nd$^{3+}$ ions, and quantum dots in different surrounding medial. The dependence of the spontaneous emission rates on refractive index has been interpreted with different models. By closely examining some of the experimental results, we notice that some interpretations are based on implicit assumptions which are hard to justify, and some measurements contain too big uncertainties to discriminate among different models. In this work we reanalyse the avilable measured results and give a consistent interpretation.
physics.optics:The oblique incidence of a Bessel beam on a dielectric slab with refractive index n1 surrounded by a medium of a refractive index n>n1 may be studied simply by expanding the Bessel beam into a set of plane waves forming the same angle with the axis of the beam. In the present paper we examine a Bessel beam that impinges at oblique incidence onto a layer in such a way that each plane-wave component impinges with an angle larger than the critical angle.
physics.optics:Photoemission electron microscopy was used to image the electrons photoemitted from specially tailored Ag nanoparticles deposited on a Si substrate (with its native oxide SiO$_{x}$). Photoemission was induced by illumination with a Hg UV-lamp (photon energy cutoff $\hbar\omega_{UV}=5.0$ eV, wavelength $\lambda_{UV}=250$ nm) and with a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser ($\hbar\omega_{l}=3.1$ eV, $\lambda_{l}=400$ nm, pulse width below 200 fs), respectively. While homogeneous photoelectron emission from the metal is observed upon illumination at energies above the silver plasmon frequency, at lower photon energies the emission is localized at tips of the structure. This is interpreted as a signature of the local electrical field therefore providing a tool to map the optical near field with the resolution of emission electron microscopy.
physics.optics:In this Comment I argue that the method of images used by Huang, Yu, Gu and co-authors [Phys Rev. E, 65, 21401 (2002); Phys Rev. E., 69, 51402 (2004)] to calculate electromagnetic properties of interacting spheres at finite frequencies is inapplicable and does not provide a physically meaningful approximation.
physics.optics:Origin and properties of non-Lorentzian spectral lines in linear chains of nanospheres are discussed. The lines are shown to be super-exponentially narrow with the characteristic width proportional to exp[-C(h/a)^3] where C is a numerical constant, h the spacing between the nanospheres in the chain and a the sphere radius. The fine structure of these spectral lines is also investigated.
physics.optics:Optical microcavities based on zero-group-velocity surface modes in photonic crystal slabs are studied. It is shown that high quality factors can be easily obtained for such microcavities in photonic crystal slabs. With increasing of the cavity length, the quality factor is gradually enhanced and the resonant frequency converges to that of the zero-group-velocity surface mode in the photonic crystal. The number of the resonant modes with high quality factors is mainly determined by the number of surface modes with zero-group velocity.
physics.optics:The backward scattering of TM-polarized light by a two-side-open subwavelength slit in a metal film is analyzed. We show that the reflection coefficient versus wavelength possesses a Fabry-Perot-like dependence that is similar to the anomalous behavior of transmission reported in the study [Y. Takakura, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{86}, 5601 (2001)]. The open slit totally reflects the light at the near-to-resonance wavelengths. In addition, we show that the interference of incident and resonantly backward-scattered light produces in the near-field diffraction zone a spatially localized wave whose intensity is 10-10$^3$ times greater than the incident wave, but one order of magnitude smaller than the intra-cavity intensity. The amplitude and phase of the resonant wave at the slit entrance and exit are different from that of a Fabry-Perot cavity.
physics.optics:The supercell method is used to study the variation of the photonic bandgaps in one-dimensional photonic crystals under random perturbations to thicknesses of the layers. The results of both plane wave and analytical band structure and density of states calculations are presented along with the transmission cofficient as the level of randomness and the supercell size is increased. It is found that higher bandgaps disappear first as the randomness is gradually increased. The lowest bandgap is found to persist up to a randomness level of 55 percent.
physics.optics:We study the effect of rotation on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in slow-light waveguide structures consisting of coupled micro-ring resonators. We show that such configurations exhibit new a type of the Sagnac effect which can be used for the realization of highly-compact integrated rotation sensors and gyroscopes.
physics.optics:The dispersion relations for conventional uniaxial dielectric mediums may be characterized as elliptical or elliptical-like, according to whether the medium is nondissipative or dissipative, respectively. However, under certain constitutive parameter regimes, the dispersion relations may be hyperbolic or hyperbolic-like. We investigate planewave propagation in a hyperbolic/hyperbolic-like uniaxial dielectric medium. For both evanescent and nonevanescent propagation, the phase velocity is found to be positive with respect to the time-averaged Poynting vector. A conceptualization of a hyperbolic--like uniaxial medium as a homogenized composite medium is presented.
physics.optics:We show how to synthesize a CW, single-frequency optical field from the frequency-dispersed, pulsed field of a mode-locked laser. This process, which relies on difference frequency generation in an optical cavity, is efficient and can be considered as an optical rectification. Quantitative estimates for the output power and amplitude noise properties of a realistic system are given. Possible applications to optical frequency synthesis and optical metrology are envisaged.
physics.optics:We study nonlinear coupling of mutually incoherent beams associated with different Floquet-Bloch waves in a one-dimensional optically-induced photonic lattice. We demonstrate experimentally how such interactions lead to asymmetric mutual focusing and, for waves with opposite diffraction properties, to simultaneous focusing and defocusing as well as discreteness-induced beam localization and reshaping effects.
physics.optics:We study the second-harmonic generation in left-handed metamaterials with a quadratic nonlinear response. We demonstrate a novel type of the exact phase matching between the backward propagating wave of the fundamental frequency and the forward propagating wave of the second harmonics. We show that this novel parametric process can convert a surface of the left-handed metamaterial into an effective mirror totally reflecting the second harmonics generated by an incident wave. We derive and analyze theoretically the coupled-mode equations for a semi-infinite nonlinear metamaterial. We also study numerically the second-harmonic generation by a metamaterial slab of a finite thickness, and reveal the existence of multistable nonlinear effects.
physics.optics:Expressions corresponding to the transmission of a uniaxial optically active crystal platelet are provided for an optical axis parallel and perpendicular to the plane of interface. The optical activity is taken into account by a consistent multipolar expansion of the crystal medium response due to the path of an electromagnetic wave. Numerical examples of the effect of the optical activity are given for quartz platelets of chosen thicknesses. The optical activity's effects on the variations of the transmission of quartz platelets as a function of the angle of incidence is also investigated.
physics.optics:We use a phenomenological Hamiltonian approach to derive a set of coupled mode equations that describe light propagation in waveguides that are periodically side-coupled to microcavities. The structure exhibits both Bragg gap and (polariton like) resonator gap in the dispersion relation. The origin and physical significance of the two types of gaps are discussed. The coupled-mode equations derived from the effective field formalism are valid deep within the Bragg gaps and resonator gaps.
physics.optics:We reconsider the basic properties of ray-transfer matrices for first-order optical systems from a geometrical viewpoint. In the paraxial regime of scalar wave optics, there is a wide family of beams for which the action of a ray-transfer matrix can be fully represented as a bilinear transformation on the upper complex half-plane, which is the hyperbolic plane. Alternatively, this action can be also viewed in the unit disc. In both cases, we use a simple trace criterion that arranges all first-order systems in three classes with a clear geometrical meaning: they represent rotations, translations, or parallel displacements. We analyze in detail the relevant example of an optical resonator.
physics.optics:Using a two-dipole model of an optical near-field of Scanning Near-field Optical Microscope tip, i. e. taking into account contributions of magnetic and electric dipoles, we propose and analyze a new type of 3D optical nanotrap found for certain relations between electric and magnetic dipoles. Electric field attains a minimum value in vacuum in the vicinity of the tip and hence such a trap is quite suitable for manipulations with cold atoms.
physics.optics:The propagation of a Bessel beam (or Bessel-X wave) is analyzed on the basis of a vectorial treatment. The electric and magnetic fields are obtained by considering a realistic situation able to generate that kind of scalar field. Specifically, we analyze the field due to a ring-shaped aperture over a metallic screen on which a linearly polarized plane wave impinges. On this basis, and in the far field approximation, we can obtain information about the propagation of energy flux and the velocity of the energy.
physics.optics:Under certain circumstances, the group velocity in a homogenized composite medium (HCM) can exceed the group velocity in its component material phases. We explore this phenomenon for a uniaxial dielectric HCM comprising isotropic component material phases distributed as oriented spheroidal particles. The theoretical approach is based upon the Bruggeman homogenization formalism. Enhancement in group velocity in the HCM with respect to the component material phases is shown to be sensitively dependent upon the shape of the component spheroids and their alignment relative to the direction of propagation.
physics.optics:It is shown that the copropagating three-wave-mixing parametric process, with appropriate type-II extended phase matching and pumped with a short second-harmonic pulse, can perform spectral phase conjugation and parametric amplification, which shows a threshold behavior analogous to backward wave oscillation. The process is also analyzed in the Heisenberg picture, which predicts a spontaneous parametric down conversion rate in agreement with the experimental result reported by Kuzucu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 083601 (2005)]. Applications in optical communications, signal processing, and quantum information processing can be envisaged.
physics.optics:Radiation loss and resonant frequency shift due to sidewall surface roughness of circular and square high-contrast microcavities are estimated and compared by using a boundary integral equations method. An effect of various harmonic components of the contour perturbation on the Whispering-Gallery (WG) modes in the circular microdisk and WG-like modes in the square microcavity is demonstrated. In both cases, contour deformations that are matched to the mode field pattern cause the most significant frequency detuning and Q-factor change. Favorably mode-matched deformations have been found, enabling one to manipulate the Q-factors of the microcavity modes.
physics.optics:A diffractive arrangement that allows imaging of an object without any intermediate or complementary element is presented. This optical system with only two diffraction gratings forms color images with white light.
physics.optics:Linear defect modes in one-dimensional photonic lattices are studied theoretically. For negative (repulsive) defects, various localized defect modes are found. The strongest confinement of the defect modes appear when the lattice intensity at the defect site is {\em non-zero} rather than zero. When launched at small angles into such a defect site of the lattice, a Gaussian beam can be trapped and undergo snake oscillations under appropriate conditions.
physics.optics:We report on phenomenon of Anderson-type localization of walking solitons in optical lattices with random frequency modulation, manifested as dramatic enhancement of soliton trapping probability on lattice inhomogeneities with growth of the frequency fluctuation level. The localization process is strongly sensitive to the lattice depth since in shallow lattices walking solitons experience random refraction and/or multiple scattering in contrast to relatively deep lattices, where solitons are typically immobilized in the vicinity of local minimums on modulation frequency.
physics.optics:We consider Fabry-Perot cavity resonance in periodic stacks of anisotropic layers with misaligned in-plane anisotropy at the frequency close to a photonic band edge. We show that in-plane dielectric anisotropy can result in a dramatic increase in field intensity and group delay associated with the transmission resonance. The field enhancement appears to be proportional to forth degree of the number N of layers in the stack. By contrast, in common periodic stacks of isotropic layers, those effects are much weaker and proportional to N^2. Thus, the anisotropy allows to drastically reduce the size of the resonance cavity with similar performance. The key characteristic of the periodic arrays with the gigantic transmission resonance is that the dispersion curve omega(k)at the photonic band edge has the degenerate form Delta(omega) ~ Delta(k)^4, rather than the regular form Delta(omega) ~ Delta(k)^2. This can be realized in specially arranged stacks of misaligned anisotropic layers. The degenerate band edge cavity resonance with similar outstanding properties can also be realized in a waveguide environment, as well as in a linear array of coupled multimode resonators, provided that certain symmetry conditions are in place.
physics.optics:Propagation and tunneling of light through photonic barriers formed by thin dielectric films with continuous curvilinear distributions of dielectric susceptibility across the film, are considered. Giant heterogeneity-induced dispersion of these films, both convex and concave, and its influence on their reflectivity and transmittivity are visualized by means of exact analytical solutions of Maxwell equations. Depending on the cut-off frequency of the film, governed by the spatial profile of its refractive index, propagation or tunneling of light through such barriers are examined. Subject to the shape of refractive index profile the group velocities of EM waves in these films are shown to be either increased or deccreased as compared with the homogeneous layers; however, these velocities for both propagation and tunneling regimes remain subluminal. The decisive influence of gradient and curvature of photonic barriers on the efficiency of tunneling is examined by means of generalized Fresnel formulae. Saturation of the phase of the wave tunneling through a stack of such films (Hartman effect), is demonstrated. The evanescent modes in lossy barriers and violation of Hartman effect in this case is discussed.
physics.optics:The theoretical work of V.B. Braginsky predicted that radiation pressure can couple the mechanical, mirror-eigenmodes of a Fabry-Perot resonator to it's optical modes, leading to a parametric oscillation instability. This regime is characterized by regenerative mechanical oscillation of the mechanical mirror eigenmodes. We have recently observed the excitation of mechanical modes in an ultra-high-Q optical microcavity. Here, we present a detailed experimental analysis of this effect and demonstrate that radiation pressure is the excitation mechanism of the observed mechanical oscillations.
physics.optics:We propose and analyze a new type of a resonant high-Q cavity for lasing, sensing or filtering applications, which is based on a surface states of a finite photonic crystal. We demonstrate that such the cavity can have a Q factor comparable with that one of conventional photonic band-gap defect mode cavities. At the same time, the distinguished feature of the surface mode cavity is that it is situated directly at the surface of the photonic crystal. This might open up new possibilities for design of novel photonic devices and integration of photonic circuits.
physics.optics:Resonant electromagnetic modes are analyzed inside a dielectric cavity of equilateral triangular cross section and refractive index n, surrounded by a uniform medium of refractive index n'. The field confinement is determined only under the requirements needed to maintain total internal reflection of the internal electromagnetic fields, matched to exponentially decaying evanescent waves outside the cavity. Two-dimensional electromagnetics is considered, with no dependence on the coordinate perpendicular to the cross section; hence, independent transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations are described separately. A linear combination of six plane waves is sufficient within the cavity, whose wavevectors are related by 120-degree rotations and whose phases are related by Fresnel reflection coefficients. Generally, the mode spectrum becomes sparse and the minimum mode frequency increases rapidly as the index ratio N=n/n' approaches 2. For specified quantum numbers and N, the TM modes are lower in frequency than the TE modes. Assuming the evanescent boundary waves escape at the triangle vertices, TE modes generally are found to have greater confinement of the fields inside the cavity and much higher quality factors than TM modes.
physics.optics:We study the optical properties of metamaterials made from cut-wire pairs or plate pairs. We obtain a more pronounced optical response for arrays of plate pairs -- a geometry which also eliminates the undesired polarization anisotropy of the cut-wire pairs. The measured optical spectra agree with simulations, revealing negative magnetic permeability in the range of telecommunications wavelengths. Thus, nanoscopic plate pairs might serve as an alternative to the established split-ring resonator design.
physics.optics:The four-wave mixing produced with two ultrashort phase-locked w-3w laser pulses propagating coherently in a two-level system in the infrared spectral region is shown to depend on the pulses relative phase. The Maxwell-Bloch equations are solved beyond the rotating-wave approximation to account for field frequencies which are largely detuned from the atomic resonance. The relative phase dominating the efficiency of the coupling to the 5w anti-Stokes Raman component is determined by sign of the total ac Stark shift induced in the system, in such a way that the phase influence disappears precisely where the ac Stark effect due to both pulses is compensated. This fundamental quantum interference effect can be the basis for nonlinear ultrafast optical spectroscopy techniques.
physics.optics:We study the beaming effect of light for the case of increased-index photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides, formed through the omission of low-dielectric media in the waveguide region. We employ the finite-difference time-domain numerical method for characterizing the beaming effect and determining the mechanisms of loss and the overall efficiency of the directional emission. We find that, while this type of PhC waveguides is capable of producing a highly collimated emission as was demonstrated experimentally, the inherent characteristics of the structure result in a restrictively low efficiency in the coupling of light into the collimated beam of light.
physics.optics:The existence of phase resonances in obliquely illuminated, perfectly conducting compound gratings is investigated. The diffraction problem of a p-polarized plane wave impinging on the structure is solved using the modal approach. The results show that even under oblique illumination, where no symmetry is imposed by the incident field, there are resonant wavelengths that are clearly associated with a certain degree of symmetry in the phase distribution of the magnetic field inside the cavities. New configurations of this phase distribution take place, that were not allowed under normal incidence conditions. It was found that the interior field is intensified in the resonances, and the specularly reflected efficiency is maximized. In particular, this efficiency is optimized for Littrow mount.
physics.optics:We report the measurement of the r23 and r33 electro-optic coefficients and of the z-axis electrical conductivity of the nonlinear optical crystals Na:KTP and RTA. We observed a marked decrease of the electro-optic effect in the Na:KTP crystals for frequencies below 100 Hz. This effect is absent in RTA.
physics.optics:Under certain conditions, a transparent photonic band can be designed into a one-dimensional metallodielectric nanofilm structure. Unlike conventional pass bands in photonic crystals, where the finite thickness of the structure affects the transmission of electromagnetic fields having frequency within the pass band, the properties of the transparent band are almost unaffected by the finite thickness of the structure. In other words, an incident field at a frequency within the transparent band exhibits 100% transmission independent of the number of periods of the structure. The transparent photonic band corresponds to excitation of pure eigenstate modes across the entire Bloch band in structures possessing mirror symmetry. The conditions to create these modes and thereby to lead to a totally transparent band phenomenon are discussed.
physics.optics:We study the higher order harmonics of scalar modulational instability in the regime where it arises spontaneously through amplification of vacuum fluctuations. We obtain detailed predictions concerning the detunings, intensities, growth rates and spectral widths of the harmonics. These predictions are well verified by experimental results obtained by propagating high intensity light pulses through optical fibers.
physics.optics:We have shown within the quasistatic approximation that the giant fluctuations of local electromagnetic field in random fractal aggregates of silver nanospheres are strongly correlated with a local anisotropy factor S which is defined in this paper. The latter is a purely geometrical parameter which characterizes the deviation of local environment of a given nanosphere in an aggregate from spherical symmetry. Therefore, it is possible to predict the sites with anomalously large local fields in an aggregate without explicitly solving the electromagnetic problem. We have also demonstrated that the average (over nanospheres) value of S does not depend noticeably on the fractal dimension D, except when D approaches the trivial limit D=3. In this case, as one can expect, the average local environment becomes spherically symmetrical and S approaches zero. This corresponds to the well-known fact that in trivial aggregates fluctuations of local electromagnetic fields are much weaker than in fractal aggregates. Thus, we find that, within the quasistatics, the large-scale geometry does not have a significant impact on local electromagnetic responses in nanoaggregates in a wide range of fractal dimensions. However, this prediction is expected to be not correct in aggregates which are sufficiently large for the intermediate- and radiation-zone interaction of individual nanospheres to become important.
physics.optics:A possibility of tuning the phase of the third-order Kerr-type nonlinear susceptibility in a system consisting of two interacting metal nanospheres and a nonlinearly polarizable molecule is investigated theoretically and numerically. It is shown that by varying the relative inter-sphere separation, it is possible to tune the phase of the effective nonlinear susceptibility \chi^{(3)}(\omega;\omega,\omega,-\omega)$ in the whole range from 0 to $2\pi$.
physics.optics:We present an optical interference model to create chiral microstructures (spirals) and its realization in photoresist using holographic lithography. The model is based on the interference of six equally-spaced circumpolar linear polarized side beams and a circular polarized central beam. The pitch and separation of the spirals can be varied by changing the angle between the side beams and the central beam. The realization of the model is carried out using the 325 nm line of a He-Cd laser and spirals of sub-micron size are fabricated in photoresist.
physics.optics:We studied the optical properties of a dielectric photonic crystal structure with spirals arranged in a hexagonal lattice. The dielectric constant of the material is 9 and the filling ratio is 15.2%. We found that this kind of structure exhibits a significant polarization gap for light incident along the axis of the spirals. The eigenmodes inside the polarization gap are right-hand (left-hand) circularly polarized depending on the whether the spirals are left-handed (right-handed). The transmission spectrum of a slab of such a structure has been calculated and matches well with the analysis of the eigenmodes.
physics.optics:The evanescent coupling from a photonic crystal resonator to a micron-thick optical fiber is investigated in detail by using a 3D-FDTD method. Properly designed photonic crystal cavity and taper structures are proposed, and optimal operating conditions are found to enhance the coupling strength while suppressing other cavity losses including the coupling to the slab propagating mode and to the higher-order fiber mode. In simulation, the coupling into the fundamental fiber mode is discriminated from other cavity losses by spatial and parity filtering of the FDTD results. The coupling efficiency of more than 80% into the fundamental fiber mode together with a total Q factor of 5,200 is achieved for the fiber diameter of 1.0 um and the air gap of 200 nm between the fiber and the cavity.
physics.optics:The backscattering of circularly polarized light at normal incidence to a half-space of scattering particles is studied using the Electric Field Monte Carlo (EMC) method. The spatial distribution of the backscattered light intensity is examined for both the time-resolved and continuous-wave cases for large particles with anisotropy factor, g, in the range 0.8 to 0.97. For the time-resolved case, the backscattered light with the same helicity as that of the incident beam (co-polarized) is found to form a ring centered on the point of incidence. The ring expands and simultaneously grows weak as time increases. The intensity of backscattered light with helicity opposite to that of the incident beam (cross-polarized) is found to exhibit a ring behavior for g>=0.85, with significant backscattering at the point of incidence. For the continuous-wave case no such ring pattern is observed in backscattered light for either helicity. The present EMC study suggests that the ring behavior can only be observed in the time domain, in contrast to previous studies of light backscattered from forward scattering media based on the scalar time-independent Fokker-Planck approximation to the radiative transfer equation. The time-dependent ring structure of backscattered light may have potential use in subsurface imaging applications.
physics.optics:Three dimensional images having continuous horizontal parallax were developed by wavelength enconding of view followed by a natural decoding process of projection onto a diffractive screen. It allows for the direct criation of "holoimages" by using projected images of a real object substituting holographic images for some applications in the visual aarts. It also allows for the enlargement of holograms performing simultaneously its conversion to the white light observation. White light is employed in this process, since laser light is only necessary for constructing the diffractive components.
physics.optics:This article recounts definition, classification, history, and applications of microstructured optical fibers.
physics.optics:The temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals deposited inside the ultraviolet (UV) opal were studied. ZnO was grown in the voids between FCC packed silicon dioxide spheres using spray pyrolysis under ultrasonic vibration in the solution containing a zinc nitrate precursor. The ZnO nanoparticles inside opal matrix with UV photonic band-gap exhibit suppression of the excitonic emission and enhancement of the deep level emission. Suppression of the excitonic lines is due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission, while enhancement and broadening of the DL emission in the green spectral region is due to Purcell effect. The infiltration of ZnO inside the photonic crystal may be a useful technique to increase its emission efficiency in the selected spectral region.
physics.optics:A novel, 3-dimensional, convex, multi-pass optical cavity with partially-chaotic ray dynamics is presented. The light is localized near stable, long-path length trajectories supported by the cavity, and beam diffraction is suppressed by the phase space barriers between the regions of regular and chaotic ray dynamics that are generally present in partially-chaotic systems. For a centimeter-size cavity, the design supports meter-scale optical path lengths, suggesting future applications in trace gas detection. An exemplary cavity has been fabricated from a hollow, gold-coated, acrylic shell. Our measurements using a HeNe laser and a pulsed red diode laser for characterization of the cavity beam pattern and optical path length, respectively, confirm the theoretically predicted optical dynamics and the ability of the cavity to support meter-scale path lengths.
physics.optics:We report on measurements of visible extinction spectra of semicontinuous silver nanoshells grown on colloidal silica spheres. We find that thin, fractal shells below the percolation threshold exhibit geometrically tunable plasmon resonances. A modified scaling theory approach is used to model the dielectric response of such shells, which is then utilized to obtain the extinction cross section in a retarded Mie scattering formalism. We show that such spherical resonators support unique plasmon dynamics: in the visible there is a new regime of coherently driven cluster-localized plasmons, while crossover to homogeneous response in the infrared predicts a delocalized shell plasmon.
physics.optics:We describe a semi-analytical approach for three-dimensional analysis of photonic crystal fibre devices. The approach relies on modal transmission-line theory. We offer two examples illustrating the utilization of this approach in photonic crystal fibres: the verification of the coupling action in a photonic crystal fibre coupler and the modal reflectivity in a photonic crystal fibre distributed Bragg reflector.
physics.optics:We demonstrate ultrafast all-optical deflection of spatial solitons in an AlGaAs slab waveguide using 190 fs, 1550 nm pulses which are used to generate and deflect the spatial soliton. The steering beam is focused onto the top of the waveguide near the soliton pathway and the soliton is steered due to refractive index changes induced by optical Kerr, or free carrier (Drude) effects. Angular deflections up to 8 mR are observed.
physics.optics:A highly unusual pattern of strong multiple resonances for bulk electromagnetic waves is predicted and analysed numerically in thick periodic holographic gratings in a slab with the mean permittivity that is larger than that of the surrounding media. This pattern is shown to exist in the geometry of grazing-angle scattering (GAS), that is when the scattered wave (+1 diffracted order) in the slab propagates almost parallel to the slab (grating) boundaries. The predicted resonances are demonstrated to be unrelated to resonant generation of the conventional guided modes of the slab. Their physical explanation is associated with resonant generation of a completely new type of eigenmodes in a thick slab with a periodic grating. These new slab eigenmodes are generically related to the grating; they do not exist if the grating amplitude is zero. The field structure of these eigenmodes and their dependence on structural and wave parameters is analysed. The results are extended to the case of GAS of guided modes in a slab with a periodic groove array of small corrugation amplitude and small variations in the mean thickness of the slab at the array boundaries.
physics.optics:Grazing-angle scattering (GAS) is a type of Bragg scattering of waves in slanted non-uniform periodic gratings, when the diffracted order satisfying the Bragg condition propagates at a grazing angle with respect to the boundaries of a slab-like grating. Rigorous analysis of GAS of bulk TE electromagnetic waves is undertaken in holographic gratings by means of the enhanced T-matrix algorithm. A comparison of the rigorous and the previously developed approximate theories of GAS is carried out. A complex pattern of numerous previously unknown resonances is discovered and analysed in detail for gratings with large amplitude, for which the approximate theory fails. These resonances are associated not only with the geometry of GAS, but are also typical for wide transmitting gratings. Their dependence on grating amplitude, angles of incidence and scattering, and grating width is investigated numerically. Physical interpretation of the predicted resonances is linked to the existence and the resonant generation of special new eigenmodes of slanted gratings. Main properties of these modes and their field structure are discussed.
physics.optics:Double-resonant extremely asymmetrical scattering (DEAS) is a strongly resonant type of Bragg scattering in two joint or separated uniform gratings with different phases. It is characterised by a very strong increase of the scattered and incident wave amplitudes inside and between the gratings at a resonant phase shift between the gratings. DEAS is realised when the first diffracted order satisfying the Bragg condition propagates parallel to the grating boundaries, and the joint or separated gratings interact by means of the diffractional divergence of the scattered waves from one grating into another. This Letter develops a theory of non-steady-state DEAS of bulk TE electromagnetic waves in holographic gratings, and investigates the process of relaxation of the incident and scattered wave amplitudes to their steady-state values inside and outside the gratings. Typical relaxation times are determined. Physical explanation of the predicted effects is presented.
physics.optics:Extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS) is a new type of Bragg scattering in thick, slanted, periodic gratings. It is realised when the scattered wave propagates parallel to the front boundary of the grating. Its most important feature is the strong resonant increase in the scattered wave amplitude compared to the amplitude of the incident wave: the smaller the grating amplitude, the larger the amplitude of the scattered wave. In this paper, rigorous numerical analysis of EAS is carried out by means of the enhanced T-matrix algorithm. This includes investigation of harmonic generation inside and outside the grating, unusually strong edge effects, fast oscillations of the incident wave amplitude in the grating, etc. Comparison with the previously developed approximate theory is carried out. In particular, it is demonstrated that the applicability conditions for the two-wave approximation in the case of EAS are noticeably more restrictive than those for the conventional Bragg scattering. At the same time, it is shown that the approximate theory is usually highly accurate in terms of description of EAS in the most interesting cases of scattering with strong resonant increase of the scattered wave amplitude. Physical explanation of the predicted effects is presented.
physics.optics:Although coherent light is usually required for the self-organization of regular spatial patterns from optical beams, we show that peculiar light matter interaction can break this evidence. In the traditional method to record laser-induced periodic surface structures, a light intensity distribution is produced at the surface of a polymer film by an interference between two coherent optical beams. We report on the self-organization followed by propagation of a surface relief pattern. It is induced in a polymer film by using a low-power and small-size coherent beam assisted by a high-power and large-size incoherent and unpolarized beam. We demonstrate that we can obtain large size and well organized patterns starting from a dissipative interaction. Our experiments open new directions to improve optical processing systems.
physics.optics:Extremely asymmetrical scattering (EAS) is an unusual type of Bragg scattering in slanted periodic gratings with the scattered wave (the +1 diffracted order) propagating parallel to the grating boundaries. Here, a unique and strong sensitivity of EAS to small stepwise variations of mean structural parameters at the grating boundaries is predicted theoretically (by means of approximate and rigorous analyses) for bulk TE electromagnetic waves and slab optical modes of arbitrary polarization in holographic (for bulk waves) and corrugation (for slab modes) gratings. The predicted effects are explained using one of the main physical reasons for EAS--the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave (similar to divergence of a laser beam). The approximate method of analysis is based on this understanding of the role of the divergence of the scattered wave, while the rigorous analysis uses the enhanced T-matrix algorithm. The effect of small and large stepwise variations of the mean permittivity at the grating boundaries is analysed. Two distinctly different and unusual patterns of EAS are predicted in the cases of wide and narrow (compared to a critical width) gratings. Comparison between the approximate and rigorous theories is carried out.
physics.optics:Low crosstalk intersections formed by two crossing coupled cavity waveguides (CCWs), which are formed by series of \textit{mono-mode} cavities in a two dimensional photonic crystal structure, are investigated. Although the individual cavities are \textit{mono-mode}, the modes of the properly designed CCWs (which are called \textit{supermodes} in this paper) may be dipole-like, and antisymmetry along the axis of the other perpendicular CCW, which ensures the low crosstalk of the intersections. According to the results of coupled mode analysis, we divide the intersections into two kinds based on the number of cavities of each CCW, and the transmission and crosstalk spectra of both kinds are numerically obtained using finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The results show that crosstalk power is lower than -30dB. We also discuss the factors that affect the performance of the intersections.
physics.optics:An extended interference pattern close to surface may result in both a transmissive or evanescent surface fields for large area manipulation of trapped particles. The affinity of differing particle sizes to a moving standing wave light pattern allows us to hold and deliver them in a bi-directional manner and importantly demonstrate experimentally particle sorting in the sub-micron region. This is performed without the need of fluid flow (static sorting). Theoretical calculations experimentally confirm that certain sizes of colloidal particles thermally hop more easily between neighboring traps. A new generic method is also presented for particle position detection in an extended periodic light pattern and applied to characterization of optical traps and particle behavior
physics.optics:We combine a tunable continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator and a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser frequency comb to provide a phase-coherent bridge between the visible and mid-infrared spectral ranges. As a first demonstration of this new technique we perform a direct frequency comparison between an iodine stabilized Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm and an infrared methane optical frequency standard at $3.39 \mu$m.
physics.optics:The reorientational nonlinearity of nematic liquid crystals enables a self-localized spatial soliton and its waveguide to be deflected or destroyed by a control beam propagating across the cell. We demonstrate a simple all-optical readdressing scheme by exploiting the lens-like perturbation induced by an external beam on both a nematicon and a co-polarized guided signal of different wavelength. Angular steering as large as 2.2 degrees was obtained for control powers as low as 32mW in the near infrared.
physics.optics:Coherent X-ray diffraction microscopy is a method of imaging non-periodic isolated objects at resolutions only limited, in principle, by the largest scattering angles recorded. We demonstrate X-ray diffraction imaging with high resolution in all three dimensions, as determined by a quantitative analysis of the reconstructed volume images. These images are retrieved from the 3D diffraction data using no a priori knowledge about the shape or composition of the object, which has never before been demonstrated on a non-periodic object. We also construct 2D images of thick objects with infinite depth of focus (without loss of transverse spatial resolution). These methods can be used to image biological and materials science samples at high resolution using X-ray undulator radiation, and establishes the techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at X-ray free-electron laser sources.
physics.optics:Forces arising from overlap between the guided waves of parallel, microphotonic waveguides are calculated. Both attractive and repulsive forces, determined by the choice of relative input phase, are found. Using realistic parameters for a silicon-on-insulator material system, we estimate that the forces are large enough to cause observable displacements. Our results illustrate the potential for a broader class of optically-tunable microphotonic devices and microstructured artificial materials.
physics.optics:There exists a class of realizable, active media for which the refractive index cannot be defined as an analytic function in the upper half-plane of complex frequency. The conventional definition of the refractive index based on analyticity is modified such that it is valid for active media in general, and associated Fresnel equations are proved. In certain active media, the presence of a ``backward'' wave, for which both phase velocity and Poynting's vector point towards the excitation source, is demonstrated.
physics.optics:We study the transmission properties for the waveguide bends composed by a circular photonic crystal. Two types (Y and U type) of the waveguide bends utilizing the circular photonic crystal are studied. It has been shown, compared with the conventional photonic crystal waveguide bends, transmission properties for these bends can be significantly improved. Over a 6.4% bandwidth, less than 1-dB loss/bend are observed. U bent waveguide, i.e., $180^o$ bend, can be easily realized with low loss using the circular photonic crystal.
physics.optics:We demonstrate optical trapping and manipulation of defects and transparent microspheres in nematic liquid crystals (LCs). The three-dimensional director fields and positions of the particles are visualized using the Fluorescence Confocal Polarizing Microscopy. We show that the disclinations can be manipulated by either using optically trapped colloidal particles or directly by tightly-focused laser beams. We employ this effect to measure the line tensions of disclinations.
physics.optics:Line-by-line calculations are becoming the standard procedure for carrying spectral simulations. However, it is important to insure the accuracy of such spectral simulations through the choice of adapted models for the simulation of key parameters such as line position, intensity, and shape. Moreover, it is necessary to rely on accurate spectral data to guaranty the accuracy of the simulated spectra. A discussion on the most accurate models available for such calculations is presented for diatomic and linear polyatomic discrete radiation, and possible reductions on the number of calculated lines are discussed in order to reduce memory and computational overheads. Examples of different approaches for the simulation of experimentally determined low-pressure molecular spectra are presented. The accuracy of different simulation approaches is discussed and it is verified that a careful choice of applied computational models and spectroscopic datasets yields precise approximations of the measured spectra.
physics.optics:We present the design, fabrication and preliminary experiments of two-dimensional photonic crystal cavities made in nanoporous silicon luminescent at 700-800 nm. Enhancement in photoluminescence extraction efficiency at the resonant wavelength is expected due to Purcell effect and directed radiation pattern defined by the cavity. Such cavities should also enhance nonlinearities exhibited by porous Si beyond what is observed in one-dimensional distributed Bragg reflection cavities due to their small mode volumes and modest quality factors. This design aligns itself well to integration with conventional silicon based electronics on a single chip.
physics.optics:Spatial effects of interference and interaction of light modes in the subwavelength part of the near-field optical microscopy probe have been theoretically studied. It was found that the mode interference can lead to higher spatial compression of light (lambda = 500 nm in free space) within the transverse size of 25 nm inside the probe output aperture of 100 nm in diameter. The results principally demonstrate the possibility of increasing spatial resolution of the near-field optical microscopy technique.
physics.optics:Self-consistent simulations of the ultrafast electron dynamics in thin metal films are performed. A regime of nonlinear oscillations is observed, which corresponds to ballistic electrons bouncing back and forth against the film surfaces. When an oscillatory laser field is applied to the film, the field energy is partially absorbed by the electron gas. Maximum absorption occurs when the period of the external field matches the period of the nonlinear oscillations, which, for sodium films, lies in the infrared range. Possible experimental implementations are discussed.
physics.optics:Two-dimensional (2-D) boundary integral equation analysis of a notched circular microdisk resonator is presented. Results obtained provide accurate description of optical modes, free from the staircasing and discretization errors of other numerical techniques. Splitting of the double degenerate Whispering-Gallery (WG) modes and directional light output is demonstrated. The effect of the notch depth and width on the resonance wavelengths, Q-factors, and emission patterns is studied. Further improvement of the directionality is demonstrated in an elliptical notched microdisk. Applications of the notched resonators to the design of microdisk lasers, oscillators, and biosensors are discussed.
physics.optics:Fast and highly accurate method based on the Muller contour integral equations and a trigonometric-trigonometric Galerkin discretization technique is presented for spectral design and fine-tuning of clusters of whispering-gallery (WG) mode microdisk resonators and photonic crystal (PC) defect cavities. It is shown that degeneracy and near-degeneracy of natural modes as well as modes optical confinement in coupled resonator clusters are significantly influenced by the symmetry of the structure. Photonic molecules with greatly enhanced quality factors are designed by exploiting the symmetry of the molecular geometry and tuning the inter-cavity coupling distances. Potential applications of the spectrally engineered coupled-resonator structures to low-threshold microdisk lasers, optical biosensors, and random powder lasers are discussed.
physics.optics:A theoretical approach to determine the optimal form of the near-field optical microscope probe is proposed. An analytical expression of the optimal probe form with subwavelength aperture has been obtained. The advantages of the probe with the optimal form are illustrated using numerical calculations. The conducted calculations show 10 times greater light throughput and the reception possibility of the more compactly localized light at the output probe aperture which could indicate better spatial resolution of the optical images in near-field optical technique using optimal probe.
physics.optics:The existing optical microscopes form an image by collecting photons emitted from an object. Here we report on the experimental realization of microscopy without the need for direct optical communication with the sample. To achieve this, we have scanned a single gold nanoparticle acting as a nano-antenna in the near field of a sample and have studied the modification of its intrinsic radiative properties by monitoring its plasmon spectrum.
physics.optics:Using quasiclassical approach rather precise analytical approximations for the eigenfrequencies of whispering gallery modes in convex axisymmetric bodies may be found. We use the eikonal method to analyze the limits of precision of quasiclassical approximation using as a practical example spheroidal dielectric cavity. The series obtained for the calculation of eigenfrequencies is compared with the known series for dielectric sphere and with numerical calculations. We show how geometrical interpretation allows expansion of the method on arbitrary shaped axisymmetric bodies.
physics.optics:In this paper we present a systematic study of photonic bandgap engineering using aperiodic lattices (ALs). Up to now ALs have tended to be defined by specific formulae (e.g. Fibonacci, Cantor), and theories have neglected other useful ALs along with the vast majority of non-useful (random) ALs. Here, we present a practical and efficient Fourier space-based general theory to identify all those ALs having useful band properties, which are characterized by well-defined Fourier (i.e. lattice momentum) components. Direct control of field localization comes via control of the Parseval strength competition between the different Fourier components characterizing a lattice. Real-space optimization of ALs tends to be computationally demanding. However, via our Fourier space-based simulated annealing inverse optimization algorithm, we efficiently tailor the relative strength of the AL Fourier components for precise control of photonic band and localization properties.
physics.optics:Quantum optical techniques may yield immersion fluids with high indices of refraction without absorption. We describe one such technique in which a probe field experiences a large index of refraction with amplification rather than absorption, and examine its practicality for an immersion lithography application. Enhanced index can be observed in a three-level system with a tunable, near-resonant, coherent probe and incoherent pump field that inverts population of the probe transition. This observation contradicts the common belief that large indices of refraction are impossible without absorption, however it is well in accord with existing electromagnetic theory and practice. Calculations show that a refractive index >> 2 is possible with practical experimental parameters. A scheme with an incoherent mixture of pumped and unpumped atoms is also examined, and is seen to have a lower refractive index (~2) accompanied by neither gain nor loss.
physics.optics:We experimentally demonstrate a prototype of a cylindrical enlarging lens capable of enhancing and restoring evanescent fields. The enabling phenomenon is the resonant excitation of coupled surface modes in a system of two cylindrical arrays of small resonant particles. As was shown in [J. Appl. Phys. 96, 1293 (2004)], this phenomenon in planar arrays can be used in electromagnetic near-field imaging. Here, we use a similar structure in a cylindrically symmetric configuration, which gives us a possibility to obtain an enlarged near-field image.
physics.optics:We have demonstrated several inexpensive methods which can be used to measure the deflection angles of prisms with microradian precision. The methods are self-referenced, using various reversals to achieve absolute measurements without the need of a reference prism or any expensive precision components other than the prisms under test. These techniques are based on laser interferometry and have been used in our lab to characterize parallel-plate beamsplitters, penta prisms, right angle prisms, and corner cube reflectors using only components typically available in an optics lab.
physics.optics:Specially designed metal-dielectric composites can have a negative refractive index in the optical range. Specifically, it is shown that arrays of single and paired nanorods can provide such negative refraction. For pairs of metal rods, a negative refractive index has been observed at 1.5 micrometer. The inverted structure of paired voids in metal films may also exhibit a negative refractive index. A similar effect can be accomplished with metal strips in which the refractive index can reach -2. The refractive index retrieval procedure and the critical role of light phases in determining the refractive index is discussed.
physics.optics:Truncated sum rules have been used to calculate the fundamental limits of the nonlinear susceptibilities; and, the results have been consistent with all measured molecules. However, given that finite-state models result in inconsistencies in the sum rules, it is not clear why the method works. In this paper, the assumptions inherent in the truncation process are discussed and arguments based on physical grounds are presented in support of using truncated sum rules in calculating fundamental limits. The clipped harmonic oscillator is used as an illustration of how the validity of truncation can be tested; and, several limiting cases are discussed as examples of the nuances inherent in the method.
physics.optics:A short note describing the development of a database providing factual and numerical data on the spectral properties of diatomic molecules. This database is available online for the overall scientific community at the following adress: http://cfp.ist.utl.pt/radiation/
physics.optics:The Fourier inversion of phased coherent diffraction patterns offers images without the resolution and depth-of-focus limitations of lens-based tomographic systems. We report on our recent experimental images inverted using recent developments in phase retrieval algorithms, and summarize efforts that led to these accomplishments. These include ab-initio reconstruction of a two-dimensional test pattern, infinite depth of focus image of a thick object, and its high-resolution (~10 nm resolution) three-dimensional image. Developments on the structural imaging of low density aerogel samples are discussed.
physics.optics:In coherent X-ray diffraction microscopy the diffraction pattern generated by a sample illuminated with coherent x-rays is recorded, and a computer algorithm recovers the unmeasured phases to synthesize an image. By avoiding the use of a lens the resolution is limited, in principle, only by the largest scattering angles recorded. However, the imaging task is shifted from the experiment to the computer, and the algorithm's ability to recover meaningful images in the presence of noise and limited prior knowledge may produce aberrations in the reconstructed image. We analyze the low order aberrations produced by our phase retrieval algorithms. We present two methods to improve the accuracy and stability of reconstructions.
physics.optics:We shortly recall the mathematical and physical aspects of Talbot's self-imaging effect occurring in near-field diffraction. In the rational paraxial approximation, the Talbot images are formed at distances z=p/q, where p and q are coprimes, and are superpositions of q equally spaced images of the original binary transmission (Ronchi) grating. This interpretation offers the possibility to express the Talbot effect through Gauss sums. Here, we pay attention to the Talbot effect in the case of dispersion in optical fibers presenting our considerations based on the close relationships of the mathematical representations of diffraction and dispersion. Although dispersion deals with continuous functions, such as gaussian and supergaussian pulses, whereas in diffraction one frequently deals with discontinuous functions, the mathematical correspondence enables one to characterize the Talbot effect in the two cases with minor differences. In addition, we apply, for the first time to our knowledge, the wavelet transform to the fractal Talbot effect in both diffraction and fiber dispersion. In the first case, the self similar character of the transverse paraxial field at irrational multiples of the Talbot distance is confirmed, whereas in the second case it is shown that the field is not self similar for supergaussian pulses. Finally, a high-precision measurement of irrational distances employing the fractal index determined with the wavelet transform is pointed out
physics.optics:We have implemented a new approach for measuring the time-dependent intensity and phase of ultrashort optical pulses. It is based on the interaction between shaped pulses and atoms, leading to coherent transients.
physics.optics:We suggest double-resonant (binary) metamaterials composed of two types of magnetic resonant elements, and demonstrate that in the nonlinear regime such metamaterials provide unique possibilities for phase-matched parametric interaction and enhanced second-harmonic generation.
physics.optics:A new kind of tridimensional scalar optical beams is introduced. These beams are called Lorentz beams because the form of their transverse pattern in the source plane is the product of two independent Lorentz functions. Closed-form expression of free-space propagation under paraxial limit is derived and pseudo non-diffracting features pointed out. Moreover, as the slowly varying part of these fields fulfils the scalar paraxial wave equation, it follows that there exist also Lorentz-Gauss beams, i.e. beams obtained by multipying the original Lorentz beam to a Gaussian apodization function. Although the existence of Lorentz-Gauss beams can be shown by using two different and independent ways obtained recently from Kiselev [Opt. Spectr. 96, 4 (2004)] and Gutierrez-Vega et al. [JOSA A 22, 289-298, (2005)], here we have followed a third different approach, which makes use of Lie's group theory, and which possesses the merit to put into evidence the symmetries present in paraxial Optics.
physics.optics:We report on the first experimental observation of photonic Bloch oscillations and Zener tunneling in two-dimensional periodic systems. We study the propagation of an optical beam in a square photonic lattice superimposed on a refractive index ramp, and demonstrate the tunneling of light from the first to the higher-order transmission bands of the lattice bandgap spectrum, associated with the spectral dynamics inside the first Brillouin zone and corresponding oscillations of the primary beam.
physics.optics:The spectral dependence of a bending loss of cascaded 60-degree bends in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides is explored in a slab-type silicon-on-insulator system. Ultra-low bending loss of (0.05+/-0.03)dB/bend is measured at wavelengths corresponding to the nearly dispersionless transmission regime. In contrast, the PhC bend is found to become completely opaque for wavelengths range corresponding to the slow light regime. A general strategy is presented and experimentally verified to optimize the bend design for improved slow light transmission.
physics.optics:Surface waves on liquids act as a dynamical phase grating for incident light. In this article, we revisit the classical method of probing such waves (wavelengths of the order of mm) as well as inherent properties of liquids and liquid films on liquids, using optical diffraction. A combination of simulation and experiment is proposed to trace out the surface wave profiles in various situations (\emph{eg.} for one or more vertical, slightly immersed, electrically driven exciters). Subsequently, the surface tension and the spatial damping coefficient (related to viscosity) of a variety of liquids are measured carefully in order to gauge the efficiency of measuring liquid properties using this optical probe. The final set of results deal with liquid films where dispersion relations, surface and interface modes, interfacial tension and related issues are investigated in some detail, both theoretically and experimentally. On the whole, our observations and analyses seem to support the claim that this simple, low--cost apparatus is capable of providing a wealth of information on liquids and liquid surface waves in a non--destructive way.
physics.optics:It is experimentally shown, that doping an organic molecular crystal reduces diffusion rate of impurity. Also reduces its influence on a modification of temperature. Examinations are lead on a crystal paradibromobenzene doping by paradiclorobenzene. Diffusing impurity was parabromochlorobenzene.
physics.optics:The precise observation of the angle-frequency spectrum of light filaments in water reveals a scenario incompatible with current models of conical emission (CE). Its description in terms of linear X-wave modes leads us to understand filamentation dynamics requiring a phase- and group-matched, Kerr-driven four-wave-mixing process that involves two highly localized pumps and two X-waves. CE and temporal splitting arise naturally as two manifestations of this process.
physics.optics:We consider a recently reported micro-fluidic dye ring laser and study the full wave nature of TE modes in the cavity by means of finite-element simulations. The resonance wave-patterns of the cavity modes support a ray-tracing view and we are also able to explain the spectrum in terms of standing waves with a mode spacing dk = 2pi/L_eff where L_eff is the effective optical path length in the cavity.
physics.optics:We introduce a small-core air-guiding photonic crystal fiber whose cladding is made of improved air-silica photonic crystal with non-circular air holes placed in triangular lattice. The fiber achieves un-disturbed bandgap guidance over 350nm wavelength range.
physics.optics:Low-dimensional ordered arrays of optical elements can possess bound modes having an extremely high quality factor. Typically, these arrays consist of metal elements which have significantly high light absorption thus restricting performance. In this paper we address the following question: can bound modes be formed in dielectric systems where the absorption of light is negligible? Our investigation of circular arrays of spherical particles shows that (1) high quality modes in an array of 10 or more particles can be attained at least for a refractive index $n_{r}>2$, so optical materials like TiO$_{2}$ or GaAs can be used; (2) the most bound modes have nearly transverse polarization perpendicular to the circular plane; (3) in a particularly interesting case of TiO$_{2}$ particles (rutile phase, $n_{r}=2.7$), the quality factor of the most bound mode increases almost by an order of magnitude with the addition of 10 extra particles, while for particles made of GaAs the quality factor increases by almost two orders of magnitude with the addition of ten extra particles. We hope that this preliminary study will stimulate experimental investigations of bound modes in low-dimensional arrays of dielectric particles.
physics.optics:We derive envelope equations which generate the Maxwell-Lorentz model and describe the interaction of optical pulses with plasmonic oscillations in metal nanoparticle composites. A family of solitary wave solutions is found which is analogous to self-induced transparency in Maxwell-Bloch. The evolution of incident optical pulses is studied numerically as are the collision dynamics of the solitary waves. These simulations reveal that the collision dynamics vary from near perfectly elastic to highly radiative depending on the relative phase of the initial pulses.
physics.optics:We propose and analyze novel surface-state-based waveguides in bandgap photonic crystals. We discuss surface mode band structure, field localization and effect of imperfections on the waveguiding properties of the surface modes. We demonstrate that surface-state-based waveguides can be used to achieve directional emission out of the waveguide. We also discuss the application of the surface-state waveguides as efficient light couplers for conventional photonic crystal waveguides.
physics.optics:We calculate the characteristics of ultraslow light in an inhomogeneously broadened medium. We present analytical and numerical results for the group delay as a function of power of the propagating pulse. We apply these results to explain the recently reported saturation behavior [Baldit {\it et al.}, \prl {\bf 95}, 143601 (2005)] of ultraslow light in rare earth ion doped crystal.
physics.optics:We have experimentally realized Brewster's effect for transverse-electric waves with metamaterials. In dielectric media, Brewster's no-reflection effect arises only for transverse-magnetic waves. However, it has been theoretically predicted that Brewster's effect arises for TE waves under the condition that the relative permeability r is not equal to unity. We have designed an array of split-ring resonators as a metamaterial with mu_r 1 using a finite-difference time-domain method. The reflection measurements were carried out in a 3-GHz region and the disappearance of reflected waves at a particular incident angle was confirmed.
physics.optics:We used two-dimensional Finte-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) software to study the transition behavior of nano-particles from scatterers to an optically uniform medium. We measured the transmission efficiency of the dipole source, which is located in the high refractive index medium(index=2.00) and encapsulated by low index resin(index=1.41). In an effort to compose index-matched resin and to reduce internal reflection, high-index nano-particles are added to low-index resin in simulations of various sizes and densities. As the size of the nano-particles and the average spacing between particles are reduced to 0.02 lambda and 0.07 lambda respectively, the transmission efficiency improves two-fold compared to that without nanoparticles. The numerical results can be used to understand the optical behavior of nano-particles and to improve the extraction efficiency of high brightness light-emitting-diodes(LEDs), through the use of nano-composite encapsulant.
physics.optics:A scheme of left-handed metamaterial (LHM) composed of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and conducting wires is proposed. The permeability of a probe field can be smoothly tuned over a wide range with another electromagnetic (coupling) field due to quantum interference effect. Similar to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of atomic systems, the absorption of the probe field can be strongly suppressed even in the case of negative permeability. There are two passbands of negative refractive index with low loss, which can be tuned with the coupling field.
physics.optics:We presents the results of study of focusing and imaging properties of double-lens system for hard x-ray radiation consisting of two Fresnel zone plates (ZP) made from silicon. We demonstrate for the first time the phenomenon of focusing by two crystal ZP located at significant distance from each other. We investigate by both theoretically and experimentally the peculiarities of intensity distribution at the focal plane during a scan by second ZP normally to the optical axis of the system. We investigate as well the intensity distribution along the optical axis for our double-lens system from crystal ZP. We realize experimentally a registration of the focused image of the object by means of double-lens system based on ZP. Measurements are performed on the beam line BM-5 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at the x-ray energy 9.4 keV. We elaborate a computer program for theoretical simulation of the optical properties of x-ray double-lens system based on ZPs. A calculation is made by convolution of transmission function and Kirchhoff propagator in paraxial approximation by means of Fast Fourier Transformation.
physics.optics:We investigate for the first time the enhancement of the stimulated Raman scattering in slow-light Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) photonic crystal line defect waveguides. By applying the Bloch-Floquet formalism to the guided modes in a planar photonic crystal, we develop a formalism that relates the intensity of the down-shifted Stokes signal to the pump intensity and the modal group velocities. The formalism is then applied to two prospective schemes for enhanced stimulated Raman generation in slow-light photonic crystal waveguides. The results demonstrate a maximum factor of 10^4 (66,000) enhancement with respect to SOI channel waveguides. Effects of two photon absorption, intrinsic scattering, and disorder with respect to slow-light Raman generation towards optically-pumped silicon amplifiers and lasers are also discussed.
physics.optics:The paper deals with optical excitations arising in a one-dimensional chain of identical spheres due optical coupling of whispering gallery modes (WGM). The band structure of these excitations depends significantly on the inter-mixing between WGMs characterized by different values of angular quantum number, $l$. We develop a general theory of the photonic band structure of these excitations taking these effects into account and applied it to several cases of recent experimental interest. In the case of bands originating from WQMs with the angular quantum number of the same parity, the calculated dispersion laws are in good qualitative agreement with recent experiment results. Bands resulting from hybridization of excitations resulting from whispering gallery modes with different parity of $l$ exhibits anomalous dispersion properties characterized by a gap in the allowed values of \emph{wave numbers} and divergence of group velocity.
physics.optics:We present what is to our knowledge the most complete 1-D numerical analysis of the evolution and the propagation dynamics of an ultrashort laser pulse in a Ti:Sapphire laser oscillator. This study confirms the dispersion managed model of mode-locking, and emphasizes the role of the Kerr nonlinearity in generating mode-locked spectra with a smooth and well-behaved spectral phase. A very good agreement with preliminary experimental measurements is found.
physics.optics:We observe experimentally that ensembles of quantum dots in three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals reveal strongly nonexponential time-resolved emission. These complex emission decay curves are analyzed with a continuous distribution of decay rates. The log-normal distribution describes the decays well for all studied lattice parameters. The distribution width is identified with variations of the radiative emission rates of quantum dots with various positions and dipole orientations in the unit cell. We find a striking sixfold change of the width of the distribution by varying the lattice parameter. This interpretation qualitatively agrees with the calculations of the 3D projected local density of states. We therefore conclude that fluorescence decay of ensembles of quantum dots is highly nonexponential to an extent that is controlled by photonic crystals.
physics.optics:The restrictions on the resolution of transmission devices formed by wire media (arrays of conductive cylinders) recently proposed in [Phys. Rev. B, 71, 193105 (2005)] and experimentally tested in [Phys. Rev. B, 73, 033108 (2006)] are studied in this paper using both analytical and numerical modeling. It is demonstrated that such transmission devices have sub-wavelength resolution that can in principle be made as fine as required by a specific application by controlling the lattice constant of the wire medium. This confirms that slabs of the wire medium are unique imaging devices at the microwave frequency range, and are capable of transmitting distributions of TM-polarized electric fields with nearly unlimited sub-wavelength resolution to practically arbitrary distances.
physics.optics:With the recent advancement in visualization devices over the last years, we are seeing a growing market for stereoscopic content. In order to convey 3D content by means of stereoscopic displays, one needs to transmit and display at least 2 points of view of the video content. This has profound implications on the resources required to transmit the content, as well as demands on the complexity of the visualization system. It is known that stereoscopic images are redundant, which may prove useful for compression and may have positive effect on the construction of the visualization device. In this paper we describe an experimental evaluation of data redundancy in color stereoscopic images. In the experiments with computer generated and real life and test stereo images, several observers visually tested the stereopsis threshold and accuracy of parallax measuring in anaglyphs and stereograms as functions of the blur degree of one of two stereo images and color saturation threshold in one of two stereo images for which full color 3D perception with no visible color degradations is maintained. The experiments support a theoretical estimate that one has to add, to data required to reproduce one of two stereoscopic images, only several percents of that amount of data in order to achieve stereoscopic perception.
physics.optics:The emission from a radiating source embedded in a photonic lattice is calculated. The analysis considers the photonic lattice and free space as a combined system. Furthermore, the radiating source and electromagnetic field are quantized. Results show the deviation of the photonic lattice spectrum from the blackbody distribution, with intracavity emission suppressed at certain frequencies and enhanced at others. In the presence of rapid population relaxation, where the photonic lattice and blackbody populations are described by the same equilibrium distribution, it is found that the enhancement does not result in output intensity exceeding that of the blackbody at the same frequency. However, for slow population relaxation, the photonic lattice population has a greater tendency to deviate from thermal equilibrium, resulting in output intensities exceeding those of the blackbody, even for identically pumped structures.
physics.optics:We present a method that formally calculates \emph{exact} frequency shifts of an electromagnetic field for arbitrary changes in the refractive index. The possible refractive index changes include both anisotropic changes and boundary shifts. Degenerate eigenmode frequencies pose no problems in the presented method. The approach relies on operator algebra to derive an equation for the frequency shifts, which eventually turn out in a simple and physically sound form. Numerically the equations are well-behaved, easy implementable, and can be solved very fast. Like in perturbation theory a reference system is first considered, which then subsequently is used to solve another related, but different system. For our method precision is only limited by the reference system basis functions and the error induced in frequency is of second order for first-order basis set error. As an example we apply our method to the problem of variations in the air-hole diameter in a photonic crystal fiber.
physics.optics:We demonstrate experimentally all-optical beam steering in modulated photonic lattices induced optically by three beam interference in a biased photorefractive crystal. We identify and characterize the key physical parameters governing the beam steering, and show that the spatial resolution can be enhanced by the additional effect of nonlinear beam self-localization.
physics.optics:We consider an index-guiding silica photonic crystal fiber with a triangular air-hole structure and a poled quadratic nonlinearity. By tuning the pitch and the relative hole size, second-harmonic generation with zero group-velocity mismatch is found for any fundamental wavelength above 780 nm. The phase-velocity mismatch has a lower limit with coherence lengths in the micron range. The dimensionless nonlinear parameter is inversely proportional to the pitch and proportional to the relative hole size. Selected cases show bandwidths suitable for 20 fs pulse-conversion with conversion efficiencies as high as 25%/mW.
physics.optics:We present a theoretical study of the dispersion relation of surface plasmon resonances of mesoscopic metal-dielectric-metal microspheres. By analyzing the solutions to Maxwell's equations, we obtain a simple geometric condition for which the system exhibits a band of surface plasmon modes whose resonant frequencies are weakly dependent on the multipole number. Using a modified Mie calculation, we find that a large number of modes belonging to this flat-dispersion band can be excited simultaneously by a plane wave, thus enhancing the absorption cross-section. We demonstrate that the enhanced absorption peak of the sphere is geometrically tunable over the entire visible range.
physics.optics:The Bergman-Milton bounds provide limits on the effective permittivity of a composite material comprising two isotropic dielectric materials. These provide tight bounds for composites arising from many conventional materials. We reconsider the Bergman-Milton bounds in light of the recent emergence of metamaterials, in which unconventional parameter ranges for relative permittivities are encountered. Specifically, it is demonstrated that: (a) for nondissipative materials the bounds may be unlimited if the constituent materials have relative permittivities of opposite signs; (b) for weakly dissipative materials characterized by relative permittivities with real parts of opposite signs, the bounds may be exceedingly large.
physics.optics:The silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO2) interface plays a crucial role in the performance, cost, and reliability of most modern microelectronic devices, from the basic transistor to flash memory, digital cameras, and solar cells. Today the gate oxide thickness of modern transistors is roughly 5 atomic layers, with 8 metal wire layers required to transport all the signals within a microprocessor. In addition to the increasing latency of such reduced-dimension metal wires, further "Moore's Law" scaling of transistor cost and density is predicted to saturate in the next decade. As a result, silicon-based microphotonics is being explored for the routing and generation of high-bandwidth signals. In comparison to the extensive knowledge of the electronic properties of the Si/SiO2 interface, little is known about the optical properties of Si surfaces used in microphotonics. In this Letter, we explore the optical properties of the Si surface in the telecommunication-relevant wavelength band of 1400-1600 nm. Utilizing a high quality factor (Q ~ 1.5x10^6) optical microresonator to provide sensitivity down to a fractional surface optical loss of 10^-7, we show that optical loss within Si microphotonic components can be dramatically altered by Si surface preparation, with fraction loss of 2 x 10^-5 measured for chemical oxide surfaces as compared to <2 x 10^-6 for hydrogen-terminated Si surfaces. These results indicate that the optical properties of Si surfaces can be significantly and reversibly altered by standard microelectronics treatments, and that stable, high optical quality surface passivation layers will be critical in future Si micro- and nano-photonic systems.
physics.optics:Experimental evidence of bouncing localized structures in a nonlinear optical system is reported.
physics.optics:By numerically integrating the three-dimensional Maxwell equations in the time domain with reference to a dispersive quadratically nonlinear material, we study second harmonic generation in planar photonic crystal microresonators. The proposed scheme allows efficient coupling of the pump radiation to the defect resonant mode. The out-coupled generated second harmonic is maximized by impedance matching the photonic crystal cavity to the output waveguide.
physics.optics:We study the optical interaction in a coupled dielectric microdisks by investigating the splitting of resonance positions of interacting whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and their pattern change, depending on the distance between the microdisks. It is shown that the interaction between the WGMs with odd parity about y-axis becomes appreciable at a distance less than a wavelength and causes directional emissions of the resulting interacting WGMs. The directionality of the interacting WGMs can be understood in terms of an effective boundary deformation in ray dynamical analysis. We also discuss about the oscillation of the splitting when the distance is greater than a wavelength.
physics.optics:We studied numerically and experimentally the effects of structural disorder on the performance of ultraviolet photonic crystal slab lasers. Optical gain selectively amplifies the high-quality modes of the passive system. For these modes, the in-plane and out-of-plane leakage rates may be automatically balanced in the presence of disorder. The spontaneous optimization of in-plane and out-of-plane confinement of light in a photonic crystal slab may lead to a reduction of the lasing threshold.
physics.optics:In this paper we proposed a novel overlay alignment method using two sets of identical photonic crystals (PhCs). In this method the reflection or transmission spectrum of the two overlaid photonic crystals is measured to help wafer tilt, yaw rotation, and translation aligning. The initial testing results with two 1D photonic crystals and analysis of the alignment accuracy are presented. This method is particularly useful in building photonic crystal stacks with nanoimprint lithography (NIL).
physics.optics:We consider the lateral shift of a light beam reflecting from a dielectric slab backed by a metal. It is found that the lateral shift of the reflected beam can be negative while the intensity of reflected beam is almost equal to the incident one under a certain condition. The explanation for the negativity of the lateral shift is given in terms of the interference of the reflected waves from the two interfaces. It is also shown that the lateral shift can be enhanced or suppressed under some other conditions. The numerical calculation on the lateral shift for a realistic Gaussian-shaped beam confirms our theoretical prediction.
physics.optics:In this paper we evaluate the cut-off properties of holey fibers (HFs) with a triangular lattice of air holes and the core formed by the removal of a single (HF1) or more air holes (HF3 and HF7). With the aid of finite-element simulations we determine the single-mode and multi-mode phases and also find the air hole diameters limiting the endlessly single-mode regime. From calculations of V and W parameters we find that in general HF1 is less susceptible to longitudinal non-uniformities compared to the other designs for equivalent effective areas. As an example we illustrate this general property for the particular case of a macro-bending induced loss.
physics.optics:We analyse the optical (or microwave) tunnelling properties of electromagnetic waves passing through thin films presenting a specific index profile providing a cut-off frequency, when they are used below this frequency. We show that contrary to the usual case of a square index profile, where tunnelling is accompanied with a strong attenuation of the wave due to reflection, such films present the possibility of a reflectionless tunnelling, where the incoming intensity is totally transmitted.
physics.optics:We present an exact treatment of wave propagation in some inhomogeneous thin films with highly space-dependent dielectric constant. It is based on a space transformation which replaces the physical space by the optical path. In the new space, the dispersion equation is that of a normal progressive wave. We will show that the dispersion properties of such films are plasma- or waveguide-like, the characteristic frequency being determined by the spatial characteristics of the dielectric constant's variations only. The theory is scalable, so that it can be applied in any wavelength range : optical, IR, radiofrequency, etc. depending only on the characteristic space scales. Several applications will be presented, concerning the reflection properties of such films (broadband anti-reflection, or dichroic coatings) or to the propagation and transmission through the film. We will show that depending on the type of space dependence, an incident wave can either propagate or tunnel through such films. We will investigate the behaviour of the light group-velocity and tunneling time inside or through such films. Though we can reproduce the phase-time saturation corresponding to the Hartman effect, analysis of the group velocity in the tunneling case shows no sign of superluminal propagation. A strong frequency dependence can be obtained in some situations, which allows to anticipate a strong reshaping of brodband laser pulses.
physics.optics:The use of photonic crystal and negative refractive index materials is known to improve resolution of optical microscopy and lithography devices down to 80 nm level. Here we demonstrate that utilization of well-known digital image recovery techniques allows us to further improve resolution of optical microscope down to 30 nm level. Our microscope is based on a flat dielectric mirror deposited onto an array of nanoholes in thin gold film. This two-dimensional photonic crystal mirror may have either positive or negative effective refractive index as perceived by surface plasmon polartions in the visible frequency range. The optical images formed by the mirror are enhanced using simple digital filters.
physics.optics:We present waveguides with photonic crystal cores, supporting energy propagation in subwavelength regions with a mode structure similar to that in telecom fibers. We design meta-materials for near-, mid-, and far-IR frequencies, and demonstrate efficient energy transfer to and from regions smaller than 1/25-th of the wavelength. Both positive- and negative-refractive index light transmissions are shown. Our approach, although demonstrated here in circular waveguides for some specific frequencies, is easily scalable from optical to IR to THz frequency ranges, and can be realized in a variety of waveguide geometries. Our design may be used for ultra high-density energy focusing, nm-resolution sensing, near-field microscopy, and high-speed all-optical computing.
physics.optics:The generation of watt-level cw narrow-linewidth sources at specific deep UV wavelengths corresponding to atomic cooling transitions usually employs external cavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) of moderate-power visible lasers in birefringent materials. In this work, we investigate a novel approach to cw deep-UV generation by employing the low-loss BBO in a monolithic walkoff-compensating structure [Zondy {\it{et al}}, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B {\bf{20}} (2003) 1675] to simultaneously enhance the effective nonlinear coefficient while minimizing the UV beam ellipticity under tight focusing. As a preliminary step to cavity-enhanced operation, and in order to apprehend the design difficulties stemming from the extremely low acceptance angle of BBO, we investigate and analyze the single-pass performance of a $L_c=8 $mm monolithic walk-off compensating structure made of 2 optically-contacted BBO plates cut for type-I critically phase-matched SHG of a cw $\lambda=570.4$nm dye laser. As compared with a bulk crystal of identical length, a sharp UV efficiency enhancement factor of 1.65 has been evidenced with the tandem structure, but at $\sim-1$nm from the targeted fundamental wavelength, highlighting the sensitivity of this technique when applied to a highly birefringent material such as BBO. Solutions to angle cut residual errors are identified so as to match accurately more complex periodic-tandem structure performance to any target UV wavelength, opening the prospect for high-power, good beam quality deep UV cw laser sources for atom cooling and trapping.
physics.optics:The double diffraction of white light can produce a thin-prism-like image in certain conditions by using ordinary diffraction gratings. The diffractive deviation of rays happens mainly in one direction because the diffracting elements are straight and parallel. We show similar images using elements where diffraction happens in both directions: spiral grooves discs. Some differences between the straight-groove and the almost circular curved-groove cases are described.
physics.optics:In this letter, we study the scattering of light by a single subwavelength slit in a metal screen. In contrast to previous theoretical works, we provide a microscopic description of the scattering process by emphasizing the generation of surface plasmons at the slit apertures. The analysis is supported by a rigorous formalism based on a normal-mode-decomposition technique and by a semi-analytical model which provides accurate formulae for the plasmonic generation strengths. The generation is shown to be fairly efficient for metals with a low conductivity, like gold in the visible regime. Verification of the theory is also shown by comparison with recent experimental data [H.F. Schouten et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 053901 (2005)].
physics.optics:Cerenkov radiation from cavities have been analyzed by quantum electrodynamic theory. Analytical expressions of some basic radiation properties including Einstein's $A$ and $B$ coefficients are derived and shown to be directly modified by the cavities. Coherent and incoherent radiations are analyzed with the aim of generating THz radiation from the devices.
physics.optics:Accurate analytic approximations are developed for the band gap boundaries and surface waves of a 1D photonic crystal, making use of the semiclassical theory recently developed by the authors: [Phys. Rev. E {69} (2004) 016612 and {70} (2004) 016606]. These analytic results provide useful insight on systematics of surface states.
physics.optics:We have observed the compensation of loss in metal by gain in interfacing dielectric in the mixture of aggregated silver nanoparticles and rhodamine 6G dye. The demonstrated six-fold enhancement of the Rayleigh scattering is the evidence of the increase of the quality factor of the surface plasmon (SP) resonance. The reported experimental observation paves the road to many practical applications of nanoplasmonics. We have also predicted and experimentally observed a suppression of the surface SP resonance in metallic nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric host with absorption.
physics.optics:Based on boundary conditions and dispersion relations, the anomalous propagation of waves incident from regular isotropic media into quasiisotropic media is investigated. It is found that the anomalous negative refraction, anomalous total reflection and oblique total transmission can occur in the interface associated with quasiisotropic media. The Brewster angles of E- and H-polarized waves in quasiisotropic media are also discussed. It is shown that the propagation properties of waves in quasiisotropic media are significantly different from those in isotropic and anisotropic media.
physics.optics:This paper presents an analysis of how to calculate bit error ratio (BER) with physical explanation for optically pre-amplified DPSK receivers using optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) demodulation and balanced detection. It is shown that BER calculation method for this kind of receivers is different from the conventional calculation method used widely for IM/DD receivers. An analytical relationship in receiver sensitivity between DPSK receivers using MZI demodulation with balanced detection and IM/DD receivers (or DPSK receivers using MZI demodulation and single-port detection) is given based on the Gaussian noise approximation. Our calculation method correctly predicts the 3-dB improvement of receiver sensitivity by using balanced detection over single-port detection or IM/DD receivers. Furthermore, quantum-limited DPSK receivers with MZI demodulation are also analyzed.
physics.optics:Polarization-resolved second-harmonic spectra are obtained from the resonant modes of a two-dimensional planar photonic crystal microcavity patterned in a free-standing InP slab. The photonic crystal microcavity is comprised of a single missing-hole defect in a hexagonal photonic crystal host formed with elliptically-shaped holes. The cavity supports two orthogonally-polarized resonant modes split by 60 wavenumbers. Sum-frequency data are reported from the nonlinear interaction of the two coherently excited modes, and the polarization dependence is explained in terms of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor of the host InP.
physics.optics:We characterize the reflectance peak near the Brewster angle for both an interface between two dielectric media and a single slab. To approach this problem analytically, we approximate the reflectance by a first-order diagonal Pad\'e. In this way, we calculate the width and the skewness of the peak and we show that, although they present a well-resolved maximum, they are otherwise not so markedly dependent on the refractive index.
physics.optics:Based on boundary condition and dispersion relation, the superluminal group velocity in an anisotropic metamaterial (AMM) is investigated. The superluminal propagation is induced by the hyperbolic dispersion relation associated with the AMM. It is shown that a modulated Gaussian beam exhibits a superluminal group velocity which depends on the choice of incident angles and optical axis angles. The superluminal propagation does not violate the theory of special relativity because the group velocity is the velocity of the peak of the localized wave packet which does not carry information. It is proposed that a triglycine sulfate (TGS) crystal can be designed and the superluminal group velocity can be measured experimentally.
physics.optics:We generate experimentally different types of two-dimensional Bloch waves of a square photonic lattice by employing the phase imprinting technique. We probe the local dispersion of the Bloch modes in the photonic lattice by analyzing the linear diffraction of beams associated with the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, and also distinguish the regimes of normal, anomalous, and anisotropic diffraction through observations of nonlinear self-action effects.
physics.optics:Channel drop filters in a plasmon-polaritons metal are studied. It shows that light can be efficiently dropped. Results obtained by the FDTD method are consistent with those from coupled mode theory. It also shows, without considering the loss of the metal, that the quality factor for the channel drop system reaches 4000. The quality factor decreases significantly if we take into account the loss, which also leads to a weak drop efficiency.
physics.optics:We analytically study the linear propagation of arbitrarily shaped light-pulses through an absorbing medium with a narrow transparency-window or through a resonant amplifying medium. We point out that, under certain general conditions, the pulse acquires a nearly Gaussian shape, irrespective of its initial shape and of the spectral profile of the line. We explicitly derive in this case the pulse parameters, including its skewness responsible for a deviation of the delay of the pulse maximum from the group delay. We illustrate our general results by analysing the slow-light experiments having demonstrated the largest fractional pulse-delays
physics.optics:We present a fully relativistic analysis of Bessel beams revealing some noteworthy features that are not explicit in the standard description. It is shown that there is a reference frame in which the field takes a particularly simple form, the wave appearing to rotate in circles. The concepts of polarization and angular momentum for Bessel beams is also reanalyzed.
physics.optics:We show that the finite-difference frequency-domain method is well-suited to study subwavelength lensing effects in left-handed materials (LHM's) and related problems. The method is efficient and works in the frequency domain, eliminating the need for specifying dispersion models for the permeability and permittivity as required by the popular finite-difference time-domain method. We show that "superlensing" in a LHM slab with refractive index n = -1 can be approached by introducing an arbitrarily small loss term. We also study a thin silver slab, which can exhibit subwavelength imaging in the electrostatic limit.
physics.optics:We compare the asymmetry-induced exchange splitting delta_1 of the bright-exciton ground-state doublet in self-assembled (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots, determined by Faraday rotation, with its homogeneous linewidth gamma, obtained from the radiative decay in time-resolved photoluminescence. Post-growth thermal annealing of the dot structures leads to a considerable increase of the homogeneous linewidth, while a strong reduction of the exchange splitting is simultaneously observed. The annealing can be tailored such that delta_1 and gamma become comparable, whereupon the carriers are still well confined. This opens the possibility to observe polarization entangled photon pairs through the biexciton decay cascade.
physics.optics:Nonlocal communication between two laser light beams is experimented in a photochromic polymer thin films. Information exchange between the beams is mediated by the self-induction of a surface relief pattern. The exchanged information is related to the pitch and orientation of the grating. Both are determined by the incident beam. The process can be applied to experiment on a new kind of logic gates.
physics.optics:Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown that imaging with resolution well beyond the diffraction limit can be obtained with so-called superlenses. Images formed by such superlenses are, however, in the near field only, or a fraction of wavelength away from the lens. In this paper, we propose a far-field superlens (FSL) device which is composed of a planar superlens with periodical corrugation. We show in theory that when an object is placed in close proximity of such a FSL, a unique image can be formed in far-field. As an example, we demonstrate numerically that images of 40 nm lines with a 30 nm gap can be obtained from far-field data with properly designed FSL working at 376nm wavelength.
physics.optics:The variance of nonlinear phase noise is analyzed by including the effect of intrachannel cross-phase modulation (IXPM)-induced nonlinear phase noise. Consistent with Ho and Wang [1] but in contrary to the conclusion of both Kumar [2] and Green et al. [3], the variance of nonlinear phase noise does not decrease much with the increase of chromatic dispersion. The results are consistent with a careful reexamination of both Kumar [2] and Green et al. [3].
physics.optics:An unambiguous proof of lasing in an active nanocavity with ultrahigh spontaneous emission coupling factor (beta = 0.65) is presented. To distinguish the subtle lasing threshold features from possible material-related phenomena, such as saturable absorption in the gain medium, a series of active nanocavities with different values of beta have been designed to systematically approach the high-beta device. The demonstration of the lasing threshold is obtained through the observation of the transition from thermal to coherent light photon statistics that is well understood and identified in the beta << 1 lasing regime. The systematic investigation allows a more definitive validation of the onset of lasing in these active nanocavities.
physics.optics:Very recently we present a theory to discuss the nature of light and show that the quantization of light energy in vacuum can be derived directly from classical electromagnetic theory. In the theory a key concept of stability of statistical distribution and a variational procedure searching for those of relatively stable statistical distributions were introduced. This is a classical interpretation to the concept and method concerned. It would be helpful for avoiding some of possible obsession from the variational procedure and its final quantum result.
physics.optics:Theoretical and experimental evidence of light driven structuring of glasses is presented. We show that light overcomes Coulomb repulsion and effective electron-electron interaction in glasses under strong light pumping becomes attractive. As the result homogenious distribution of trapped electrons gets unstable and macroscopic electron bunches are grown. At different conditions ordered structures with period about 2 microns determined by internal properties of the material are formed These structures were observed in ablation: surface profile after laser treatment reveals ordered pattern corresponding to the light induced electron domains.
physics.optics:We consider chromatic dispersion of capillary tubes and photonic crystal fibers infiltrated with liquid crystals. A perturbative scheme for inclusion of material dispersion of both liquid crystal and the surrounding waveguide material is derived. The method is used to calculate the chromatic dispersion at different temperatures.
physics.optics:An optical vortex (phase singularity) with a high topological strength resides on the axis of a high-order light beam. The breakup of this vortex under elliptic perturbation into a straight row of unit strength vortices is described. This behavior is studied in helical Ince-Gauss beams and astigmatic, generalized Hermite-Laguerre-Gauss beams, which are perturbations of Laguerre-Gauss beams. Approximations of these beams are derived for small perturbation, in which a neighborhood of the axis can be approximated by a polynomial in the complex plane: a Chebyshev polynomial for Ince-Gauss beams, and a Hermite polynomial for astigmatic beams.
physics.optics:An optical vortex, produced at one point in an optical beam, would propagate through an optical system to another point where the vortex can be used for some purpose. However, asymmetrical optical elements in such a system can cause astigmatism or at least distroy the rotational symmetry of the beam, which may affect the propagation of the vortex in an undesirable way. While an optical vortex in a rotationally symmetric, stigmatic Gaussian beam retains its initial morphology for as far as it propagates, the morphology of an optical vortex in an asymmetric or astigmatic Gaussian beam changes. The vortex can even be replaced by another with the opposite topological charge. We consider the behavior of single noncanonical vortices propagating in Gaussian beams that are asymmetric and/or astigmatic. General expressions for the vortex trajectories are provided. The locations of the flip planes and the evolution of the anisotropy of the vortex are considered for different non-ideal situations.
physics.optics:Transmission spectra of metallic films or membranes perforated by arrays of subwavelength slits or holes have been widely interpreted as resonance absorption by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Alternative interpretations involving evanescent waves diffracted on the surface have also been proposed. These two approaches lead to divergent predictions for some surface wave properties. Using far-field interferometry, we have carried out a series of measurements on elementary one-dimensional (1-D) subwavelength structures with the aim of testing key properties of the surface waves and comparing them to predictions of these two points of view.
physics.optics:The resonant buildup of light within optical microcavities elevates the radiation pressure which mediates coupling of optical modes to the mechanical modes of a microcavity. Above a certain threshold pump power, regenerative mechanical oscillation occurs causing oscillation of certain mechanical eigenmodes. Here, we present a methodology to spatially image the micro-mechanical resonances of a toroid microcavity using a scanning probe technique. The method relies on recording the induced frequency shift of the mechanical eigenmode when in contact with a scanning probe tip. The method is passive in nature and achieves a sensitivity sufficient to spatially resolve the vibrational mode pattern associated with the thermally agitated displacement at room temperature. The recorded mechanical mode patterns are in good qualitative agreement with the theoretical strain fields as obtained by finite element simulations.
physics.optics:The Method a Raman of spectroscopy studies allocation of molecules in ternary mix-crystals of a p-dibromobenzene of p-dichlorobenzene and p-bromochlorobenzene. It is shown, that the mutual concentration of builders depends on requirements of growing. Was possibly as a uniform modification of concentration of all builders along a specimen, and a wavy modification of concentration of two substances.
physics.optics:We investigate the optical response of two sub-wavelength grooves on a metallic screen, separated by a sub-wavelength distance. We show that the Fabry-Perot-like mode, already observed in one-dimensional periodic gratings and known for a single slit, splits into two resonances in our system : a symmetrical mode with a small Q-factor, and an antisymmetric one which leads to a much stronger light enhancement. This behavior results from the near-field coupling of the grooves. Moreover, the use of a second incident wave allows to control the localization of the photons in the groove of our choice, depending on the phase difference between the two incident waves. The system exactly acts as a sub-wavelength optical switch operated from far-field.
physics.optics:While the alignment and rotation of microparticles in optical traps have received increased attention recently, one of the earliest examples has been almost totally neglected the alignment of particles relative to the beam axis, as opposed to about the beam axis. However, since the alignment torques determine how particles align in a trap, they are directly relevant to practical applications. Lysozyme crystals are an ideal model system to study factors determining the orientation of nonspherical birefringent particles in a trap. Both their size and their aspect ratio can be controlled by the growth parameters, and their regular shape makes computational modeling feasible. We show that both external shape and internal birefringence anisotropy contribute to the alignment torque. Three-dimensionally trapped elongated objects either align with their long axis parallel or perpendicular to the beam axis depending on their size. The shape-dependent torque can exceed the torque due to birefringence, and can align negative uniaxial particles with their optic axis parallel to the electric field, allowing an application of optical torque about the beam axis.
physics.optics:We demonstrate experimentally that the interactions between a pair of nonlocal spatial optical solitons in a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) can be controlled by the degree of nonlocality. For a given beam width, the degree of nonlocality can be modulated by varying the pretilt angle of NLC molecules via the change of the bias. When the pretilt angle is smaller than pi/4, the nonlocality is strong enough to guarantee the independence of the interactions on the phase difference of the solitons. As the pretilt angle increases, the degree of nonlocality decreases. When the degree is below its critical value, the two solitons behavior in the way like their local counterpart: the two in-phase solitons attract and the two out-of-phase solitons repulse.
physics.optics:Raman spectroscopies are carried out by the Method polarizable examinations of the lattice oscillations of p-chloronitrobenzene at temperature 293 K. The led matching of spectrums of p-chloronitrobenzene with p-bromochlorobenzene and p-dibromobenzene has shown that the significant line broadening in p-chloronitrobenzene is caused not only clutter in allocation of molecules concerning parasubstitution benzol. It is necessary to consider also and clutter in rotational displacements of the nitro of group concerning a plane of a molecule. Calculations of frequency spectra were led on a method the Dyne.
physics.optics:We present an analytical model of the resonantly enhanced transmission of light through a subwavelength nm-size slit in a thick metal film. The simple formulae for the transmitted electromagnetic fields and the transmission coefficient are derived by using the narrow-slit approximation and the Green's function formalism for the solution of Maxwell's equations. The resonance wavelengths are in agreement with the semi-analytical model [Y. Takakura, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5601 (2001)], which solves the wave equations by using the Rayleigh field expansion. Our formulae, however, show great resonant enhancement of a transmitted wave, while the Rayleigh expansion model predicts attenuation. The difference is attributed to the near-field subwavelength diffraction, which is not considered by the Rayleigh-like expansion models.
physics.optics:A critical review of experimental studies of the so-called 'slow light' arising due to anomalously high steepness of the refractive index dispersion under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency or coherent population oscillations is presented. It is shown that a considerable amount of experimental evidence for observation of the 'slow light' is not related to the low group velocity of light and can be easily interpreted in terms of a standard model of interaction of light with a saturable absorber.
physics.optics:The dynamics of two-dimensional electromagnetic (EM) pulses through one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPC) has been theoretically studied. Employing the time expectation integral over the Poynting vector as the arrival time [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2370, (2000)], we show that the superluminal tunneling process of EM pulses is the propagation of the net forward-going Poynting vector through the 1DPC, and the Hartman effect is due to the saturation effect of the arrival time (smaller and smaller time accumulated) of the net forward energy flow caused by the interference effect of the forward and the backward field (from the interfaces of each layer) happened in the region before the 1DPC and in the front part of the 1DPC.
physics.optics:The noise figure and photon probability distribution are calculated for coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) where an anti-Stokes signal is converted to Stokes. We find that the minimum noise figure is ~ 3dB.
physics.optics:The application of the copper bromide (CuBr) laser as an attractive tool in the micro-machining of different materials has been demonstrated. High-quality drilling by trepanning and precision cutting was established on several materials with a negligible heat-affected zone (HAZ). That good performance was a result of the combination of high power visible radiation, short pulses, and close to the diffraction-limited laser beam quality with high-speed galvo scanner beam steering.
physics.optics:Excerpt: We apply the wavelet transform to the fractal Talbot effect in both diffraction and fiber dispersion. In the first case, the self similar character of the transverse paraxial field at irrational multiples of the Talbot distance is confirmed, whereas in the second case it is shown that the field is not self similar for supergaussian pulses. Finally, a high-precision measurement of irrational distances employing the fractal index determined with the wavelet transform is pointed out
physics.optics:Electron spin coherence has been generated optically in n-type modulation doped (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) which contain on average a single electron per dot. The coherence arises from resonant excitation of the QDs by circularly-polarized laser pulses, creating a coherent superposition of an electron and a trion state. Time dependent Faraday rotation is used to probe the spin precession of the optically oriented electrons about a transverse magnetic field. Spin coherence generation can be controlled by pulse intensity, being most efficient for (2n+1)pi-pulses.
physics.optics:We present ultrafast all-optical switching measurements of Si woodpile photonic band gap crystals. The crystals are spatially homogeneously excited, and probed by measuring reflectivity over an octave in frequency (including the telecom range) as a function of time. After 300 fs, the complete stop band has shifted to higher frequencies as a result of optically excited free carriers. The switched state relaxes quickly with a time constant of 18 ps. We present a quantitative analysis of switched spectra with theory for finite photonic crystals. The induced changes in refractive index are well described by a Drude model with a carrier relaxation time of 10 fs. We briefly discuss possible applications of high-repetition rate switching of photonic crystal cavities.
physics.optics:Quasiclassical approach and geometric optics allow to describe rather accurately whispering gallery modes in convex axisymmetric bodies. Using this approach we obtain practical formulas for the calculation of eigenfrequencies and radiative Q-factors in dielectrical spheroid and compare them with the known solutions for the particular cases and with numerical calculations. We show how geometrical interpretation allows expansion of the method on arbitrary shaped axisymmetric bodies.
physics.optics:Pairing together material slabs with opposite signs for the real parts of their constitutive parameters has been shown to lead to interesting and unconventional properties that are not otherwise observable for single slabs. One such case was demonstrated analytically for the conjugate (i.e., complementary) pairing of infinite planar slabs of epsilon-negative (ENG) and mu-negative (MNG) media [A. Alu, and N. Engheta, IEEE Trans. Antennas Prop., 51, 2558 (2003)]. There it was shown that when these two slabs are juxtaposed and excited by an incident plane wave, resonance, complete tunneling, total transparency and reconstruction of evanescent waves may occur in the steady-state regime under a monochromatic excitation, even though each of the two slabs by itself is essentially opaque to the incoming radiation. This may lead to virtual imagers with sub-wavelength resolution and other anomalous phenomena overcoming the physical limit of diffraction. Here we explore how a transient sinusoidal signal that starts at t = 0 interacts with such an ENG-MNG pair of finite size using an FDTD technique. Multiple reflections and transmissions at each interface are shown to build up to the eventual steady state response of the pair, and during this process one can observe how the growing exponential phenomenon may actually occur inside this bilayer.
physics.optics:Following our recent theoretical development of the concept of nano-inductors, nano-capacitors and nano-resistors at optical frequencies and the possibility of synthesizing more complex nano-scale circuits, here we theoretically investigate in detail the problem of optical nano-transmission-lines (NTL) that can be envisioned by properly joining together arrays of these basic nano-scale circuit elements. We show how, in the limit in which these basic circuit elements are closely packed together, the NTLs can be regarded as stacks of plasmonic and non-plasmonic planar slabs, which may be designed to effectively exhibit the properties of planar metamaterials with forward (right-handed) or backward (left-handed) operation. With the proper design, negative refraction and left-handed propagation are shown to be possible in these planar plasmonic guided-wave structures, providing possibilities for sub-wavelength focusing and imaging in planar optics, and laterally-confined waveguiding at IR and visible frequencies. The effective material parameters for such NTLs are derived, and the connection and analogy between these optical NTLs and the double-negative and double-positive metamaterials are also explored. Physical insights and justification for the results are also presented.
physics.optics:Using an extended plane-wave-based transfer-matrix method, the photonic band structures and the corresponding transmission spectrum of a two-dimensional left-handed photonic crystal are calculated. Comparisons between the periodic structure with a single left-handed cylindric rod are made, and many interesting similarities are found. It is shown that, due to the localized surface polaritons presented by an isolated left-handed rod, there exist many exciting physical phenomena in high-dimensional left-handed photonic crystals. As direct results of coupling of the localized surface polaritons of neighboring left-handed rod, a lot of almost dispersionless bands, anti-crossing behavior, and a zero $\bar{n}$ gap are exhibited in the left-handed periodic structure. Moreover, in a certain frequency region, except distorted by a lot of anti-crossing behavior, there exists a continual dispersion relation, which can be explained by the long-wavelength approximation. It is also pointed out that high-dimensional left-handed photonic crystals can be used to design narrow-band filter.
physics.optics:Utilizing the underlying physics of evanescent wave amplification by a negative-refractive-index slab, it is shown that evanescent waves with specific spatial frequencies can also be amplified without any reflection simply by two dielectric planar waveguides. The simple configuration allows one to take advantage of the high resolution limit of a high-refractive-index material without contact with the object.
physics.optics:The analysis of optical pulse generation by phase modulation of narrowband continuous-wave light, and subsequent propagation through a group-delay-dispersion circuit, is usually performed in terms of the so-called bunching parameter. This heuristic approach does not provide theoretical support for the electrooptic flat-top-pulse generation reported recently. Here, we perform a waveform synthesis in terms of the Fresnel images of the periodically phase-modulated input light. In particular, we demonstrate flat-top-pulse generation with a duty ratio of 50% at a quarter of the Talbot condition for the sinusoidal phase modulation. Finally, we propose a binary modulation format to generate a well-defined square-wave-type optical bit pattern.
physics.optics:Using an analytical expression for an integral involving Bessel and Legendre functions we succeeded to obtain the partial wave decomposition of a general optical beam at an arbitrary location from the origin. We also showed that the solid angle integration will eliminate the radial dependence of the expansion coefficients. The beam shape coefficients obtained are given by an exact expression in terms of single or double integrals. These integrals can be evaluated numerically in a short time scale. We presented the results for the case of linear polarized Gaussian beam.
physics.optics:What we believe to be a new type of resonant coupling of an incident bulk wave into guided modes of a slab with a thick holographic grating is shown to occur in the presence of strong frequency detunings of the Bragg condition. This happens through the reflection of the strongly noneigen +1 diffracted order with the slab-grating boundaries, the resultant reflected waves forming a guided slab mode. Rigorous coupled-wave analysis is used for the numerical analysis of the predicted resonant effects. Possible applications include enhanced options for the design of multiplexing and demultiplexing systems, optical signal-processing devices, optical sensors, and measurement techniques.
physics.optics:A theoretical and experimental investigation of the effects of mode coupling in a resonant macro- scopic quantum device is achieved in the case of a ring laser. In particular, we show both analytically and experimentally that such a device can be used as a rotation sensor provided the effects of mode coupling are controlled, for example through the use of an additional coupling. A possible general- ization of this example to the case of another resonant macroscopic quantum device is discussed.
physics.optics:Superluminal behavior has been extensively studied in recent years, especially with regard to the topic of superluminality in the propagation of a signal. Particular interest has been devoted to Bessel-X waves propagation, since some experimental results showed that these waves have both phase and group velocities greater that light velocity c. However, because of the lack of an exact definition of signal velocity, no definite answer about the signal propagation (or velocity of information) has been found. The present paper is a short note that deals in a general way with this vexed question. By analyzing the field of existence of the Bessel X-wave in pseudo-Euclidean space-time, it is possible to give a general description of the propagation, and to overcome the specific question related to a definition of signal velocity.
physics.optics:We present in this paper results on a new dissemination system of ultra-stable reference signal at 100 MHz on a standard fibre network. The 100 MHz signal is simply transferred by amplitude modulation of an optical carrier. Two different approaches for compensating the noise introduced by the link have been implemented. The limits of the two systems are analyzed and several solution suggested in order to improve the frequency stability and to further extend the distribution distance. Nevertheless, our system is a good tool for the best cold atom fountains comparison between laboratories, up to 100 km, with a relative frequency resolution of 10-14 at one second integration time and 10-17 for one day of measurement. The distribution system may be upgraded to fulfill the stringent distribution requirements for the future optical clocks.
physics.optics:Polymer filling of the air holes of Indium Phosphide based two-dimensional photonic crystals is reported. After infiltration of the holes with a liquid monomer and solidification of the infill in situ by thermal polymerization, complete filling is proven using scanning electron microscopy. Optical transmission measurements of a filled photonic crystal structure exhibit a redshift of the air band, confirming the complete filling.
physics.optics:We observe pulse delays of up to twenty times the input pulse duration when 200-ps laser pulses pass through a hot Rb 85 vapor cell. The pulse peak travels with a velocity equal to c/20, and the energy transmission is 5%. For pulses with linewidth greater than typical features in the atomic dispersion, pulse delay is predicted and observed for all center frequencies near resonance. Pulse advance is never observed. The measurements are in good agreement with a three-level linear-dispersion calculation. We are able to control the amount of delay by using a steady-state laser beam for optical pumping of the ground states prior to sending in the test pulse.
physics.optics:Efficient nonresonant optical pumping of a high-Q scar mode in a two-dimensional quadrupole-deformed microlaser has been demonstrated based on ray and wave chaos. Three-fold enhancement in the lasing power was achieved at a properly chosen pumping angle. The experimental result is consistent with ray tracing and wave overlap integral calculations.
physics.optics:We analyze theoretically and experimentally the influence of current noise on the longitudinal mode hopping dynamics of a bulk semiconductor laser. It is shown that the mean residence times on each mode have different sensitivity to external noise added to the bias current. In particular, an increase of the noise level enhances the residence time on the longitudinal mode that dominates at low current, evidencing the multiplicative nature of the stochastic process. A two-mode rate equation model for semiconductor laser is able to reproduce the experimental findings. Under a suitable separation of the involved time scales, the model can be reduced to a 1D bistable potential system with a multiplicative stochastic term related to the current noise strength. The reduced model clarifies the influence of the different noise sources on the hopping dynamics.
physics.optics:The filamentational instability of spatially broadband femtosecond optical pulses in air is investigated by means of a kinetic wave equation for spatially incoherent photons. An explicit expression for the spatial amplification rate is derived and analyzed. It is found that the spatial spectral broadening of the pulse can lead to stabilization of the filamentation instability. Thus, optical smoothing techniques could optimize current applications of ultra-short laser pulses, such as atmospheric remote sensing.
physics.optics:We report in this paper what is to our knowledge the first observation of a time-resolved diffusing wave spectroscopy signal recorded by transillumination through a thick turbid medium: the DWS signal is measured for a fixed photon transit time, which opens the possibility of improving the spatial resolution. This technique could find biomedical applications, especially in mammography.
physics.optics:We theoretically investigate the existence and properties of hybrid surface waves forming at interfaces between left-handed materials and dielectric birefringent media. The existence conditions of such waves are found to be highly relaxed in comparison to the original hybrid surface waves, discovered by Dyakonov, in configurations involving birefringent materials and right-handed media. Hybrid surface waves in left-handed materials feature remarkable properties: (i) a high degree of localization and (ii) coexistence of several guided solutions. The existence of several hybrid surface waves for the same parameter set is linked to the birefringent nature of the medium whereas the strong localization is related to the presence of the left-handed material. The hybrid surface modes appear for large areas in the parameter space.
physics.optics:The coherence length of the thermal electromagnetic field near a planar surface has a minimum value related to the nonlocal dielectric response of the material. We perform two model calculations of the electric energy density and the field's degree of spatial coherence. Above a polar crystal, the lattice constant gives the minimum coherence length. It also gives the upper limit to the near field energy density, cutting off its $1/z^3$ divergence. Near an electron plasma described by the semiclassical Lindhard dielectric function, the corresponding length scale is fixed by plasma screening to the Thomas-Fermi length. The electron mean free path, however, sets a larger scale where significant deviations from the local description are visible.
physics.optics:The basic assumption of the authors of manuscript arXiv:physics/0603175v1 (21 Mar 2006) is that a laser wave differs from a plane wave because of photon coherence. This is not true and therefore their conclusion is also wrong.
physics.optics:We discuss optical constants in artificial metamaterials showing negative magnetic permeability and electric permittivity. Using effective field theory, we calculate effective permeability of nanofabricated media composed of pairs of identical gold nano-pillars with magnetic response in the visible spectrum.
physics.optics:Laser trapping near the surface of a nanostructured substrate is demonstrated. Stable microbubbles with radii of 1-20micrometers have been created and manipulated with sub-micron precision by a focused laser beam in an immersion oil covering arrays of pairs of gold nanopillars deposited on a glass substrate. The threshold for bubble creation and trapping characteristics depended on near-field coupling of nanopillars. The nanometric laser tweezers showed giant trapping efficiency of Q~50 for the trapped microbubbles.
physics.optics:We have investigated quasi-eigenmodes of a quadrupolar deformed microcavity by extensive numerical calculations. The spectral structure is found to be quite regular, which can be explained on the basis of the fact that the microcavity is an open system. The far-field emission directions of the modes show unexpected similarity irrespective of their distinct shapes in phase space. This universal directionality is ascribed to the influence from the geometry of the unstable manifolds in the corresponding ray dynamics.
physics.optics:We report a theoretical study of clusters of evanescently-coupled 2D whispering-gallery (WG) mode optical micro-cavities (termed "photonic molecules") as chemosensing and biosensing platforms. Photonic molecules (PMs) supporting modes with narrow linewidths, wide mode spacing, and greatly enhanced sensitivity to the changes in the dielectric constant of their environment and to the presence of individual sub-wavelength sized nanoparticles in the PM evanescent-field region are numerically designed. This type of optical biosensor can be fabricated in a variety of material platforms and integrated on a single chip that makes it a promising candidate for a small and robust lab-on-a-chip device. Possible applications of the developed methodology and the designed PM structures to the near-field microscopy, single nano-emitter microcavity lasing, and cavity-controlled single-molecule fluorescence enhancement are also discussed.
physics.optics:We have developed a technique for realizing a two-dimensional quadrupolar microcavity with its deformation variable from 0% to 20% continuously. We employed a microjet ejected from a noncircular orifice in order to generate a stationary column with modulated quadrupolar deformation in its cross section. Wavelength red shifts of low-order cavity modes due to shape deformation were measured and were found to be in good agreement with the wave calculation for the same deformation, indicating the observed deformation is quadrupolar in nature.
physics.optics:Experimental investigation of the characteristics of quasi-bound states of a quadrupole deformed microcavity has revealed five distinct mode groups in cavity emission spectra with cavity quality factors different by orders of magnitude and consistently with much different intracavity mode distributions but with almost universal far-field emission patterns. These universal directionality of high Q modes are explained by a subtle manifestation of unstable manifolds of classical chaos in the formation of quasi-bound states.
physics.optics:We analyze theoretically the effect of technical fluctuations on laser lineshape in terms of statistics of amplitude and phase noise and their respective bandwidths. While the phase noise tends to broaden the linewidth as the magnitude of the noise increases, the amplitude noise brings out an additional structure with its spectral density reflecting the magnitude of the noise. The effect of possible coupling between those two noises is also discussed.
physics.optics:We demonstrate lineshape measurement of an extreme-weak amplitude fluctuating light source by using the photon-counting-based second-order correlation spectroscopy combined with the heterodyne technique. The amplitude fluctuation of a finite bandwidth introduces a low-lying spectral structure in the lineshape and thus its effect can be isolated from that of the phase fluctuation. Our technique provides extreme sensitivity suited for single-atom-level applications.
physics.optics:A nanofabricated regular array of coupled gold nano-pillars is employed to detect local indices of refraction of different liquids using a shift of an antisymmetric plasmon resonance peak observed in the reflection spectra. The peak spectral position is found to be a unique function of the local refractive index for a wide range of indices. We discuss possible applications of the fabricated nanostructured arrays in bio and chemical sensors.
physics.optics:We report that $> 80%$ of the photons generated inside a photonic crystal slab resonator can be funneled within a small divergence angle of $\pm 30^\circ$. The far-field radiation properties of a photonic crystal slab resonant mode are modified by tuning the cavity geometry and by placing a reflector below the cavity. The former method directly shapes the near-field distribution so as to achieve directional and linearly-polarized far-field patterns. The latter modification takes advantage of the interference effect between the original waves and the reflected waves to enhance the energy-directionality. We find that, regardless of the slab thickness, the optimum distance between the slab and the reflector closely equals one wavelength of the resonance under consideration. We have also discussed an efficient far-field simulation algorithm based on the finite-difference time-domain method and the near- to far-field transformation.
physics.optics:We present an investigation of the modulational instability of partially coherent signals in electrical transmission lines. Starting from the modified Ginzburg-Landau equations and the Wigner-Moyal representation, we derive a nonlinear dispersion relation for the modulational instability. It is found that the effect of signal broadbandness reduces the growth rate of the modulational instability.
physics.optics:Bright blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on 1,4,5,8,N-pentamethylcarbazole (PMC) and on dimer of N-ethylcarbazole (N,N'-diethyl-3,3'-bicarbazyl) (DEC) as emitting layers or as dopants in a 4,4'-bis(2,2'-diphenylvinyl)-1,1'-biphenyl (DPVBi) matrix are described. Pure blue-light with the C.I.E. coordinates x = 0.153 y = 0.100, electroluminescence efficiency \eta_{EL} of 0.4 cd/A, external quantum efficiency \eta_{ext.} of 0.6% and luminance L of 236 cd/m2 (at 60 mA/cm2) were obtained with PMC as an emitter and the 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenantroline (BCP) as a hole-blocking material in five-layer emitting devices. The highest efficiencies \eta_{EL.} of 4.7 cd/A, and \eta_{ext} = 3.3% were obtained with a four-layer structure and a DPVBi DEC-doped active layer (CIE coordinates x = 0.158, y=0.169, \lambda_{peak} = 456 nm). The \eta_{ext.} value is one the highest reported at this wavelength for blue OLEDs and is related to an internal quantum efficiency up to 20%.
physics.optics:A novel approach is used to enhance by nearly two orders of magnitude the conversion efficiency of a 125 nm-coherent source, based on four-wave mixing in room-temperature mercury vapor. Saturation issues are observed and discussed.
physics.optics:Phase steps are an important type of wavefront aberrations generated by large telescopes with segmented mirrors. In a closed-loop correction cycle these phase steps have to be measured with the highest possible precision using natural reference stars, that is with a small number of photons. In this paper the classical Fisher information of statistics is used for calculating the Cramer-Rao bound, which determines the limit to the precision with which the height of the steps can be estimated in an unbiased fashion with a given number of photons and a given measuring device. Four types of measurement devices are discussed: a Shack-Hartmann sensor with one small cylindrical lenslet covering a sub-aperture centred over a border, a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer, a Foucault test, and a curvature sensor. The Cramer-Rao bound is calculated for all sensors under ideal conditions, that is narrowband measurements without additional noise or disturbances apart from the photon shot noise. This limit is compared with the ultimate quantum statistical limit for the estimate of such a step which is independent of the measuring device. For the Shack-Hartmann sensor, the effects on the Cramer-Rao bound of broadband measurements, finite sampling, and disturbances such as atmospheric seeing and detector readout noise are also investigated. The methods presented here can be used to compare the precision limits of various devices for measuring phase steps and for optimising the parameters of the devices. Under ideal conditions the Shack-Hartmann and the Foucault devices nearly attain the ultimate quantum statistical limits, whereas the Mach-Zehnder and the curvature devices each require approximately twenty times as many photons in order to reach the same precision.
physics.optics:Group delay for a reflected light pulse from a weakly absorbing dielectric slab is theoretically investigated, and large negative group delay is found for weak absorption near a resonance of the slab ($Re(kd)=m\pi$). The group delays for both the reflected and transmitted pulses will be saturated with the increase of the absorption.
physics.optics:An analytic solution for Bragg grating with linear chirp in the form of confluent hypergeometric functions is analyzed in the asymptotic limit of long grating. Simple formulas for reflection coefficient and group delay are derived. The simplification makes it possible to analyze irregularities of the curves and suggest the ways of their suppression. It is shown that the increase in chirp at fixed other parameters decreases the oscillations in the group delay, but gains the oscillations in the reflection spectrum. The conclusions are in agreement with numerical calculations.
physics.optics:We report the first experimental evidence that electromagnetic coupling between physically separated planar metal patterns located in parallel planes provides for exceptionally strong polarization rotatory power if one pattern is twisted in respect to the other, creating a 3D chiral object. In terms of optical rotary power per sample of thickness equal to one wavelength, the bi-layered structure rotates five orders of magnitude stronger than a gyrotropic crystal of quartz in the visible spectrum. We also saw a signature of negative refraction for circularly polarized waves propagating through the chiral slab.
physics.optics:The light propagation through one-dimensional photonic crystal using Four-wave mixing (FWM) nonlinear process is modeled. The linear and nonlinear indexes of refraction are approximated with the first Fourier harmonic term. Based on this approximation, a complete set of coupled wave equations, including pump fields depletion, for description of FWM process and conversion efficiency from pump to signal and idler waves for periodic structures is presented. The derived coupled wave equations are evaluated numerically. Some of important system parameters effects on FWM performance are investigated. The obtained relations are suitable and can easily be applied for description of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical signals transmitted through (parametric process) nonlinear fiber Bragg Gratings compatible to optical fiber communications.
physics.optics:We demonstrate the association of two-photon nonlinear microscopy with balanced homodyne detection for investigating second harmonic radiation properties at nanoscale dimensions. Variation of the relative phase between second-harmonic and fundamental beams is retrieved, as a function of the absolute orientation of the nonlinear emitters. Sensitivity down to approximately 3.2 photon/s in the spatio-temporal mode of the local oscillator is obtained. This value is high enough to efficiently detect the coherent second-harmonic emission from a single KTiOPO4 crystal of sub-wavelength size.
physics.optics:The total scattering and the extinction efficiencies of a nihility cylinder of infinite length and circular cross--section are identical and independent of the polarization state of a normally incident plane wave.
physics.optics:On interrogation by a plane wave, the back-scattering efficiency of a nihility sphere is identically zero, and its extinction and forward-scattering efficiencies are higher than those of a perfectly conducting sphere.
physics.optics:We study light transmission through a homeotropically oriented nematic liquid crystal cell and solve self-consistently a nonlinear equation for the nematic director coupled to Maxwell's equations. We demonstrate that above a certain threshold of the input light intensity, the liquid-crystal cell changes abruptly its optical properties due to the light-induced Freedericksz transition, demonstrating multistable hysteresis-like dependencies in the transmission. We suggest that these properties can be employed for tunable all-optical switching photonic devices based on liquid crystals.
physics.optics:We derive coupled propagation equations for ultrashort pulses in a degenerate three-wave mixing process in quadratic media, using approximations consistent with the slowly evolving wave approximation [T. Brabec and F. Krausz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 3282 (1997)]. From these we derive an approximate single-field equation for the fundamental field. This document expands upon mathematics used for work submitted by the same authors to Physical Review Letters.
physics.optics:We describe a method to probe the spectral fluctuations of a transition over broad ranges of frequencies and timescales with the high spectral resolution of Fourier spectroscopy, and a temporal resolution as high as the excited state lifetime, even in the limit of very low photocounting rates. The method derives from a simple relation between the fluorescence spectral dynamics of a single radiating dipole and its fluorescence intensity correlations at the outputs of a continuously scanning Michelson interferometer. These findings define an approach to investigate the fast fluorescence spectral dynamics of single molecules and other faint light sources beyond the time-resolution capabilities of standard spectroscopy experiments.
physics.optics:A method to reduce the transit time of majority of carriers in photomixers and photo detectors to $< 1$ ps is proposed. Enhanced optical fields associated with surface plasmon polaritons, coupled with velocity overshoot phenomenon results in net decrease of transit time of carriers. As an example, model calculations demonstrating $> 280\times$ (or $\sim$2800 and 31.8 $\mu$W at 1 and 5 THz respectively) improvement in THz power generation efficiency of a photomixer based on Low Temperature grown GaAs are presented. Due to minimal dependence on the carrier recombination time, it is anticipated that the proposed method paves the way for enhancing the speed and efficiency of photomixers and detectors covering UV to far infrared communications wavelengths (300 to 1600 nm).
physics.optics:The injection of a beam of free 50 keV electrons into an unstructured gold surface creates a highly localized source of traveling surface plasmons with spectrum centered around 1.8 eV. The plasmons were detected by a controlled decoupling into light with a grating at a distance from the excitation point. The dominant contribution to the plasmon generation appears to come from the recombination of d-band holes created by the electron beam excitation.
physics.optics:The standard description of material media in electromagnetism is based on multipoles. It is well known that these moments depend on the point of reference chosen, except for the lowest order. It is shown that this "origin dependence" is not unphysical as has been claimed in the literature but forms only part of the effect of moving the point of reference. When also the complementary part is taken into account then different points of reference lead to different but equivalent descriptions of the same physical reality. This is shown at the microscopic as well as at the macroscopic level. A similar interpretation is valid regarding the "origin dependence" of the reflection coefficients for reflection on a semi infinite medium. We show that the "transformation theory" which has been proposed to remedy this situation (and which is thus not needed) is unphysical since the transformation considered does not leave the boundary conditions invariant.
physics.optics:We study dynamical reshaping of polychromatic beams due to collective nonlinear self-action of multiple-frequency components in periodic photonic lattices and predict the formation of polychromatic discrete solitons facilitated by localization of light in spectral gaps. We show that the self-trapping efficiency and structure of emerging polychromatic gap solitons depends on the spectrum of input beams due to the lattice-enhanced dispersion, including the effect of crossover from localization to diffraction in media with defocusing nonlinearity.
physics.optics:We report the first experiential observation and theoretical analysis of the new phenomenon of planar chiral circular conversion dichroism, which in some aspects resembles the Faraday effect in magnetized media, but does not require the presence of a magnetic field for its observation. It results from the interaction of an electromagnetic wave with a planar chiral structure patterned on the sub-wavelength scale, and manifests itself in asymmetric transmission of circularly polarized waves in the opposite directions through the structure and elliptically polarized eigenstates. The new effect is radically different from conventional gyrotropy of three-dimensional chiral media.
physics.optics:A widespread, intuitive and computationally inexpensive method to analyze light guidance through waveguide bends is by introducing an equivalent straight waveguide with refractive index profile modified to account for actual waveguide bend. Here we revise the commonly used equivalent-index formula, ending up with its simple extension that enables rigorous treatment of one- and two-dimensionally confined, uniformly bent waveguides, including tightly coiled microstructure fibers, curved ridge waveguides and ring microresonators. We also show that such technique is applicable only to waveguides composed of isotropic or uniaxially anisotropic materials, with anisotropy axis directed perpendicular to the curvature plane.
physics.optics:We have observed enhanced transmission of light through a gold film due to excitation of standing surface plasmon Bloch waves in a surface Fabry-Perot resonator. Our experimental results strongly contradict the recently suggested model of light transmission via excitation of a composite diffractive evanescent wave.
physics.optics:In this paper, a spatially dispersive finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to model wire media is developed and validated. Sub-wavelength imaging properties of the finite wire medium slabs are examined. It is demonstrated that the slab with its thickness equal to an integer number of half-wavelengths is capable of transporting images with sub-wavelength resolution from one interface of the slab to another. It is also shown that the operation of such transmission devices is not sensitive to their transverse dimensions, which can be made even comparable to the wavelength. In this case, the edge diffractions are negligible and do not disturb the image formation.
physics.optics:We show that the optical transients recently read as "Sommerfeld-Brillouin precursors" by Jeong, Dawes and Gauthier are not identifiable with optical precursors (unless one considers that any coherent transient propagating in a dilute medium at the velocity c is an optical precursor) and that they can be interpreted in very simple physical terms.
physics.optics:This letter describes the design and operation of a polymer-based third order distributed feed-back (DFB) microfluidic dye laser. The device relies on light-confinement in a nano-structured polymer film where an array of nanofluidic channels is filled by capillary action with a liquid dye solution which has a refractive index lower than that of the polymer. In combination with a third order DFB grating, formed by the array of nanofluidic channels, this yields a low threshold for lasing. The laser is straight-forward to integrate on Lab-on-a-Chip micro-systems where coherent, tunable light in the visible range is desired.
physics.optics:A class of multiwavelength Fabry-Perot lasers is introduced where the spectrum is tailored through a non-periodic patterning of the cavity effective index. The cavity geometry is obtained using an inverse scattering approach and can be designed such that the spacing of discrete Fabry-Perot lasing modes is limited only by the bandwidth of the inverted gain medium. A specific two-color semiconductor laser with a mode spacing in the THz regime is designed, and measurements are presented demonstrating the simultaneous oscillation of the two wavelengths. The extension of the Fabry-Perot laser concept described presents significant new possibilities in laser cavity design.
physics.optics:Using a generalized Gaussian beam decomposition method we determine the propagation of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam that has passed through a thin nonlinear optical Kerr medium. The orbital angular momentum per photon of the beam is found to be conserved while the component beams change. As an illustration of applications, we propose and demonstrate a z-scan experiment using an $LG_0^1$ beam and a dye-doped polymer film.
physics.optics:We present a comparative overview of existing laser beam profiling methods. We compare the the knife-edge, scanning slit, and pin-hole methods. Data is presented in a comparative fashion. We also elaborate on the use of CCD profiling methods and present appropriate imagery. These methods allow for a quantitative determination of transverse laser beam-profiles using inexpensive and accessible methods. The profiling techniques presented are inexpensive and easily applicable to a variety of experiments.
physics.optics:Continuous-wave Raman amplification in silicon waveguides with negative electrical power dissipation is reported. It is shown that a p-n junction can simultaneously achieve carrier sweep-out leading to net continuous-wave gain, and electrical power generation. The approach is also applicable to silicon Raman lasers and other third-order nonlinear optical devices.
physics.optics:Formation of a novel hybrid-vector spatial plasmon-soliton in a Kerr slab embedded in-between metal plates is predicted and analyzed with a modified NLSE, encompassing hybrid vector field characteristics. Assisted by the transverse plasmonic effect, the self trapping dimension of the plasmon-soliton was substantially compressed (compared to the dielectrically cladded slab case) when reducing the slab width. The practical limitation of the Plasmon-soliton size reduction is determined by available nonlinear materials and metal loss. For the extreme reported values of nonlinear index change, we predict soliton with a cross section of 300nm x 30nm (average dimension of 100nm).
physics.optics:Modal volumes at the nano-scale, much smaller than the "diffraction-limit", with appreciable quality factors, are calculated for a dielectric cavity embedded in a space between metal plates. The modal field is bounded between the metal interfaces in one dimension and can be reduced in size almost indefinitely in this dimension. But more surprisingly, due to the "plasmonic" slow wave effect, this reduction is accompanied by a similar in-plane modal size reduction. Another interesting result is that higher order cavity modes exhibit lower radiation loss. The scheme is studied with effective index analysis, and validated by FDTD simulations.
physics.optics:We analyze the resonant linear and nonlinear transmission through a photonic crystal waveguide side-coupled to a Kerr-nonlinear photonic crystal resonator. Firstly, we extend the standard coupled-mode theory analysis to photonic crystal structures and obtain explicit analytical expressions for the bistability thresholds and transmission coefficients which provide the basis for a detailed understanding of the possibilities associated with these structures. Next, we discuss limitations of standard coupled-mode theory and present an alternative analytical approach based on the effective discrete equations derived using a Green's function method. We find that the discrete nature of the photonic crystal waveguides allows a novel, geometry-driven enhancement of nonlinear effects by shifting the resonator location relative to the waveguide, thus providing an additional control of resonant waveguide transmission and Fano resonances. We further demonstrate that this enhancement may result in the lowering of the bistability threshold and switching power of nonlinear devices by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we show that employing such enhancements is of paramount importance for the design of all-optical devices based on slow-light photonic crystal waveguides.
physics.optics:We present the first observation, to our knowledge, of lasing from a levitated, dye droplet. The levitated droplets are created by computer controlled pico-liter dispensing into one of the nodes of a standing ultrasonic wave (100 kHz), where the droplet is trapped. The free hanging droplet forms a high quality optical resonator. Our 750 nL lasing droplets consist of Rhodamine 6G dissolved in ethylene glycol, at a concentration of 0.02 M. The droplets are optically pumped at 532 nm light from a pulsed, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser, and the dye laser emission is analyzed by a fixed grating spectrometer. With this setup we have achieved reproducible lasing spectra in the visible wavelength range from 610 nm to 650 nm. The levitated droplet technique has previously successfully been applied for a variety of bio-analytical applications at single cell level. In combination with the lasing droplets, the capability of this high precision setup has potential applications within highly sensitive intra-cavity absorbance detection.
physics.optics:The propagation of electromagnetic waves in the anisotropic medium with a single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation is investigated. It is found that in such an anisotropic medium E- and H-polarized waves have the same dispersion relation, while E- and H-polarized waves exhibit opposite amphoteric refraction characteristics. E- (or H-) polarized waves are positively refracted whereas H- (or E-) polarized waves are negatively refracted at the interface associated with the anisotropic medium. By suitably using the properties of anomalous refraction in the anisotropic medium it is possible to realize a very simple and very efficient beam splitter to route the light. It is shown that the splitting angle and the splitting distance between E- and H- polarized beam is the function of anisotropic parameters, incident angle and slab thickness.
physics.optics:A composite material comprising randomly distributed spherical particles of two different isotropic dielectric-magnetic materials is homogenized using the second-order strong-property-fluctuation theory in the long-wavelength approximation. Whereas neither of the two constituent materials by itself supports planewave propagation with negative phase velocity (NPV), the homogenized composite material (HCM) can. The propensity of the HCM to support NPV propagation is sensitive to the distributional statistics of the constituent material particles, as characterized by a two--point covariance function and its associated correlation length. The scope for NPV propagation diminishes as the correlation length increases.
physics.optics:We study the electromagnetic surface waves localized at an interface separating a one-dimensional photonic crystal and left-handed metamaterial, the so-called surface Tamm states. We demonstrate that the metamaterial allows for a flexible control of the dispersion properties of surface states, and can support the Tamm states with a backward energy flow and a vortex-like structure.
physics.optics:We investigate the wave propagation in the anisotropic metamaterial with single-sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation. Based on boundary conditions and dispersion relations, we find that the opposite amphoteric refraction, such that E- (or H-) polarized waves are positively refracted whereas H- (or E-) polarized waves are negatively refracted, can occur at the interface associated with the anisotropic metamaterial. Under a certain condition, both E- and H-polarized waves can exhibit the same single-sheeted hyperboloid or straight dispersion relation, while the two polarized waves exhibit different propagation characteristics. We expect some potential device applications can be derived based on based on the unique amphoteric refraction properties.
physics.optics:In this paper, we numerically demonstrate a near-infrared negative-index metamaterial (NIM) slab consisting of multiple layers of perforated metal-dielectric stacks and exhibiting low imaginary part of index over the wavelength of negative refraction. The effective index is obtained using two different numerical methods and found to be consistent. Backward phase propagation is verified by calculation of fields inside the metamaterial. These results point to a new design of low loss thick metamaterial at optical frequencies.
physics.optics:The seamless transition between micro-scale photonics and nano-scale plasmonics requires the mitigation between different waveguiding mechanisms as well as between few orders of magnitude in the field lateral size, down to a small fraction of a wavelength. By exploiting gap plasmon polariton waves both at the micro and nano scale, very high power transfer efficiency (>60%) can be achieved using an ultrashort (few microns) non adiabatic tapered gap plasmon waveguide. Same mechanism may be used to harvest impinging light waves and direct them into a nano hole or slit, to exhibit an anomalous transmission - without the conventional periodic structures. The special interplay of plasmonic and oscillating modes is analyzed.
physics.optics:We demonstrate how to control independently both spatial and temporal dynamics of slow light. We reveal that specially designed nonlinear waveguide arrays with phase-shifted Bragg gratings demonstrate the frequency-independent spatial diffraction near the edge of the photonic bandgap, where the group velocity of light can be strongly reduced. We show in numerical simulations that such structures allow a great flexibility in designing and controlling dispersion characteristics, and open a way for efficient spatiotemporal self-trapping and the formation of slow-light optical bullets.
physics.optics:Theoretical investigations of dynamical behavior in optical parametric oscillators (OPO) have generally assumed that the cavity detunings of the interacting fields are controllable parameters. However, OPOs are known to experience mode hops, where the system jumps to the mode of lowest cavity detuning. We note that this phenomenon significantly limits the range of accessible detunings and thus may prevent instabilities predicted to occur above a minimum detuning from being evidenced experimentally. As a simple example among a number of instability mechanisms possibly affected by this limitation, we discuss the Hopf bifurcation leading to periodic behavior in the monomode mean-field model of a triply resonant OPO and show that it probably can be observed only in very specific setups.
physics.optics:The race to engineering metamaterials comprising of a negative refractive index in the optical range has been fueled by the realization of negative index materials for GHz frequencies six years ago. Sheer miniaturization of the GHz resonant structures is one approach. Alternative designs make use of localized plasmon resonant metal nanoparticles or nanoholes in metal films. Following this approach, a negative refractive index has been realized in the optical range very recently. We review these recent results and summarize how to unambiguously retrieve the effective refractive index of thin layers from data accessible to measurements. Numerical simulations show that a composite material comprising of silver strips and a gain providing material can have a negative refractive index of -1.3 and 100% transmission, simultaneously.
physics.optics:We present a theoretical formulation of competition among electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Raman processes. The latter become important when the medium can no longer be considered to be dilute. Unlike the standard formulation of EIT, we consider all fields applied and generated as interacting with both the transitions of the $\Lambda$ scheme. We solve Maxwell equations for the net generated field using a fast-Fourier-transform technique and obtain predictions for the probe, control and Raman fields. We show how the intensity of the probe field is depleted at higher atomic number densities due to the build up of multiple Raman fields.
physics.optics:We develop an amended ray optics description for reflection at the curved dielectric interfaces of optical microresonators which improves the agreement with wave optics by about one order of magnitude. The corrections are separated into two contributions of similar magnitude, corresponding to ray displacement in independent quantum phase space directions, which can be identified with Fresnel filtering and the Goos-Haenchen shift, respectively. Hence we unify two effects which only have been studied separately in the past.
physics.optics:An analytical description of arbitrary strongly aberrated axially symmetric focusing is developed. This is done by matching the solution of geometrical optics with a wave pattern which is universal for the underlying ray structure. The corresponding canonical integral is the Bessoid integral, which is a three dimensional generalization of the Pearcey integral that approximates the field near an arbitrary two-dimensional cusp. We first develop the description for scalar fields and then generalize it to the vector case. As a practical example the formalism is applied to the focusing of light by transparent dielectric spheres with a few wavelengths in diameter. The results demonstrate good agreement with the Mie theory down to Mie parameters of about 30. Compact analytical expressions are derived for the intensity on the axis and the position of the diffraction focus both for the general case and for the focusing by microspheres. The high intensity region is narrower than for an ideal lens of the same aperture at the expense of longitudinal localization and has a polarization dependent fine structure, which can be explained quantitatively. The results are relevant for aerosol and colloid science where natural light focusing occurs and can be used in laser micro- and nano-processing of materials.
physics.optics:We demonstrate a novel convenient nondestructive method based on optical parametric amplification that allows retrieval of the zero-dispersion wavelength map along a short optical fiber span with a high-spatial resolution. The improved resolution relies on the high sensitivity to the local longitudinal dispersion fluctuations of the parametric high-gain spectrum.
physics.optics:When a circularly polarized plane wave is normally incident on a slab of a structurally chiral material with local $\bar{4}2m$ point group symmetry and a central twist defect, the slab can function as either a narrowband reflection hole filter for co-handed plane waves or an ultranarrowband transmission hole filter for cross-handed plane waves, depending on its thickness and the magnitude of the applied dc electric field. Exploitation of the Pockels effect significantly reduces the thickness of the slab.
physics.optics:Horizontal resonances of slit arrays are studied. They can lead to an enhanced transmission that cannot be explained using the single-mode approximation. A new type of cavity resonance is found when the slits are narrow for a wavelength very close to the period. It can be excited for very low thicknesses. Optimization shows these structures could constitute interesting monochromatic filters.
physics.optics:It is found that the amphoteric refraction, i.e. the refraction can be either positive or negative depending on the incident angles, could occur at a planar interface associated with a uniaxially anisotropic positive index media (PIM) or an anisotropic negative index media (NIM). Particularly, the anomalous negative refraction can occur at a planar interface from an isotropic PIM to an anisotropic PIM, whereas the anomalous positive refraction occurs at the interface from an isotropic PIM to an anisotropic NIM. The optimal conditions to yield the two unusual refractions are obtained. The difference of the two types of amphoteric refraction is discussed.
physics.optics:We show that a Rubidium vapor can be produced within the core of a photonic band-gap fiber yielding an optical depth in excess of 2000. Our technique for producing the vapor is based on coating the inner walls of the fiber core with an organosilane and using light-induced atomic desorption to release Rb atoms into the core. We develop a model to describe the dynamics of the atomic density, and as an initial demonstration of the potential of this system for supporting ultra-low-level nonlinear optical interactions, we perform electromagnetically-induced transparency with control-field powers in the nanowatt regime, which represents more than a 1000-fold reduction from the power required for bulk, focused geometries.
physics.optics:We consider layered heterostructures combining ordinary positive index materials and dispersive metamaterials. We show that these structures can exhibit a new type of photonic gap around frequencies where either the magnetic permeability \mu or the electric permittivity \epsilon of the metamaterial is zero. Although the interface of a semi-infinite medium with zero refractive index (a condition attained either when \mu= 0 or when \epsilon= 0) is known to give full reflectivity for all incident polarizations, here we show that a gap corresponding to \mu = 0 occurs only for TE polarized waves, whereas a gap corresponding to \epsilon = 0 occurs only for TM polarized waves. These band gaps are scale-length invariant and very robust against disorder, although they may disappear for the particular case of propagation along the stratification direction.
physics.optics:Here we demonstrate that photons launched into a specially designed metamaterial waveguide act as massive quasi-particles, which experience strong acceleration. Laser light propagating through such a waveguide may be used as a thermometer which would measure the Unruh temperature. Moreover, the metamaterial waveguide design may be approximated by a tapered optical waveguide.
physics.optics:We investigate the effects of delayed Raman response on pulse dynamics in massive multichannel optical fiber communication systems. Taking into account the stochastic nature of pulse sequences in different frequency channels and the Raman induced energy exchange in pulse collisions we show that the pulse parameters exhibit intermittent dynamic behavior, and that the pulse amplitudes exhibit relatively strong and long-range correlations. Moreover, we find that the Raman-induced cross frequency shift is the main intermittency-related mechanism leading to bit pattern deterioration and evaluate the bit-error-rate of the system.
physics.optics:Model of partially coherent pulses, based on the concept of "hidden coherence", introduced recently by Picozzi and Haelterman in framework of parametric wave mixing, is presented. The nonuiform and nonstationary phase shift, while completely deterministic, results in the beam properties, which are typical for partially coherent light - low contrast of interference effects, increase of spectral width and so on - i. e. light becomes effectively non-coherent. The proposed model is studied in framework of coherent mode decomposition, its main properties and limitations of the model are discussed.
physics.optics:Negative refraction is known to occur in materials that simultaneously possess a negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability; hence they are termed negative index materials. However, there are no known natural materials that exhibit a negative index of refraction. In large part, interest in these materials is due to speculation that they could be used as perfect lenses with superresolution. We propose a new way of achieving negative refraction with currently available technology, based on transparent, metallo-dielectric multilayer structures. The advantage of these structures is that both tunability and transmission (well above 50%) can be achieved in the visible wavelength regime. We demonstrate both negative refraction and superresolution in these structures. Our findings point to a simpler way to fabricate a material that exhibits negative refraction. This opens up an entirely new path not only for negative refraction, but also to expand the exploration of wave propagation effects in metals.
physics.optics:We present detailed experimental and numerical studies of random lasing in weakly scattering systems. The interference of scattered light, which is weak in the passive systems, is greatly enhanced in the presence of high gain, providing coherent and resonant feedback for lasing. The lasing modes are confined in the vicinity of the pumped volume due to absorption of emitted light outside it. In the ballistic regime where the size of gain volume is less than the scattering mean free path, lasing oscillation occurs along the direction in which the gain volume is most extended, producing directional laser output. The feedback for lasing originates mainly from backscattering of particles near the boundaries of pumped region. It results in nearly constant frequency spacing of lasing modes, which scales inversely with the maximum dimension of the gain volume.
physics.optics:We model the process of ultra broadband light generation in which a pair of laser pulses separated by the Raman frequency drive a Raman transition. In contrast to the usual approach using separate field envelopes for the different frequency components, we treat the field as a single entity. This requires the inclusion of few-cycle corrections to the pulse propagation. Our single-field model makes fewer approximations and is mathematically (and hence computationally) simpler, although it does require greater computational resources to implement. The single-field theory reduces to the traditional multi-field one using appropriate approximations.
physics.optics:I present a detailed derivation of wideband optical pulses interacting with a Raman transition in the kind of scheme currently used to generate the ultra broadband light fields needed to create ultrashort pulses. In contrast to the usual approach using separate field envelopes for the pump, Stokes, and anti-Stokes spectral lines, I use a single field envelope. This requires the inclusion of few-cycle corrections to the pulse propagation. The single-field model makes fewer approximations and is mathematically (and hence computationally) simpler, although it does require greater computational resources to implement. The single-field theory reduces to the traditional multi-field one using appropriate approximations.
physics.optics:The absorption and extinction spectra of sub-wavelength cylinder arrays are shown to present two different kind of resonances. Close to the Rayleigh anomalies, the diffractive coupling with the lattice periodicity leads to sharp peaks in the extinction spectra with characteristic Fano line shapes for both s and p-polarizations. When the material exhibits an absorption line or in the presence of localized surface plasmon/polaritons, the system is shown to present resonant absorption with wider and symmetric line shapes. For s-polarization our analysis predicts a theoretical limit of 50 % of absorption. Interestingly, for p-polarized light and an appropriate choice of parameters, subwavelength cylinder arrays can present perfect (100 %) absorption.
physics.optics:We present simulation results of a design for negative index materials that uses magnetic resonators to provide negative permeability and metal film for negative permittivity. We also discuss the possibility of using semicontinuous metal films to achieve better manufacturability and enhanced impedance matching.
physics.optics:A medium which is an isotropic chiral medium from the perspective of a co-moving observer is a Faraday chiral medium (FCM) from the perspective of a non-co-moving observer. The Tellegen constitutive relations for this FCM are established. By an extension of the Beltrami field concept, these constitutive relations are exploited to show that planewave propagation is characterized by four generally independent wavenumbers. This FCM can support negative phase velocity at certain translational velocities and with certain wavevectors, even though the corresponding isotropic chiral medium does not. The constitutive relations and Beltrami--like fields are also used to develop a convenient spectral representation of the dyadic Green functions for the FCM.
physics.optics:Silicon and germanium are perhaps the two most well-understood semiconductor materials in the context of solid state device technologies and more recently micromachining and nanotechnology. Meanwhile, these two materials are also important in the field of infrared lens design. Optical instruments designed for the wavelength range where these two materials are transmissive achieve best performance when cooled to cryogenic temperatures to enhance signal from the scene over instrument background radiation. In order to enable high quality lens designs using silicon and germanium at cryogenic temperatures, we have measured the absolute refractive index of multiple prisms of these two materials using the Cryogenic, High-Accuracy Refraction Measuring System (CHARMS) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, as a function of both wavelength and temperature. For silicon, we report absolute refractive index and thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K at wavelengths from 1.1 to 5.6 microns, while for germanium, we cover temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K and wavelengths from 1.9 to 5.5 microns. We compare our measurements with others in the literature and provide temperature-dependent Sellmeier coefficients based on our data to allow accurate interpolation of index to other wavelengths and temperatures. Citing the wide variety of values for the refractive indices of these two materials found in the literature, we reiterate the importance of measuring the refractive index of a sample from the same batch of raw material from which final optical components are cut when absolute accuracy greater than +/-5 x 10^-3 is desired.
physics.optics:Optical plasmon-polariton modes confined in both transverse dimensions to significantly less than a wavelength are exhibited in open waveguides structured as sharp metal wedges. The analysis reveals two distinctive modes corresponding to a localized mode on the wedge point and surface mode propagation on the abruptly bent interface. These predictions are accompanied by unique field distributions and dispersion characteristics.
physics.optics:We study propagation of two lowest order Gaussian laser beams with different wavelengths in weak atmospheric turbulence. Using the Rytov approximation and assuming a slow detector we calculate the longitudinal and radial components of the scintillation index for a typical free space laser communication setup. We find the optimal configuration of the two laser beams with respect to the longitudinal scintillation index. We show that the value of the longitudinal scintillation for the optimal two-beam configuration is smaller by more than 50% compared with the value for a single lowest order Gaussian beam with the same total power. Furthermore, the radial scintillation for the optimal two-beam system is smaller by 35%-40% compared with the radial scintillation in the single beam case. Further insight into the reduction of intensity fluctuations is gained by analyzing the self- and cross-intensity contributions to the scintillation index.
physics.optics:A study of band edge phenomena in ridge waveguide magnetophotonic crystals is presented. Normal mode analysis is used to examine the near-band edge and Bragg center-wavelength group velocities and their relation to the polarization. Large polarization departures from the input are observed in Bragg gratings patterned by focused-ion-beam milling on liquid-phase-epitaxial (LPE) BiLuIG films on (111) gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates. Transfer matrix analysis of the spectral response in the photonic crystals allows the determination of the phase of the elliptically polarized normal modes from measured transmittances and polarization rotation. Unlike non-birefringent Faraday rotators a non-linear-relation exists between polarization rotation and the normal mode phase difference. Large phase differences between right- and left-elliptically polarized normal modes and optical slow-down are found near the band edges and at the resonant cavity center-wavelength. Standing-wave photon trapping and optical slow-down are analyzed and compared for these systems.
physics.optics:Inter-modal coupling in photonic bandgap optical channels in magnetic films is used to leverage the transverse-electric (TE) to transverse-magnetic (TM) mode conversion due to the Faraday Effect. The underlying mechanism is traced to the dependence of the grating coupling-constant on the modal refractive index and the mode profile of the propagating beam, a feature that arises in waveguide propagation and is not present in normal-incidence stack magnetophotonic crystals. Large changes in polarization near the band edges are observed in first and second orders as a result of the photonic bandgap structure. Extreme sensitivity to linear birefringence exists in second order.
physics.optics:This work reports single-frequency laser oscillation at 1003.4 nm of an optically pumped external cavity semiconductor laser. By using a gain structure bonded onto a high conductivity substrate, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally the strong reduction of the thermal resistance of the active semiconductor medium, resulting in a high power laser emission. The spectro-temporal dynamics of the laser is also explained. Furthermore, an intracavity frequency-doubling crystal was used to obtain a stable single-mode generation of blue (501.5 nm) with an output power around 60 mW.
physics.optics:We explore the role of laser induced anti-alignment in enhancing molecular orientation. A field-free enhanced orientation via anti-alignment scheme is presented, which combines a linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulse with a half-cycle pulse. The laser pulse induces transient anti-alignment in the plane orthogonal to the field polarization, while the half-cycle pulse leads to the orientation. We identify two qualitatively different enhancement mechanisms depending on the pulse order, and optimize their effects using classical and quantum models both at zero and non-zero temperature.
physics.optics:We study surface states of 1D photonic crystals using a semiclassical coupled wave theory. Both TE and TM modes are treated. We derive analytic approximations that clarify the systematics of the dispersion relations, and the roles of the various parameters defining the crystal.
physics.optics:A 2D transparency may be projected on a diffractive screen by just illuminating it with a filament lamp of the same height. Sharpness of the filament width is naturally related to sharpness on the image, but some peculiar properties makes this experience to be different from a shadow projection case.
physics.optics:Although Gigahertz-scale free-carrier modulators have been previously demonstrated in silicon, intensity modulators operating at Terahertz speeds have not been reported because of silicon's weak ultrafast optical nonlinearity. We have demonstrated intensity modulation of light with light in a silicon-polymer integrated waveguide device, based on the all-optical Kerr effect - the same ultrafast effect used in four-wave mixing. Direct measurements of time-domain intensity modulation are made at speeds of 10 GHz. We showed experimentally that the ultrafast mechanism of this modulation functions at the optical frequency through spectral measurements, and that intensity modulation at frequencies in excess of 1 THz can be obtained in this device. By integrating optical polymers through evanescent coupling to high-mode-confinement silicon waveguides, we greatly increase the effective nonlinearity of the waveguide for cross-phase modulation. The combination of high mode confinement, multiple integrated optical components, and high nonlinearities produces all-optical ultrafast devices operating at continuous-wave power levels compatible with telecommunication systems. Although far from commercial radio frequency optical modulator standards in terms of extinction, these devices are a first step in development of large-scale integrated ultrafast optical logic in silicon, and are two orders of magnitude faster than previously reported silicon devices.
physics.optics:The Sagnac effect in two dimensional (2D) resonant microcavities is studied theoretically and numerically. The frequency shift due to the Sagnac effect occurs as a threshold phenomenon for the angular velocity in a rotating microcavity. Above the threshold, the eigenfunctions of a rotating microcavity become rotating waves while they are standing waves below the threshold.
physics.optics:The interaction between two parallel beams in one-dimensional discrete saturable systems has been investigated using lithium niobate nonlinear waveguide arrays. When the beams are separated by one channel and in-phase it is possible to observe soliton fusion at low power levels. This new result is confirmed numerically. By increasing the power, soliton-like propagation of weakly-coupled beams occurs. When the beams are out-of-phase the most interesting result is the existence of oscillations which resemble the recently discovered Tamm oscillations.
physics.optics:We study propagation of TM- and TE-polarized light in two-dimensional arrays of silver nanorods of various diameters in a gelatin background. We calculate the transmittance, reflectance and absorption of arranged and disordered nanorod arrays and compare the exact numerical results with the predictions of the Maxwell-Garnett effective-medium theory. We show that interactions between nanorods, multipole contributions and formations of photonic gaps affect strongly the transmittance spectra that cannot be accounted for in terms of the conventional effective-medium theory. We also demonstrate and explain the degradation of the transmittance in arrays with randomly located rods as well as weak influence of their fluctuating diameter. For TM modes we outline the importance of skin-effect, which causes the full reflection of the incoming light. We then illustrate the possibility of using periodic arrays of nanorods as high-quality polarizers.
physics.optics:Expressions are obtained for the Wigner function moments of a paraxial light beam represented by arbitrary coherent superposition of Hermite-Gaussian beams with plane wave fronts. Possibilities are discussed for application of the obtained results to modeling real laser beams and to design of optical systems implementing prescribed transformations of a beam transverse structure.
physics.optics:We demonstrate the dynamics of stimulated Raman scattering in designed high-Q/Vm silicon photonic band gap nanocavities through the coupled-mode theory framework towards optically-pumped silicon lasing. The interplay of other chi(3) effects such as two-photon absorption and optical Kerr, related free-carrier dynamics, thermal effects, as well as linear losses such as cavity radiation and linear material absorption are included and investigated numerically. Our results clarify the relative contributions and evolution of the mechanisms, and demonstrate the lasing and shutdown thresholds. Our studies illustrate the conditions for continuous-wave and pulsed highly-efficient Raman frequency conversion to be practically realized in monolithic silicon high-Q/Vm photonic band gap defect cavities.
physics.optics:We consider group delay and broadening using two strongly absorbing and widely spaced resonances. We derive relations which show that very large pulse bandwidths coupled with large group delays and small broadening can be achieved. Unlike single resonance systems, the dispersive broadening dominates the absorptive broadening which leads to a dramatic increase in the possible group delay. We show that the double resonance systems are excellent candidates for realizing all-optical delay lines. We report on an experiment which achieved up to 50 pulse delays with 40% broadening.
physics.optics:Pseudoscopic (inverted depth) images that keep a continuous parallax were shown to be possible by use of a double diffraction process intermediated by a slit. One diffraction grating directing light to the slit acts as a wavelength encoder of views, while a second diffraction grating decodes the projected image. The process results in the enlargement of the image under common white light illumination up to infinite magnification at a critical point. We show that this point corresponds to another simple-symmetry object-observer system. Our treatment allows us to explain the experience by just dealing with main ray directions.

The process results in the enlargement of the image under common white light illumination.
physics.optics:We propose to employ the quasiisotropic metamaterial (QIMM) slab to construct a polarization insensitive lens, in which both E- and H-polarized waves exhibit the same refocusing effect. For shallow incident angles, the QIMM slab will provide some degree of refocusing in the same manner as an isotropic negative index material. The refocusing effect allows us to introduce the ideas of paraxial beam focusing and phase compensation by the QIMM slab. On the basis of angular spectrum representation, a formalism describing paraxial beams propagating through a QIMM slab is presented. Because of the negative phase velocity in the QIMM slab, the inverse Gouy phase shift and the negative Rayleigh length of paraxial Gaussian beam are proposed. We find that the phase difference caused by the Gouy phase shift in vacuum can be compensated by that caused by the inverse Gouy phase shift in the QIMM slab. If certain matching conditions are satisfied, the intensity and phase distributions at object plane can be completely reconstructed at image plane. Our simulation results show that the superlensing effect with subwavelength image resolution could be achieved in the form of a QIMM slab.
physics.optics:We report the use of an optical interference holographic setup with a five-beam configuration, consisting of four side beams and one central beam from the same half space, to fabricate woodpile and diamond structures for the use as photonic bandgap materials in which electromagnetic waves are forbidden in the bandgap. By exploiting the advantage of the binarization of the interference pattern, using intensity cut-off, either linear or circular central beam can be used. More importantly, the beam configurations can be easily implemented experimentally as compared to other configurations in which the interfering beams are counter-propagating from both half spaces.
physics.optics:The identification of the refractive index and wave vector for general (possibly active) linear, isotropic, homogeneous, and non-spatially dispersive media is discussed. Correct conditions for negative refraction necessarily include the global properties of the permittivity and permeability functions $\epsilon=\epsilon(\omega)$ and $\mu=\mu(\omega)$. On the other hand, a necessary and sufficient condition for left-handedness can be identified at a single frequency ($\re\epsilon/|\epsilon|+\re\mu/|\mu|<0$). At oblique incidence to semi-infinite, active media it is explained that the wave vector generally loses its usual interpretation for real frequencies.
physics.optics:We further miniaturize a recently established silver-based negative-index metamaterial design. By comparing transmittance, reflectance and phase-sensitive time-of-flight experiments to theory, we infer a real part of the refractive index of -0.6 at 780 nm wavelength -- which is visible in the laboratory.
physics.optics:Recently it was suggested that Hawking radiation may be observed in a nonlinear electromagnetic waveguide upon propagation of an optical pulse. We show that the spectral characteristics of the Hawking effect in such a waveguide are indistinguishable from the well-known effect of frequency broadening of an optical pulse due to self-phase modulation. Furthermore, we derive an estimate on the critical optical power at which Hawking effect is dominated by the self-phase modulation. It appears that optical experiments reported so far are clearly dominated by self-phase modulation.
physics.optics:We report the use of a (4+1)-beam optical interference holography technique to fabricate woodpile structures in photo-resists. The configuration consists of 4 linear polarized side beams arranged symmetrically around a circular polarized central beam with all the beams from the same half space, making it easily accessible experimentally. The fabricated woodpile structures are in good agreement with model simulations. Furthermore, woodpiles with the diamond symmetry are also obtained by exploiting the deformations of the photo-resists. Directional bandgaps in the visible range are also observed for the samples with and without the correct stacking of the woodpile structures.
physics.optics:We investigate slow-light via stimulated Brillouin scattering in a room temperature optical fiber that is pumped by a spectrally broadened laser. Broadening the spectrum of the pump field increases the linewidth $\Delta\omega_p$ of the Stokes amplifying resonance, thereby increasing the slow-light bandwidth. One physical bandwidth limitation occurs when the linewidth becomes several times larger than the Brillouin frequency shift $\Omega_B$ so that the anti-Stokes absorbing resonance cancels out substantially the Stokes amplifying resonance and hence the slow-light effect. We find that partial overlap of the Stokes and anti-Stokes resonances can actually lead to an enhancement of the slow-light delay - bandwidth product when $\Delta\omega_p \simeq 1.3 \Omega_B$. Using this general approach, we increase the Brillouin slow-light bandwidth to over 12 GHz from its nominal linewidth of $\sim$30 MHz obtained for monochromatic pumping. We controllably delay 75-ps-long pulses by up to 47 ps and study the data pattern dependence of the broadband SBS slow-light system.
physics.optics:We present a theoretical study of electromagnetic surface waves localized at an interface separating a conventional uniform medium and a semi-infinite 1-D photonic crystal made of alternate left-handed metamaterial and right-handed material which we refer to as left-handed photonic crystal. We find novel type of surface mode's structure, the so-called surface Tamm states and demonstrate that the presence of metamaterial in the photonic crystal structure allows for a flexible control of the dispersion properties of surface states, and can support the Tamm states with a backward energy flow and a vortex-like structure.
physics.optics:We investigate nonlinear transmission in a layered structure consisting of a slab of positive index material (PIM) with Kerr-type nonlinearity and a sub-wavelength layer of linear negative index material (NIM) sandwiched between semi-infinite linear dielectrics. We find that a thin layer of NIM leads to significant changes in the hysteresis width when the nonlinear slab is illuminated at an angle near that of total internal reflection. Unidirectional diode-like transmission with enhanced operational range is demonstrated. These results may be useful for NIMs characterization and for designing novel NIMs based devices.
physics.optics:The use of short lengths of large core phosphate glass fibre, doped with high concentrations of Er or Er:Yb represents an attractive route to achieving high power erbium doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) and lasers (EDFLs). With the aim of investigating the potential of achieving diffraction limited output from such large core fibres, we present experimental results of fundamental mode propagation through a 20 cm length of passive 300 micrometer core multimode fibre when the input is a well-aligned Gaussian beam. Through careful control of fibre geometry, input beam parameters and alignment, we measured an output M squared of 1.1 + - 0.05. The fibre had a numerical aperture of 0.389, implying a V number of 236.8. To our knowledge, this is the largest core fibre through which diffraction limited fundamental mode propagation has been demonstrated. Although the results presented here relate to undoped fibre, they do provide the practical basis for a new generation of EDFAs and EDFLs.
physics.optics:Achieving single-mode operation and highly directional (preferably unidirectional) in-plane light output from whispering-gallery (WG) mode semiconductor microdisk resonators without seriously degrading the mode Q-factor challenges designers of low-threshold microlasers. To address this problem, basic design rules to tune the spectral and emission characteristics of micro-scale optical cavity structures with nanoscale features by tailoring their geometry are formulated and discussed in this paper. The validity and usefulness of these rules is demonstrated by reviewing a number of previously studied cavity shapes with global and local deformations. The rules provide leads to novel improved WG-mode cavity designs, two of which are presented: a cross-shaped photonic molecule with introduced asymmetry and a photonic-crystal-assisted microdisk resonator. Both these designs yield degenerate mode splitting, as well as Q-factor enhancement and directional light output of one of the split modes.
astro-ph.GA:The magnetic fields of our Milky Way galaxy are the main agent for cosmic rays to transport. In the last decade, much new knowledge has been gained from measurements of the Galactic magnetic fields. In the Galactic disk, from the RMs of a large number of newly discovered pulsars, the large-scale magnetic fields along the spiral arms have been delineated in a much larger region than ever before, with alternating directions in the arm and interarm regions. The toroidal fields in the Galactic halo were revealed to have opposite directions below and above the Galactic plane, which is an indication of an A0 mode dynamo operating in the halo. The strength of large-scale fields obtained from pulsar RM data has been found to increase exponentially towards the Galactic center. Compared to the steep Kolmogorov spectrum of magnetic energy at small scales, the large-scale magnetic fields show a shallow broken spatial magnetic energy spectrum.
astro-ph.GA:We present a list of interstellar absorption lines in the direction of HD 37061 in the M 43 nebula. Some of the absorption lines arise from atomic excited levels that are uncommon in interstellar clouds. The excited levels of Fe II are populated by fluorescence. We found a large number of H2 molecular absorption lines arising from vibrationally excited levels. The ortho/para H2 ratio is equal to 2.7. The H2 rotational temperature of vibrational levels 1 - 5 exceeds 2000 K.
astro-ph.GA:We present a new multi-fluid, grid MHD code PIERNIK, which is based on the Relaxing TVD scheme (Jin & Xin, 1995). The original scheme (see Trac & Pen (2003) and Pen et al. (2003)) has been extended by an addition of dynamically independent, but interacting fluids: dust and a diffusive cosmic ray gas, described within the fluid approximation, with an option to add other fluids in an easy way. The code has been equipped with shearing-box boundary conditions, and a selfgravity module, Ohmic resistivity module, as well as other facilities which are useful in astrophysical fluid-dynamical simulations. The code is parallelized by means of the MPI library. In this paper we present an extension of PIERNIK, which is designed for simulations of diffusive propagation of the Cosmic-Ray (CR) component in the magnetized ISM.
astro-ph.GA:Aims. High angular resolution N-band imaging is used to discern the torus of active galactic nuclei (AGN) from its environment in order to allow a comparison of its mid-infrared properties to the expectations of the unified scenario for AGN. Methods. We present VLT-VISIR images of 25 low-redshift AGN of different Seyfert types, as well as N-band SEDs of 20 of them. In addition, we compare our results for 19 of them to Spitzer IRS spectra. Results. We find that at a resolution of ~ 0.35", all the nuclei of our observed sources are point-like, except for 2 objects whose extension is likely of instrumental origin. For 3 objects, however, we observed additional extended circumnuclear emission, even though our observational strategy was not designed to detect it. Comparison of the VISIR photometry and Spitzer spectrophotometry indicates that the latter is affected by extended emission in at least 7 out of 19 objects and the level of contamination is (0.20 ~ 0.85) * F_IRS. In particular, the 10 um silicate emission feature seen in the Spitzer spectra of 6 type I AGN, possibly 1 type II AGN and 2 LINERs, also probably originates not solely in the torus but also in extended regions. Conclusions. Our results generally agree with the expectations from the unified scenario, while the relative weakness of the silicate feature supports clumpy torus models. Our VISIR data indicate that, for low-redshift AGN, a large fraction of Spitzer IRS spectra are contaminated by extended emission close to the AGN.
astro-ph.GA:The dark cloud Lynds 1622 is one of a few specific sites in the Galaxy where, relative to observed free-free and vibrational dust emission, there is a clear excess of microwave emission. In order to constrain models for this microwave emission, and to better establish the contribution which it might make to ongoing and near-future microwave background polarization experiments, we have used the Green Bank Telescope to search for linear polarization at 9.65 Ghz towards Lynds 1622. We place a 95.4% upper limit of 88 micro-Kelvin (123 micro-Kelvin at 99.7 confidence) on the total linear polarization of this source averaged over a 1'.3 FWHM beam. Relative to the observed level of anomalous emission in Stokes I these limits correspond to fractional linear polarizations of 2.7% and 3.5%.
astro-ph.GA:Alignment of dust by radiative torques (RATs) has proven to be the most promising mechanism to explain alignment in various astrophysical environments, from comet atmospheres to accretion disks, molecular clouds, and diffuse interstellar gas. We discuss some of the major advances, which include, first of all, formulating of the analytical model of RATs. This model was shown to reproduce well the torques acting on actual irregular dust grains and allowed studies of the parameter space for which the alignment happens with long axes perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. Such a study resulted in an important conclusion that, without any paramagnetic relaxation, the RAT alignment always happens for interstellar grains with long axes perpendicular to the magnetic field. We show that the gaseous bombardment in some cases increases the degree of alignment by knocking out grains from the positions of imperfect alignment when the grains rotate slowly to more stable positions of perfect alignment where grains rotate fast. In terms of pinwheel torques, important revisions have been made in the Lazarian and Draine model of grain flipping and thermal trapping. Those, however, do not change the major conclusion that very small grains (i.e. grain size smaller than ~0.03 micron) should be marginally aligned. Recent work made the RAT alignment a predictive theory which is ready for quantitative modeling of astrophysical polarization. We predict that the microwave emission from the Zodiacal dust presents an important contaminant, which should be included into foreground polarization templates.
astro-ph.GA:Bulges are of different types, morphologies and kinematics, from pseudo-bulges, close to disk properties (Sersic index, rotation fraction, flatenning), to classical de Vaucouleurs bulges, close to elliptical galaxies. Secular evolution and bar development can give rise to pseudo-bulges. To ensure prolonged secular evolution, gas flows are required along the galaxy life-time. There is growing evidence for cold gas accretion around spiral galaxies. This can explain the bar cycle of destruction and reformation, together with pseudo-bulge formation. However, bulges can also be formed through major mergers, minor mergers, and massive clumps early in the galaxy evolution. Bulge formation is so efficient that it is difficult to explain the presence of bulgeless galaxies today.
astro-ph.GA:Outward radiation pressure can exceed the inward gravitational pull on gas clouds in the neighbourhood of a luminous Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). This creates a forbidden region for long-lived dusty clouds in the observed columnn density - Eddington fraction plane. (The Eddington fraction lambda_Edd is the ratio of the bolometric luminosity of an AGN to the Eddington limit for its black hole mass.) The Swift/BAT catalogue is the most complete hard X-ray selected sample of AGN and has 97 low redshift AGN with measured column densities N_H and inferred black hole masses. Eddington fractions for the sources have been obtained using recent bolometric corrections and the sources have been plotted on the N_H - lambda_Edd plane. Only one source lies in the forbidden region and it has a large value of N_H due to an ionized warm absorber, for which radiation pressure is reduced. The effective Eddington limit for the source population indicates that the high column density clouds in the more luminous objects lie within the inner few pc, where the central black hole provides at least half the mass. Our result shows that radiation pressure does affect the presence of gas clouds in the inner galaxy bulge. We discuss briefly how the N_H - lambda_Edd plane may evolve to higher redshift, when feedback due to radiation pressure may have been strong.
astro-ph.GA:We numerically evolve turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a 3D, unstratified shearing box and study its structure using two-point correlation functions. We confirm Fromang and Papaloizou's result that shearing box models with zero net magnetic flux are not converged; the dimensionless shear stress $\alpha$ is proportional to the grid scale. We find that the two-point correlation of the magnetic field shows that it is composed of narrow filaments that are swept back by differential rotation into a trailing spiral. The correlation lengths along each of the correlation function principal axes decrease monotonically with the grid scale. For mean azimuthal field models, which we argue are more relevant to astrophysical disks than the zero net field models, we find that: $\alpha$ increases weakly with increasing resolution at fixed box size; $\alpha$ increases slightly as the box size is increased; $\alpha$ increases linearly with net field strength, confirming earlier results; the two-point correlation function of the magnetic field is resolved and converged, and is composed of narrow filaments swept back by the shear; the major axis of the two-point increases slightly as the box size is increased; these results are code independent, based on a comparison of ATHENA and ZEUS runs. The velocity, density, and magnetic fields decorrelate over scales larger than $\sim H$, as do the dynamical terms in the magnetic energy evolution equations. We conclude that MHD turbulence in disks is localized, subject to the limitations imposed by the absence of vertical stratification, the use of an isothermal equation of state, finite box size, finite run time, and finite resolution
astro-ph.GA:We present the first Chandra/ACIS imaging study of the circumnuclear region of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365. The X-ray emission is resolved into point-like sources and complex, extended emission. The X-ray morphology of the extended emission shows a biconical soft X-ray emission region extending ~5 kpc in projection from the nucleus, coincident with the high excitation outflow cones seen in optical emission lines particularly to the northwest. Harder X-ray emission is detected from a kpc-diameter circumnuclear ring, coincident with the star-forming ring prominent in the Spitzer mid-infrared images; this X-ray emission is partially obscured by the central dust lane of NGC 1365. Spectral fitting of spatially separated components indicates a thermal plasma origin for the soft extended X-ray emission (kT=0.57 keV). Only a small amount of this emission can be due to photoionization by the nuclear source. Detailed comparison with [OIII]5007 observations shows the hot interstellar medium (ISM) is spatially anticorrelated with the [OIII] emitting clouds and has thermal pressures comparable to those of the [OIII] medium, suggesting that the hot ISM acts as a confining medium for the cooler photoionized clouds. The abundance ratios of the hot ISM are fully consistent with the theoretical values for enrichment from Type II supernovae, suggesting that the hot ISM is a wind from the starburst circumnuclear ring. X-ray emission from a ~450 pc long nuclear radio jet is also detected to the southeast.
astro-ph.GA:A gap in phase-space, the loss cone (LC), is opened up by a supermassive black hole (MBH) as it disrupts or accretes stars in a galactic centre. If a star enters the LC then, depending on its properties, its interaction with the MBH will either generate a luminous electromagnetic flare or give rise to gravitational radiation, both of which are expected to have directly observable consequences. A thorough understanding of loss-cone refilling mechanisms is important for the prediction of astrophysical quantities, such as rates of tidal disrupting main-sequence stars, rates of capturing compact stellar remnants and timescales of merging binary MBHs. In this thesis, we use N-body simulations to investigate how noise from accreted satellites and other substructures in a galaxy's halo can affect the LC refilling rate.   Any N-body model suffers from Poisson noise which is similar to, but much stronger than, the two-body diffusion occurring in real galaxies. To lessen this spurious Poisson noise, we apply the idea of importance sampling to develop a new scheme for constructing N-body realizations of a galaxy model, in which interesting regions of phase-space are sampled by many low-mass particles. We use multimass N-body models of galaxies with centrally-embedded MBHs to study the effects of satellite flybys on LC refilling rates. We find that although the flux of stars into the initially emptied LC is enhanced, but the fuelling rate averaged over the entire subhalos is increased by only a factor 3 over the rate one expects from the Poisson noise due the discreteness of the stellar distribution.
astro-ph.GA:The structure and potential of a complex gravitational lens is reconstructed using the perturbative method presented in Alard 2007, MNRAS, 382L, 58; Alard 2008, MNRAS, 388, 375. This lens is composed of 6 galaxies belonging to a small group. The lens inversion is reduced to the problem of reconstructing non-degenerate quantities: the 2 fields of the perturbative theory of strong gravitational lenses. Since in the perturbative theory the circular source solution is analytical, the general properties of the perturbative solution can be inferred directly from the data. As a consequence, the reconstruction of the perturbative fields is not affected by degeneracy, and finding the best solution is only a matter of numerical refinement. The local shape of the potential and density of the lens are inferred from the perturbative solution, revealing the existence of an independent dark component that does not follow light. The most likely explanation is that the particular shape of the dark halo is due to the merging of cold dark matter halos. This is a new result illustrating the structure of dark halos at the scale of galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:We present kinematic simulations of a galactic dynamo model based on the large scale differential rotation and the small scale helical fluctuations due to supernova explosions. We report for the first time direct numerical simulations of the full galactic dynamo using an unparameterized global approach. We argue that the scale of helicity injection is large enough to be directly resolved rather than parameterized. While the actual superbubble characteristics can only be approached, we show that numerical simulations yield magnetic structures which are close both to the observations and to the previous parameterized mean field models. In particular, the quadrupolar symmetry and the spiraling properties of the field are reproduced. Moreover, our simulations show that the presence of a vertical inflow plays an essential role to increase the magnetic growth rate. This observation could indicate an important role of the downward flow (possibly linked with galactic fountains) in sustaining galactic magnetic fields.
astro-ph.GA:Strong gravitational lensing is a unique tool to model with great accuracy the inner mass distribution of massive galaxy clusters. In particular, clusters with large Einstein radii provide a wealth of multiply imaged systems in the cluster core allowing to determine precisely the shape of the central dark matter profile. This paper presents a spectroscopic survey in the massive cluster Abell 1703, displaying a large Einstein radius (28" at z=2.8) and a high number of strongly-lensed systems including a central ring-like configuration. We used LRIS on Keck to target multiple images and lensed galaxy candidates, and use the measured redshifts to constrain the mass distribution of the cluster using a parametric model. The data enable us to measure accurate redshifts in good agreement with their photometric redshifts, and to update the identification of multiply imaged systems by discovering 3 new systems and a radial counter image. We also report the discovery of a remarkably bright ~3.6 L* i-band dropout at z=5.827 in our mask which is only moderately magnified by the cluster (~3.0+/-0.08). The improved parametric mass model, including 16 multiple systems with 10 spectroscopic redshifts, further constrains the cluster-scale mass distribution with a generalized NFW profile of best-fit logarithmic slope alpha=0.92+/-0.04, concentration c200=4.72+/-0.40 and scale radius rs=476+/-45 kpc. Our strong-lensing model predicts a large scale shear signal consistent with Subaru weak-lensing measurements out to 4 Mpc h^-1. Together with the fact that the strong-lensing modeling requires a single dark matter clump, this suggests that Abell 1703 is a relaxed, unimodal cluster. This unique cluster could be probed further using deep X-ray, SZ and dynamics analysis, for a detailed study of the physics in a relaxed cluster. (abridged)
astro-ph.GA:Newborn neutron stars surrounded by hyperaccreting and neutrino-cooled disks may exist in some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and/or supernovae (SNe). In this paper we further study the structure of such a neutron-star disk based on the two-region (i.e., inner & outer) disk scenario following our previous work, and calculate the neutrino annihilation luminosity from the disk in various cases. We investigate the effects of the viscosity parameter, energy parameter (measuring the neutrino cooling efficiency of the inner disk) and outflow strength on the structure of the entire disk as well as the effect of emission from the neutron star surface boundary emission on the total neutrino annihilation rate. The inner disk satisfies the entropy-conservation or the advection-dominated self-similar structure depending on the energy parameter. An outflow from the disk decreases the density and pressure but increases the thickness of the disk. Moreover, compared with the black-hole disk, the neutrino annihilation luminosity above the neutron-star disk is higher, and the neutrino emission from the boundary layer could increase the neutrino annihilation luminosity by about one order of magnitude higher than the disk without boundary emission. The neutron-star disk with the advection-dominated inner disk could produce the highest neutrino luminosity while the disk with an outflow has the lowest. Although a heavily mass-loaded outflow from the neutron star surface at early times of neutron star formation prevents the outflow material from being accelerated to a high bulk Lorentz factor, an energetic ultrarelativistic jet via neutrino annihilation can be produced above the stellar polar region at late times if the disk accretion rate and the neutrino emission luminosity from the surface boundary layer are sufficiently high.
astro-ph.GA:Gas can be used to trace the formation and evolution of galaxies as well as the impact that the nuclear activity has on the surrounding medium. For nearby compact radio sources, we have used observations of neutral hydrogen - that we detected in emission distributed over very large scales - combined with the study of the stellar population and deep optical images to investigate the history of the formation of their host galaxy and the triggering of the activity. For more distant and more powerful compact radio sources, we have used optical spectra and HI - in absorption - to investigate the presence of fast outflows that support the idea that compact radio sources are young radio loud AGN observed during the early stages of their evolution and currently shredding their natal cocoons through extreme circumnuclear outflows. We will review the most recent results obtained from these projects.
astro-ph.GA:In the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation, luminous radio galaxies mark mass assembly peaks that should contain clusters of galaxies. Observations of the z=1.53 quasar 3C270.1 with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 3.6-24 micron and with the 6.5-m MMT in the z'- and Y-bands allow detection of potential cluster members via photometric redshifts. Compared with nearby control fields, there is an excess of 11 extremely red objects (EROs) at 1.33 < z_phot < 1.73, consistent with a proto-cluster around the quasar. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 3/4 of the EROs are better fitted with passive elliptical galaxies than withdust-reddened starbursts, and of four sources well-detected on an archival HST snapshot image, all have undisturbed morphologies. However, one ERO, not covered by the HST image, is a double source with 0.8" separation on the z' image and a marginal (2sigma) 24 micron detection indicating a dust-enshrouded starburst. The EROs are more luminous than L* (H = -23.6 AB mag at z=1.5).
astro-ph.GA:We present a newly observed relation between galaxy mass and radial metallicity gradients of early-type galaxies. Our sample of 51 early-type galaxies encompasses a comprehensive mass range from dwarf to brightest cluster galaxies. The metallicity gradients are measured out to one effective radius by comparing nearly all of the Lick absorption-line indices to recent models of single stellar populations. The relation shows very different behaviour at low and high masses, with a sharp transition being seen at a mass of ~ 3.5 x 10^10 M_sun (velocity dispersion of ~140 km/s, M_B ~ -19). Low-mass galaxies form a tight relation with mass, such that metallicity gradients become shallower with decreasing mass and positive at the very low-mass end. Above the mass transition point several massive galaxies have steeper gradients, but a clear downturn is visible marked by a broad scatter. The results are interpreted in comparison with competing model predictions. We find that an early star-forming collapse could have acted as the main mechanism for the formation of low-mass galaxies, with star formation efficiency increasing with galactic mass. The high-mass downturn could be a consequence of merging and the observed larger scatter a natural result of different merger properties. These results suggest that galaxies above the mass threshold of ~ 3.5 x 10^10 M_sun might have formed initially by mergers of gas-rich disc galaxies and then subsequently evolved via dry merger events. The varying efficiency of the dissipative merger-induced starburst and feedback processes have shaped the radial metallicity gradients in these high-mass systems.
astro-ph.GA:We present the results of Spitzer IRS infrared 5-35 micron low-resolution spectroscopic energy diagnostics of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z > 0.15, classified optically as non-Seyferts. Based on the equivalent widths of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and the optical depths of silicate dust absorption features, we searched for signatures of intrinsically luminous, but optically elusive, buried AGNs in these optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs. We then combined the results with those of non-Seyfert ULIRGs at z < 0.15 and non-Seyfert galaxies with infrared luminosities L(IR) < 10^12Lsun. We found that the energetic importance of buried AGNs clearly increases with galaxy infrared luminosity, becoming suddenly discernible in ULIRGs with L(IR) > 10{12}Lsun. For ULIRGs with buried AGN signatures, a significant fraction of infrared luminosities can be accounted for by detected buried AGN and modestly-obscured (Av < 20 mag) starburst activity. The implied masses of spheroidal stellar components in galaxies for which buried AGNs become important roughly correspond to the value separating red massive and blue, less-massive galaxies in the local universe. Our results may support the widely-proposed AGN-feedback scenario as the origin of galaxy downsizing phenomena, where galaxies with currently larger stellar masses previously had higher AGN energetic contributions and star-formation-originating infrared luminosities, and have finished their major star-formation more quickly, due to stronger AGN feedback.
astro-ph.GA:We use absolutely calibrated data from the ARCADE 2 flight in July 2006 to model Galactic emission at frequencies 3, 8, and 10 GHz. The spatial structure in the data is consistent with a superposition of free-free and synchrotron emission. Emission with spatial morphology traced by the Haslam 408 MHz survey has spectral index beta_synch = -2.5 +/- 0.1, with free-free emission contributing 0.10 +/- 0.01 of the total Galactic plane emission in the lowest ARCADE 2 band at 3.15 GHz. We estimate the total Galactic emission toward the polar caps using either a simple plane-parallel model with csc|b| dependence or a model of high-latitude radio emission traced by the COBE/FIRAS map of CII emission. Both methods are consistent with a single power-law over the frequency range 22 MHz to 10 GHz, with total Galactic emission towards the north polar cap T_Gal = 0.498 +/- 0.028 K and spectral index beta = -2.55 +/- 0.03 at reference frequency 1 GHz. The well calibrated ARCADE 2 maps provide a new test for spinning dust emission, based on the integrated intensity of emission from the Galactic plane instead of cross-correlations with the thermal dust spatial morphology. The Galactic plane intensity measured by ARCADE 2 is fainter than predicted by models without spinning dust, and is consistent with spinning dust contributing 0.4 +/- 0.1 of the Galactic plane emission at 22 GHz.
astro-ph.GA:We present imaging and spectroscopic observations for six quasars at z>5.9 discovered by the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS). The CFHQS contains sub-surveys with a range of flux and area combinations to sample a wide range of quasar luminosities at z~6. The new quasars have luminosities 10 to 75 times lower than the most luminous SDSS quasars at this redshift. The least luminous quasar, CFHQS J0216-0455 at z=6.01, has absolute magnitude M_1450=-22.21, well below the likely break in the luminosity function. This quasar is not detected in a deep XMM-Newton survey showing that optical selection is still a very efficient tool for finding high redshift quasars.
astro-ph.GA:We report a search for H2O megamasers in 274 SDSS type-2 AGNs (0.3 < z < 0.83), half of which can be classified as type-2 QSOs from their [OIII] 5007 luminosity, using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. Apart from the detection of the extremely luminous water vapor megamaser SDSS J080430.99+360718.1, already reported by Barvainis & Antonucci (2005), we do not find any additional line emission. This high rate of non-detections is compared to the water maser luminosity function created from the 78 water maser galaxies known to date and its extrapolation towards the higher luminosities of "gigamasers" that we would have been able to detect given the sensitivity of our survey. The properties of the known water masers are summarized and discussed with respect to the nature of high-z type-2 AGNs and megamasers in general. In the appendix, we list 173 additional objects (mainly radio galaxies, but also QSOs and galaxies) that were observed with the GBT, the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope, or Arecibo Observatory without leading to the detection of water maser emission.
astro-ph.GA:Above redshift 6, the dominant source of neutral hydrogen in the Universe shifts from localized clumps in and around galaxies and filaments to a pervasive, diffuse component of the intergalactic medium (IGM). This transition tracks the global neutral fraction of hydrogen in the IGM and can be studied, in principle, through the redshifted 21 cm hyperfine transition line. During the last half of the reionization epoch, the mean (global) brightness temperature of the redshifted 21 cm emission is proportional to the neutral fraction, but at earlier times (10 < z < 25), the mean brightness temperature should probe the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen in the IGM. Measuring the (of order 10 mK) mean brightness temperature of the redshifted 21 cm line as a function of frequency (and hence redshift) would chart the early evolution of galaxies through the heating and ionizing of the IGM by their stellar populations. Experiments are already underway to accomplish this task or, at least, provide basic constraints on the evolution of the mean brightness temperature. We provide a brief overview of one of these projects, the Experiment to the Detect the Global EOR Signature (EDGES), and discuss prospects for future results.
astro-ph.GA:We exploit the recent observations of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in the Galactic halo and investigate the constraints on the IMF of the stellar population that left these low-mass survivors of [Fe/H]<-2.5 and the chemical evolution that they took part in. A high-mass IMF with the typical mass~10Msun and the overwhelming contribution of low-mass members of binaries to the EMP survivors are derived from the statistics of carbon-enriched EMP stars with and without the enhancement of s-process elements (Komiya et al. 2007). We first examine the analysis to confirm their results for various assumptions on the mass-ratio distribution function. As compared with the uniform distribution, the increase or decrease function of the mass ratio gives a higher- or lower-mass IMF, and a lower-mass IMF results for the independent distribution with the both members in the same IMF, but the derived ranges of typical mass differ less than by a factor of two and overlap for the extreme cases. Furthermore, we prove that the same constraints are placed on the IMF from the surface density of EMP stars estimated from the surveys and the chemical evolution consistent with the metal yields of theoretical supernova models. We then apply the derived high-mass IMF with the binary contribution to show that the observed MDF of EMP stars can be reproduced not only for the shape but also for the number of EMP stars. In particular, the scarcity of stars below [Fe/H]<-4 is naturally explained in terms of the hierarchical structure formation, and there is no indication of significant changes in the IMF for the EMP Population. The present study indicates that 3 HMP stars of [Fe/H]<-4 are the primordial stars that were born as the low-mass members of binaries before the host clouds were polluted by their own supernovae.
astro-ph.GA:The origin of S0 galaxies is discussed in the framework of early mergers in a Cold Dark Matter cosmology, and in a scenario where S0s are assumed to be former spirals stripped of gas. From an analysis of 127 early-type disk galaxies (S0-Sa), we find a clear correlation between the scale parameters of the bulge (r_eff) and the disk (h_R), a correlation which is difficult to explain if these galaxies were formed in mergers of disk galaxies. However, the stripping hypothesis, including quiescent star formation, is not sufficient to explain the origin of S0s either, because it is not compatible with our finding that S0s have a significantly smaller fraction of bars (46$\pm$6 %) than their assumed progenitors, S0/a galaxies (93$\pm$5 %) or spirals (64-69 %). Our conclusion is that even if a large majority of S0s were descendants of spiral galaxies, bars and ovals must play an important role in their evolution. The smaller fraction particularly of strong bars in S0 galaxies is compensated by a larger fraction of ovals/lenses (97$\pm$2 % compared to 82-83 % in spirals), many of which might be weakened bars. We also found massive disk-like bulges in nine of the S0 galaxies, bulges which might have formed at an early gas-rich stage of galaxy evolution.
astro-ph.GA:Statistics of the weak lensing of galaxies can be used to constrain cosmology if the galaxy shear can be estimated accurately. In general this requires accurate modelling of unlensed galaxy shapes and the point spread function (PSF). I discuss suboptimal but potentially robust methods for estimating galaxy shear by stacking images such that the stacked image distribution is closely Gaussian by the central limit theorem. The shear can then be determined by radial fitting, requiring only an accurate model of the PSF rather than also needing to model each galaxy accurately. When noise is significant asymmetric errors in the centroid must be corrected, but the method may ultimately be able to give accurate un-biased results when there is a high galaxy density with constant shear. It provides a useful baseline for more optimal methods, and a test-case for estimating biases, though the method is not directly applicable to realistic data. I test stacking methods on the simple toy simulations with constant PSF and shear provided by the GREAT08 project, on which most other existing methods perform significantly more poorly, and briefly discuss generalizations to more realistic cases. In the appendix I discuss a simple analytic galaxy population model where stacking gives optimal errors in a perfect ideal case.
astro-ph.GA:The analysis of the broad iron line profile in the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries allows us to constrain the spin parameter of the black hole. We compare the constraints on the spin value for two X-ray sources, MCG-6-30-15 and GX 339-4, with a broad iron line using present relativistic line models in XSPEC - LAOR and KYRLINE. The LAOR model has the spin value set to the extremal value a=0.9982, while the KYRLINE model enables direct fitting of the spin parameter. The spin value is constrained mainly by the lower boundary of the broad line, which depends on the inner boundary of the disc emission where the gravitational redshift is maximal. The position of the inner disc boundary is usually identified with the marginally stable orbit which is related to the spin value. In this way the LAOR model can be used to estimate the spin value. We investigate the consistency of the LAOR and KYRLINE models. We find that the spin values evaluated by both models agree within the general uncertainties when applied on the current data. However, the results are apparently distinguishable for higher quality data, such as those simulated for the International X-ray Observatory (IXO) mission. We find that the LAOR model tends to overestimate the spin value and furthermore, it has insufficient resolution which affects the correct determination of the high-energy edge of the broad line.
astro-ph.GA:We report the results of interferometric HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) observations of four luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), NGC 2623, Mrk 266, Arp 193, and NGC 1377, as a final sample of our systematic survey using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array. Our survey contains the most systematic interferometric, spatially-resolved, simultaneous HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) observations of LIRGs. Ground-based infrared spectra of these LIRGs are also presented to elucidate the nature of the energy sources at the nuclei. We derive the HCN(1-0)/HCO+(1-0) brightness-temperature ratios of these LIRGs and confirm the previously discovered trend that LIRG nuclei with luminous buried AGN signatures in infrared spectra tend to show high HCN(1-0)/HCO+(1-0) brightness-temperature ratios, as seen in AGNs, while starburst-classified LIRG nuclei in infrared spectra display small ratios, as observed in starburst-dominated galaxies. Our new results further support the argument that the HCN(1-0)/HCO+(1-0) brightness-temperature ratio can be used to observationally separate AGN-important and starburst-dominant galaxy nuclei.
astro-ph.GA:We present WHAM observations of Halpha, [N II], and [S II] in the Smith Cloud. A map of Halpha emission from the cloud shows ionized gas coincident with the brightest H I emission, but nearly-as-bright Halpha in some regions with faint H I. The ionized mass of the cloud is at least as large as the neutral mass, > 10^6 M_sun. Ionized gas in the core of the Smith Cloud has an electron temperature 6000 K < T < 16000 K. The observed ratio [N II] / Halpha = 0.39 \pm 0.09 shows that the cloud has a non-primordial nitrogen abundance, 0.1 - 1 times solar.
astro-ph.GA:We model the large kinematic data sets for the four Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites: Carina, Fornax, Sculptor and Sextans, recently published by Walker et al. The member stars are selected using a reliable dynamical interloper removal scheme tested on simulated data. Our member selection is more restrictive than the one based on metallicity indicators as it removes not only contamination due to Milky Way stars but also the unbound stars from the tidal tails. We model the cleaned data sets by adjusting the solutions of the Jeans equations to the profiles of the projected velocity dispersion and kurtosis. The data are well reproduced by models where mass follows light and the best-fitting stellar orbits are isotropic to weakly tangential, as expected from the tidal stirring scenario. The Fornax dwarf, with more than 2400 member stars, is a dSph galaxy with the most accurately determined mass to date: its 1 sigma error following from the sampling errors of the velocity moments is below 5 percent. With mass-to-light ratio of 97 solar units, Sextans seems to be the most dark matter dominated of the four dSph galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:Abreg: By combining HST/UDF imagery with kinematics from VLT/GIRAFFE we derive a physical model of distant galaxy J033245.11-274724.0 in a way similar to what can be done in the nearby Universe. Here we study the properties of a distant compact LIRGs galaxy. Given the photometric and spectro photometric accuracies, we can decompose the galaxy in sub components and correct them for reddening. The galaxy is dominated by a dust enshrouded disk revealed by UDF imagery. The disk radius is half that of the Milky Way and the galaxy have a SFR=20Mo/yr. Morphology and kinematics show that gas and stars together spiral inwards rapidly to feed the disk and the central regions. A combined system of a bar and two non rotating spiral arms regulates the material accretion, induces large sigma, with sigma larger than 100 km/s and redistributes the angular momentum (AM). The detailed physical properties resemble to the expectations from modeling a merger of two equal mass, gaseous rich galaxies, 0.5 Gyr after the merger. In its later evolution, this galaxy could become a late type galaxy which falls on the T-F relation, with an AM mostly induced by the orbital AM of the merger.
astro-ph.GA:We analyse new deep g and i-band imaging with the CFHT of 16 QSOs in the redshift range 0.9 to 1.3. The principal points of interest are the symmetry and signs of tidal effects in the QSO hosts and nearby (`companion') galaxies. The sample measures are compared with similar measures on randomly selected field galaxy samples. Asymmetry measures are made for all objects to g ~22, and magnitudes of all galaxies 2 magnitudes fainter. The QSOs are found in denser environments than the field, and are somewhat offset from the centroid of their surrounding galaxies. The QSO hosts appear more disturbed than other galaxies. While the QSO companions and field galaxies have the same average asymmetry, the distribution of asymmetry values is different. QSO companions within 15 arcsec are fainter than average field galaxies. We discuss scenarios that are consistent with these and other measured quantities.
astro-ph.GA:We present an analysis of far-infrared dust emission from diffuse cirrus clouds. This study is based on serendipitous observations at 160 microns at high galactic latitude with the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope by the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). These observations are complemented with IRIS data at 100 and 60 microns and constitute one of the most sensitive and unbiased samples of far infrared observations at small scale of diffuse interstellar clouds. Outside regions dominated by the cosmic infrared background fluctuations, we observe a substantial scatter in the 160/100 colors from cirrus emission. We compared the 160/100 color variations to 60/100 colors in the same fields and find a trend of decreasing 60/100 with increasing 160/100. This trend can not be accounted for by current dust models by changing solely the interstellar radiation field. It requires a significant change of dust properties such as grain size distribution or emissivity or a mixing of clouds in different physical conditions along the line of sight. These variations are important as a potential confusing foreground for extragalactic studies.
astro-ph.GA:Several recent studies have shown that the star cluster initial mass function (CIMF) can be well approximated by a power law, with indications for a steepening or truncation at high masses. This contribution considers the evolution of such a mass function due to cluster disruption, with emphasis on the part of the mass function that is observable in the first ~Gyr. A Schechter type function is used for the CIMF, with a power law index of -2 at low masses and an exponential truncation at M*. Cluster disruption due to the tidal field of the host galaxy and encounters with giant molecular clouds flattens the low-mass end of the mass function, but there is always a part of the `evolved Schechter function' that can be approximated by a power law with index -2. The mass range for which this holds depends on age, t, and shifts to higher masses roughly as t^0.6. Mean cluster masses derived from luminosity limited samples increase with age very similarly due to the evolutionary fading of clusters. Empirical mass functions are, therefore, approximately power laws with index -2, or slightly steeper, at all ages. The results are illustrated by an application to the star cluster population of the interacting galaxy M51, which can be well described by a model with M*=(1.9+/-0.5)x10^5 M_sun and a short (mass-dependent) disruption time destroying M* clusters in roughly a Gyr.
astro-ph.GA:Polarization carries information about the magnetic fields in interstellar clouds. The observations of polarized dust emission are used to study the role of magnetic fields in the evolution of molecular clouds and the initial phases of star-formation. We study the grain alignment with realistic simulations, assuming the radiative torques to be the main mechanism that spins the grains up. The aim is to study the efficiency of the grain alignment as a function of cloud position and to study the observable consequences of these spatial variations. Our results are based on the analysis of model clouds derived from MHD simulations. The continuum radiative transfer problem is solved with Monte Carlo methods to estimate the 3D distribution of dust emission and the radiation field strength affecting the grain alignment. We also examine the effect of grain growth in cores. We are able to reproduce the results of Cho & Lazarian using their assumptions. However, the anisotropy factor even in the 1D case is lower than their assumption of $\gamma = 0.7$, and thus we get less efficient radiative torques. Compared with our previous paper, the polarization degree vs. intensity relation is steeper because of less efficient grain alignment within dense cores. Without grain growth, the magnetic field of the cores is poorly recovered above a few $A_{\rm V}$. If grain size is doubled in the cores, the polarization of dust emission can trace the magnetic field lines possibly up to $A_{\rm V} \sim 10$ magnitudes. However, many of the prestellar cores may be too young for grain coagulation to play a major role. The inclusion of direction dependent radiative torque efficiency weakens the alignment. Even with doubled grain size, we would not expect to probe the magnetic field past a few magnitudes in $A_{\rm V}$.
astro-ph.GA:The very young open cluster (OC) NGC 2244 in the Rosette Nebula was studied with field-star-decontaminated 2MASS photometry, which shows the main-sequence (MS) stars and an abundant pre-MS (PMS) population. Fundamental and structural parameters were derived with colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), stellar radial density profiles (RDPs) and mass functions (MFs). Most previous studies centred NGC 2244 close to the bright K0V star 12 Monocerotis, which is not a cluster member. Instead, the near-IR RDP indicates a pronounced core near the O5 star HD 46150. We derive an age within 1--6 Myr, an absorption $\aV=1.7\pm0.2$, a distance from the Sun $\ds=1.6\pm0.2$ kpc ($\approx1.5$ kpc outside the Solar circle), an MF slope $\chi=0.91\pm0.13$ and a total (MS+PMS) stellar mass of $\sim625 \ms$. Its RDP is characterised by the core and cluster radii $\rc\approx5.6\arcmin$ ($\approx2.6$ pc) and $\rl\approx10\arcmin$ ($\approx4.7$ pc), respectively. Departure from dynamical equilibrium is suggested by the abnormally large core radius and the marked central stellar excess. We also investigate the elusive neighbouring OC NGC 2239, which is low-mass ($m_{MS+PMS}\approx301 \ms$), young ($5\pm4$ Myr) rather absorbed ($\aV=3.4\pm0.2$), and located in the background of NGC 2244 at $\ds=3.9\pm0.4$ kpc. Its RDP follows a King-like function of $\rc\approx0.5\arcmin\approx0.5$ pc and $\rl\approx5.0\arcmin\approx5.6$ pc. The MF slope, $\chi=1.24\pm0.06$, is essentially Salpeter's IMF. NGC 2244 is probably doomed to dissolution in a few $10^7$ yr. Wide-field extractions and field-star decontamination increase the stellar statistics and enhance both CMDs and RDPs, which is essential for faint and bright star clusters.
astro-ph.GA:From our radio observations of the magnetic field strength and large-scale pattern of spiral galaxies of different Hubble types and star formation rates (SFR) we conclude that - though a high SFR in the disk increases the total magnetic field strength in the disk and the halo - the SFR does not change the global field configuration nor influence the global scale heights of the radio emission. The similar scale heights indicate that the total magnetic field regulates the galactic wind velocities. The galactic wind itself may be essential for an effective dynamo action.
astro-ph.GA:We follow numerically the nonlinear evolution of the Parker instability in the presence of phase transitions from a warm to a cold HI interstellar medium in two spatial dimensions. The nonlinear evolution of the system favors modes that allow the magnetic field lines to cross the galactic plane. Cold HI clouds form with typical masses ~= 10^5 M_sun, mean densities ~= 20 cm^-3, mean magnetic field strengths ~= 4.3 muG (rms field strengths ~= 6.4 muG), mass-to-flux ratios ~= 0.1 - 0.3 relative to critical, temperatures ~= 50 K, (two-dimensional) turbulent velocity dispersions ~= 1.6 km s^-1, and separations ~= 500 pc, in agreement with observations. The maximum density and magnetic field strength are ~= 10^3 cm^-3 and ~= 20 muG, respectively. Approximately 60% of all HI mass is in the warm neutral medium. The cold neutral medium is arranged into sheet-like structures both perpendicular and parallel to the galactic plane, but it is also found almost everywhere in the galactic plane, with the density being highest in valleys of the magnetic field lines. `Cloudlets' also form whose physical properties are in quantitative agreement with those observed for such objects by Heiles (1967). The nonlinear phase of the evolution takes ~< 30 Myr, so that, if the instability is triggered by a nonlinear perturbation such as a spiral density shock wave, interstellar clouds can form within a time suggested by observations.
astro-ph.GA:It has been shown recently that the dynamical V-band mass-to-light ratios of compact stellar systems with masses from 10^6 to 10^8 Solar masses are not consistent with the predictions from simple stellar population (SSP) models. Top-heavy stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) in these so-called ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) offer an attractive explanation for this finding, the stellar remnants and retained stellar envelopes providing the unseen mass. We therefore construct a model which quantifies by how much the IMFs of UCDs would have to deviate in the intermediate-mass and high-mass range from the canonical IMF in order to account for the enhanced M/L_V ratio of the UCDs. The deduced high-mass IMF in the UCDs depends on the age of the UCDs and the number of faint products of stellar evolution retained by them. Assuming that the IMF in the UCDs is a three-part power-law equal to the canonical IMF in the low-mass range and taking 20% as a plausible choice for the fraction of the remnants of high-mass stars retained by UCDs, the model suggests the exponent of the high-mass IMF to be approximately 1.6 if the UCDs are 13 Gyr old (i.e. almost as old as the Universe) or approximately 1.0 if the UCDs are 7 Gyr old, in contrast to 2.3 for the Salpeter-Massey IMF. If the IMF was as top-heavy as suggested here, the stability of the UCDs might have been threatened by heavy mass loss induced by the radiation and evolution of massive stars. The central densities of UCDs must have been in the range 10^6 to 10^7 Solar masses per cubic parsec when they formed with star formation rates of 10 to 100 Solar masses per year.
astro-ph.GA:H-alpha emission from neutral halo clouds probes the radiation and hydrodynamic conditions in the halo. Armed with such measurements, we can explore how radiation escapes from the Galactic plane and how infalling gas can survive a trip through the halo. The Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) is one of the most sensitive instruments for detecting and mapping optical emission from the ISM. Here, we present recent results exploring the ionization of two infallling high-velocity complexes. First, we report on our progress mapping H-alpha emission covering the full extent of Complex A. Intensities are faint (<100 mR; EM <0.2 pc cm^-6 but correlate on the sky and in velocity with 21-cm emission. Second, we explore the ionized component of some Anti-Center Complex clouds studied by Peek et al. (2007) that show dynamic shaping from interaction with the Galactic halo.
astro-ph.GA:This article reviews observations and models of the diffuse ionized gas that permeates the disk and halo of our Galaxy and others. It was inspired by a series of invited talks presented during an afternoon scientific session of the 65th birthday celebration for Professor Carl Heiles held at Arecibo Observatory in August 2004. This review is in recognition of Carl's long standing interest in and advocacy for studies of the ionized as well as the neutral components of the interstellar medium.
astro-ph.GA:Three recent surveys of 21-cm line emission in the Galactic plane, combining single dish and interferometer observations to achieve resolution of 1 arcmin to 2 arcmin, 1 km/s, and good brightness sensitivity, have provided some 650 absorption spectra with corresponding emission spectra for study of the distribution of warm and cool phase H I in the interstellar medium. These emission-absorption spectrum pairs are used to study the temperature of the interstellar neutral hydrogen in the outer disk of the Milky Way, outside the solar circle, to a radius of 25 kpc.   The cool neutral medium is distributed in radius and height above the plane with very similar parameters to the warm neutral medium. In particular, the ratio of the emission to the absorption, which gives the mean spin temperature of the gas, stays nearly constant with radius to 25 kpc radius. This suggests that the mixture of cool and warm phases is a robust quantity, and that the changes in the interstellar environment do not force the H I into a regime where there is only one temperature allowed. The mixture of atomic gas phases in the outer disk is roughly 15% to 20% cool (40 K to 60 K), the rest warm, corresponding to mean spin temperature 250 to 400 K.   The Galactic warp appears clearly in the absorption data, and other features on the familiar longitude-velocity diagram have analogs in absorption with even higher contrast than for 21-cm emission. In the third and fourth Galactic quadrants the plane is quite flat, in absorption as in emission, in contrast to the strong warp in the first and second quadrants. The scale height of the cool gas is similar to that of the warm gas, and both increase with Galactic radius in the outer disk.
astro-ph.GA:We have examined the physical conditions in the narrow-line region (NLR) of the Seyfert 2 galaxy Markarian 3, using long-slit spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and photoionization models. We find three components of photoionized gas in the NLR. Two of these components, characterized by emission lines such as [NeV] 3426 and [OIII] 5007, lie within the envelope of the bi-conical region described in our previous kinematic study. A component of lower ionization gas, in which lines such as [OII] 3727 arise, is found to lie outside the bi-cone. Each of these components is irradiated by a power-law continuum which is attenuated by intervening gas, presumably closer to the central source. The radiation incident upon the low ionization gas, external to the bi-cone, is much more heavily absorbed. These absorbers are similar to the intrinsic UV and X-ray absorbers detected in many Seyfert 1 galaxies, which suggests that the collimation of the ionizing radiation occurs in a circumnuclear wind, rather than a thick, molecular torus. We estimate the mass for the observed NLR emitting gas to be 2 million solar-masses. It is likely that Markarian 3 acquired this gas through an on-going interaction with the spiral galaxy UGC 3422.
astro-ph.GA:We present the results of the EROS2 search for the hidden galactic matter of the halo through the gravitational microlensing of stars in the Magellanic clouds. Microlensing was also searched for and found in the Milky-Way plane, where foreground faint stars are expected to lens background stars. A total of 67 million of stars were monitored over a period of about 7 years. Hundreds of microlensing candidates have been found in the galactic plane, but only one was found towards the subsample of bright --well measured-- Magellanic stars. This result implies that massive compact halo objects (machos) in the mass range $10^{-7}M_\odot<M<5M_{\odot}$ are ruled out as a major component of the Milky Way Halo.
astro-ph.GA:Near-infrared spectroscopic data for the five Seyfert galaxies with jet-gas interaction Mrk 348, Mrk 573, Mrk 1066, NGC 7212, and NGC 7465, taken with the LIRIS near-infrared camera/spectrometer at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) are reported. The long-slit spectra reveal the characteristic strong emission lines of this type of objects. Many forbidden transitions and hydrogen recombination lines are employed here to study the excitation and ionization mechanisms that are dominating the narrow-line region emission of these objects, that is affected by the radio-jet interaction. Several absorption features are also detected in the H and K bands of these galaxies, allowing us to identify the spectral types that are producing them. We find that the continuum can be reproduced by a combination of late-type stellar templates plus a Blackbody component associated to host dust, mainly contributing to the K band emission. The detection of the permitted O I and Fe II lines and broad components of the hydrogen recombination lines in the spectra of Mrk 573 and NGC 7465 allows the reclassification of these two galaxies that are not canonical Type-2 Seyferts: Mrk 573 is confirmed to be an obscured Narrow-line Seyfert 1 and NGC 7465 is revealed for the first time as a Type-1 LINER through its near-infrared spectrum.
astro-ph.GA:Context: An unexpectedly complex polyatomic chemistry exists in diffuse clouds, allowing detection of species such as C2H, C3H2, H2CO and NH3 which have relative abundances that are strikingly similar to those inferred toward the dark cloud TMC-1   Aims: We probe the limits of complexity of diffuse cloud polyatomic chemistry.   Methods: We used the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer to search for galactic absorption from low-lying J=2-1 rotational transitions of A- and E-CH3OH near 96.740 GHz and used the VLA to search for the J=8-7 transition of HC5N at 21.3 GHz.   Results: Neither CH3OH nor HC5N were detected at column densities well below those of all polyatomics known in diffuse clouds and somewhat below the levels expected from comparison with TMC-1. The HCN/HC5N ratio is at least 3-10 times higher in diffuse gas than toward TMC-1.   Conclusions: It is possible to go to the well once (or more) too often
astro-ph.GA:Recent observations of astrophysical jets emanating from various galactic nuclei strongly suggest that a double layered structure, or a spine-sheath structure, is likely to be their common feature. We propose that such a sheath jet structure can be formed magnetohydrodynamically within a valley of the magnetic pressures, which is formed between the peaks due to the poloidal and toroidal components, with the centrifugal force acting on the rotating sheath plasma is balanced by the hoop stress of the toroidal field. The poloidal field concentrated near the polar axis is maintained by a converging plasma flow toward the jet region, and the toroidal field is developed outside the jet cone owing to the poloidal current circulating through the jet. Under such situations, the set of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations allows two main types of solutions, at least, in the region far from the footpoint. The first type solution describes the jets of marginally bound nature. This type is realized when the jet temperature decreases like viral one, and neither the pressure-gradient nor the MHD forces, which are both determined consistently, cannot completely overcome the gravity even at infinity. The second type is realized under an isothermal situation, and the gravity is cancelled exactly by the pressure-gradient force. Hence, the jets of this type are accelerated purely by the MHD force. It is suggested also that these two types correspond, respectively, to the jets from type I and II radio galaxies in the Fanaroff-Riley classification.
astro-ph.GA:We describe a new sample of 226 GPS (GHz-Peaked Spectrum) source candidates selected using simultaneous 1-22 GHz multi-frequency observations with the RATAN-600 radio telescope. Sixty objects in our sample are identified as GPS source candidates for the first time. The candidates were selected on the basis of their broad-band radio spectra only. We discuss the spectral and variability properties of selected objects of different optical classes.
astro-ph.GA:We describe Monte Carlo models for the dynamical evolution of the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. The code includes treatments of two-body relaxation, most kinds of three- and four-body interactions involving primordial binaries and those formed dynamically, the Galactic tide, and the internal evolution of both single and binary stars. We arrive at a set of initial parameters for the cluster which, after 12Gyr of evolution, gives a model with a fairly satisfactory match to the surface brightness profile, the velocity dispersion profile, and the luminosity function in two fields. We describe in particular those aspects of the evolution which distinguish this cluster from M4, which has a roughly similar mass and Galactocentric distance, but a qualitatively different surface brightness profile. Within the limitations of our modelling, we conclude that the most plausible explanation for the difference is fluctuations: both clusters are post-collapse objects, but sometimes have resolvable cores and sometimes not.
astro-ph.GA:The importance of the radiative feedback from SMBHs at the centers of elliptical galaxies is not in doubt, given the well established relations among electromagnetic output, black hole mass and galaxy optical luminosity. In addition, feedback due to mechanical and thermal deposition of energy from jets and winds emitted by the accretion disk around the central SMBH is also expected to occur. In this paper we improve and extend the accretion and feedback physics explored in our previous papers to include also a physically motivated mechanical feedback. We study the evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy with the aid of a high-resolution 1-D hydrodynamical code, where the cooling and heating functions include photoionization and Compton effects, and restricting to models which include only radiative or only mechanical feedback. We confirm that for Eddington ratios above 0.01 both the accretion and radiative output are forced by feedback effects to be in burst mode, so that strong intermittencies are expected at early times, while at low redshift the explored models are characterized by smooth, very sub-Eddington mass accretion rates punctuated by rare outbursts. However, the explored models always fail some observational tests. If we assume the high mechanical efficiency of 10^{-2.3}, we find that most of the gas is ejected from the galaxy, the resulting X-ray luminosity is far less than is typically observed and little SMBH growth occurs. But models with low enough mechanical efficiency to accomodate satisfactory SMBH growth tend to allow too strong cooling flows and leave galaxies at z=0 with E+A spectra more frequently than is observed. We conclude that both types of feedback are required. Models with combined feedback are explored in a forthcoming paper [abridged]
astro-ph.GA:The colour-magnitude diagrams of resolved stellar populations are the best tool to study the star formation histories of the host galactic regions. In this review the method to derive star formation histories by means of synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams is briefly outlined, and the results of its application to resolved galaxies of various morphological types are summarized. It is shown that all the galaxies studied so far were already forming stars at the lookback time reached by the observational data, independently of morphological type and metallicity. Early-type galaxies have formed stars predominantly, but in several cases not exclusively, at the earliest epochs. All the other galaxies appear to have experienced rather continuous star formation activities throughout their lifetimes, although with significant rate variations and, sometimes, short quiescent phases.
astro-ph.GA:We present an analysis of late-O/early-B-powered, parsec-sized bubbles and associated star-formation using 2MASS, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL and MAGPIS surveys. Three bubbles were selected from the Churchwell et al. (2007) catalog. We confirm that the structure identified in Watson et al. (2008) holds in less energetic bubbles, i.e. a PDR, identified by 8 um emission due to PAHs surrounds hot dust, identified by 24 um emission and ionized gas, identified by 20 cm continuum. We estimate the dynamical age of two bubbles by comparing bubble sizes to numerical models of Hosokawa & Inutsuka (2006). We also identify and analyze candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) using SED fitting and identify sites of possible triggered star-formation. Lastly, we identify likely ionizing sources for two sources based on SED fitting.
astro-ph.GA:Methods: 12CO emission is imaged in position and position-velocity space analyzed statistically, and then compared with maps of total reddening and with models of the C+ - CO transition in H2-bearing diffuse clouds. Results: Around Zeta Oph, 12CO emission appears in two distinct intervals of reddening centered near EBV = 0.4 and 0.65 mag, of which < 0.2 mag is background material. Within either interval, the integrated 12CO intensity varies up to 6-12 K-km/s compared to 1.5 K-km/s toward Zeta Oph. Nearly 80% of the individual profiles have velocity dispersions < 0.6 km/s, which are subsonic at the kinetic temperature derived from H2 toward Zeta Oph, 55 K. Partly as a result, 12CO emission exposes the internal, turbulent, supersonic (1-3 km/s) gas flows with especial clarity in the cores of strong lines. The flows are manifested as resolved velocity gradients in narrow, subsonically-broadened line cores. Conclusions: The scatter between N(CO) and EBV in global, CO absorption line surveys toward bright stars is present in the gas seen around Zeta Oph, reflecting the extreme sensitivity of N(12CO) to ambient conditions. The two-component nature of the optical absorption toward Zeta Oph is coincidental and the star is occulted by a single body of gas with a complex internal structure, not by two distinct clouds. The very bright 12CO lines in diffuse gas arise at N(H2) ~ 10^21/cm^2 in regions of modest density n(H) ~ 200-500/cc and somewhat more complete C+-CO conversion. Given the variety of structure in the foreground gas, it is apparent that only large surveys of absorption sightlines can hope to capture the intrinsic behavior of diffuse gas.
astro-ph.GA:Aims: We show the existence of a small family of inner-galaxy dust lanes and dust lane standing shocks beyond the two major ones that were previously known to exist Methods: We analyze images of CO emission in the inner regions of the Galaxy Results: The peculiar kinematics of the major dust lane features are repeated in several other distinct instances at l > 0deg, in one case at a contrary location 100 pc above the galactic equator at l > 3degr at the upper extremity of Clump 2. Like the previously-known dust lanes, these new examples are alsoassociated with localized, exceptionally broad line profiles believed to be characteristic of the shredding of neutral gas at the standing dust lane shocks. Conclusions: There may be secondary dust lane and standing shocks in the Milky Way bulge. The vertical structure provides a temporal sequence for understanding the secular evolution of gas flow in the bar.
astro-ph.GA:Context: Over the past thirty years a wealth of observations of CO and other molecules in optical/uv absorption in diffuse clouds has accumulated for which no comparable CO emission line data exist. Aims: To acquire mm-wave J=1-0 CO emission line profiles toward a substantial sample of commonly-studied optical/uv absorption line targets and to compare with the properties of the absorbing gas, especially the predicted emission line strengths. Methods: Using the ARO 12m telescope we observed mm-wavelength J=1-0 CO emission with spectral resolution R ~ 3x10^6 and spatial resolution 1' toward a sample of 110 lines of sight previously studied in optical/uv absorption lines of CO, \HH, CH, etc. Results: Interstellar CO emission was detected along 65 of the 110 lines of sight surveyed and there is a general superabundance of CO emission given the distribution of galactic latitudes in the survey sample. Much of the emission is optically thick or very intense and must emanate from dark clouds or warm dense gas near HII regions. Conclusions: Judging from the statistical superabundance of CO emission, seen also in the total line of sight reddening, the OB star optical/uv absorption line targets must be physically associated with the large quantities of neutral gas whose CO emission was detected, in which case they are probably influencing the absorbing gas by heating and/or photoionizing it. This explains why CO/H2 and 12CO/13CO ratios differ somewhat between $uv$ and mm-wave absorption line studies. Because the lines of sight have been preselected to have AV < 1 mag, relatively little of the associated material actually occults the targets, making it difficult for CO emission line observations to isolate the foreground gas contribution.
astro-ph.GA:We have obtained deep multi-object optical spectra of 49 HII regions in the outer disk of the spiral galaxy M83 (=NGC 5236) with the FORS2 spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. The targets span the range in galactocentric distance between 0.64 and 2.64 times the R25 isophotal radius (5.4-22.3 kpc), and 31 of them are located at R>R25, thus belonging to the extreme outer disk of the galaxy, populated by UV complexes revealed recently by the GALEX satellite. In order to derive the nebular chemical abundances, we apply several diagnostics of the oxygen abundance, including R23, [NII]/[OII] and the [OIII]4363 auroral line, which was detected in four HII regions. We find that, while inwards of the optical edge the O/H ratio follows the radial gradient known from previous investigations, the outer abundance trend flattens out to an approximately constant value. The latter varies, according to the adopted diagnostic, between 12+log(O/H)=8.2 and 12+log(O/H)=8.6 (i.e. from approximately 1/3 the solar oxygen abundance to nearly the solar value). An abrupt discontinuity in the radial oxygen abundance trend is also detected near the optical edge of the disk. These results are tentatively linked to the flat gas surface density in the outskirts of the galaxy, the relatively unevolved state of the extended disk of M83, and the redistribution of chemically enriched gas following a past galaxy encounter.
astro-ph.GA:Methods: The microscopic equations of H2-formation and protonation are integrated numerically over time in such a manner that the overall structures evolve self-consistently under benign conditions. Results: The equilibrium H2 formation timescale in an H I cloud with N(H) ~ 4x10^{20}/cm^2 is 1-3 x 10^7 yr, nearly independent of the assumed density or H2 formation rate constant on grains, etc. Attempts to speed up the evolution of the H2-fraction would require densities well beyond the range usually considered typical of diffuse gas. The calculations suggest that, under benign, quiescent conditions, formation of H2 is favored in larger regions having moderate density, consistent with the rather high mean kinetic temperatures measured in H2, 70-80 K. Formation of H3+ is essentially complete when H2-formation equilibrates but the final abundance of H3+ appears more nearly at the very last instant. Chemistry in a weakly-molecular gas has particular properties so that the abundance patterns change appreciably as gas becomes more fully molecular, either in model sequences or with time in a single model. One manifestation of this is that the predicted abundance of H3+ is much more weakly dependent on the cosmic-ray ionization rate when n(H2)/n(H) < 0.05. In general, high abundances of H3+ do not enhance the abundances of other species (e.g. HCO+) but late-time OH formation proceeds most vigourously in more diffuse regions having modest density, extinction and H2 fraction and somewhat higher fractional ionization, suggesting that atypically high OH/H2 abundance ratios might be found optically in diffuse clouds having modest extinction.
astro-ph.GA:The Parkes Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) is a survey of Galactic atomic hydrogen (HI) emission in the Southern sky covering declinations $\delta \leq 1^{\circ}$ using the Parkes Radio Telescope. The survey covers $2\pi$ steradians with an effective angular resolution of ~16', at a velocity resolution of 1.0 km/s, and with an rms brightness temperature noise of 57 mK. GASS is the most sensitive, highest angular resolution survey of Galactic HI emission ever made in the Southern sky. In this paper we outline the survey goals, describe the observations and data analysis, and present the first-stage data release. The data product is a single cube at full resolution, not corrected for stray radiation. Spectra from the survey and other data products are publicly available online.
astro-ph.GA:The magnetic structure in the Galactic disk, the Galactic center and the Galactic halo can be delineated more clearly than ever before. In the Galactic disk, the magnetic structure has been revealed by starlight polarization within 2 or 3 kpc of the Solar vicinity, by the distribution of the Zeeman splitting of OH masers in two or three nearby spiral arms, and by pulsar dispersion measures and rotation measures in nearly half of the disk. The polarized thermal dust emission of clouds at infrared, mm and submm wavelengths and the diffuse synchrotron emission are also related to the large-scale magnetic field in the disk. The rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources at low Galactic latitudes can be modeled by electron distributions and large-scale magnetic fields. The statistical properties of the magnetized interstellar medium at various scales have been studied using rotation measure data and polarization data. In the Galactic center, the non-thermal filaments indicate poloidal fields. There is no consensus on the field strength, maybe mG, maybe tens of uG. The polarized dust emission and much enhanced rotation measures of background radio sources are probably related to toroidal fields. In the Galactic halo, the antisymmetric RM sky reveals large-scale toroidal fields with reversed directions above and below the Galactic plane. Magnetic fields from all parts of our Galaxy are connected to form a global field structure. More observations are needed to explore the untouched regions and delineate how fields in different parts are connected.
astro-ph.GA:The source J 1128+5925 was found recently to show strong intraday variability at radio wavelengths and its radio variability may come from interstellar scintillation. In optical, the object was quiet in our 2007 monitoring session. Here we report the results of our new optical monitoring of this source in 2008. In addition to confirm our 2007 results, that the object did not display any clear variation on timescales from hour--day to month, we provide evidence that the object does not vary on timescale of one year, and it is probably intrinsically quiet in optical domain. Its very different behaviors in optical and radio regimes can be naturally explained if its strong radio variability comes from interstellar scintillation.
astro-ph.GA:The high redshift GPS quasar PKS 0858-279 exhibits the following properties which make the source unusual. Our RATAN-600 monitoring of 1-22 GHz spectrum has detected broad-band radio variability with high amplitude and relatively short time scale. In the same time, the milliarcsecond scale structure observed in a snapshot VLBA survey turned out to be very resolved which is not expected from the fast flux density variations. We performed 1.4-22 GHz VLBA observations of this quasar in 2005-2007. It has revealed a core-jet morphology. A high Doppler factor delta is suggested for the jet, its nature is discussed in this report on the basis of the multi-frequency VLBA and RATAN data collected. Synchrotron self-absorption was confirmed to be dominating at low frequencies, the magnetic field strength of the dominating jet feature is estimated of an order of 0.1*delta mG.
astro-ph.GA:We present photometric evolution models of galaxies, in which, in addition to the stellar component, the effects of an evolving dusty interstellar medium have been included with particular care. Starting from the work of Calura, Pipino & Matteucci (2008), in which chemical evolution models have been used to study the evolution of both the gas and dust components of the interstellar medium in the solar neighbourhood, elliptical and irregular galaxies, it has been possible to combine these models with a spectrophotometric stellar code that includes dust reprocessing (GRASIL) (Silva et al. 1998) to analyse the evolution of the spectral energy distributions (SED) of these galaxies. We test our models against observed SEDs both in the local universe and at high redshift and use them to predict how the percentage of reprocessed starlight evolves for each type of galaxy. The importance of following the dust evolution is investigated by comparing our results with those obtained by adopting simple assumptions to treat this component.
astro-ph.GA:Infrared photometry and later infrared spectroscopy provided powerful diagnostics to distinguish between the main emission mechanisms in galaxies: AGN and Starburst. After the pioneering work on infrared photometry with IRAS in the far-IR and the S.Pedro Martir and ESO ground-based work in the near-IR, ISO photometry extended up to 200um the coverage of the galaxies energy distributions. Then Spitzer collected accurate mid-infrared spectroscopy on different samples of galaxies. We will review the work done on the 12um galaxy sample since the times of IRAS photometry to the new Spitzer spectroscopy. The main results on the multifrequency data of 12um selected Seyfert galaxies are presented and discussed in the light of unification and evolution models. The spectroscopic work of Spitzer will soon be complemented at longer wavelengths by the Herschel spectrometers and in the future by SPICA at higher redshift.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the sample of 213 GPS sources selected from simultaneous multi-frequency 1-22 GHz observations obtained with RATAN-600 radio telescope. We use publicly available data to characterize parsec-scale structure of the selected sources. Among them we found 121 core dominated sources, 76 Compact Symmetric Object (CSO) candidates (24 of them are highly probable), 16 sources have complex parsec-scale morphology. Most of GPS galaxies are characterized by CSO-type morphology and lower observed peak frequency (~1.8 GHz). Most of GPS quasars are characterized by "core-jet"-type morphology and higher observed peak frequency (~3.6 GHz). This is in good agreement with previous results. However, we found a number of sources for which the general relation CSO - galaxy, core-jet - quasar does not hold. These sources deserve detailed investigation. Assuming simple synchrotron model of a homogeneous cloud we estimate characteristic magnetic field in parsec-scale components of GPS sources to be B ~ 10 mG.
astro-ph.GA:Accretion disks in AGN should be subject to the same type of instability as in cataclysmic variables (CVs) or in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which leads to dwarf nova and soft X-ray transient outbursts. It has been suggested that this thermal/viscous instability can account for the long term variability of AGNs. We test this assertion by presenting a systematic study of the application of the disk instability model (DIM) to AGNs. We are using the adaptative grid numerical code we have developed in the context of CVs, enabling us to fully resolve the radial structure of the disk. We show that, because in AGN disks the Mach numbers are very large, the heating and cooling fronts are so narrow that they cannot be resolved by the numerical codes that have been used until now. In addition, these fronts propagate on time scales much shorter than the viscous time. As a result, a sequence of heating and cooling fronts propagate back and forth in the disk, leading only to small variations of the accretion rate onto the black hole, with short quiescent states occurring for very low mass transfer rates only. Truncation of the inner part of the disk by e.g. an ADAF does not alter this result, but enables longer quiescent states. Finally we discuss the effects of irradiation by the central X-ray source, and show that, even for extremely high irradiation efficiencies, outbursts are not a natural outcome of the model.
astro-ph.GA:We outline a method for fitting binary-lens caustic-crossing microlensing events based on the alternative model parameterisation proposed and detailed in Cassan (2008). As an illustration of our methodology, we present an analysis of OGLE-2007-BLG-472, a double-peaked Galactic microlensing event with a source crossing the whole caustic structure in less than three days. In order to identify all possible models we conduct an extensive search of the parameter space, followed by a refinement of the parameters with a Markov Chain-Monte Carlo algorithm. We find a number of low-chi2 regions in the parameter space, which lead to several distinct competitive best models. We examine the parameters for each of them, and estimate their physical properties. We find that our fitting strategy locates several minima that are difficult to find with other modelling strategies and is therefore a more appropriate method to fit this type of events.
astro-ph.GA:We present new interferometric data obtained with MIDI (MID infrared Interferometric instrument) for the Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068, with an extensive coverage of sixteen uv points. These observations resolve the nuclear mid-infrared emission from NGC 1068 in unprecedented detail with a maximum resolution of 7 mas. For the first time, sufficient uv points have been obtained, allowing us to generate an image of the source using maximum entropy image reconstruction. The features of the image are similar to those obtained by modelling. We find that the mid-infrared emission can be represented by two components, each with a Gaussian brightness distribution. The first, identified as the inner funnel of the obscuring torus, is hot (800K), 1.35 parsec long, and 0.45 parsec thick in FWHM at a PA=-42 degrees (from north to east). It has an absorption profile different than standard interstellar dust and with evidence for clumpiness. The second component is 3 by 4 pc in FWHM with T=300K, and we identify it with the cooler body of the torus. The compact component is tilted by 45 degrees with respect to the radio jet and has similar size and orientation to the observed water maser distribution. We show how the dust distribution relates to other observables within a few parsecs of the core of the galaxy such as the nuclear masers, the radio jet, and the ionization cone. We compare our findings to a similar study of the Circinus galaxy and other relevant studies. Our findings shed new light on the relation between the different parsec-scale components in NGC 1068 and the obscuring torus.
astro-ph.GA:Blue hook (BHk) stars are a rare class of horizontal branch stars that so far have been found in only very few Galactic globular clusters (GCs). The dominant mechanism for producing these objects is currently still unclear. In order to test if the presence of BHk populations in a given GC is linked to specific physical or structural cluster properties, we have constructed a parent sample of GCs for which existing data is sufficient to establish the presence or absence of BHk populations with confidence. We then compare the properties of those clusters in our parent sample that do contain a BHk population to those that do not. We find that there is only one compelling difference between BHk and non-BHk clusters: all known BHk clusters are unusually massive. However, we also find that the BHk clusters are consistent with being uniformly distributed within the cumulative mass distribution of the parent sample. Thus, while it is attractive to suggest there is is a lower mass cut-off for clusters capable of forming BHk stars, the data do not require this. Instead, the apparent preference for massive clusters could still be a purely statistical effect: intrinsically rare objects can only be found by searching a sufficiently large number of stars.
astro-ph.GA:The goal of this paper is to provide a numerically fast and stable description for the microlensing amplification of an extended source (either uniform or limb-darkened) that holds in any amplification regime. We show that our method of evaluating the amplification can be implemented into a light-curve fitting routine using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. We compare the accuracy and computation times to previous methods that either work in the high-amplification regime only, or require special treatments due to the singularity of elliptic integrals.   In addition, we also provide the equations including finite lens effects in microlensing light curves. We apply our methods to the MACHO-1995-BLG-30 and the OGLE-2003-BLG-262 events and obtain results consistent to former studies. We derive an upper limit for the OGLE-2003-BLG-262 event lens size.   We conclude that our method allows to simultaneously search for point-source and finite-source microlensing events in future large area microlensing surveys in a fast manner.
astro-ph.GA:The EROS-2 project has been designed to search for microlensing events towards any dense stellar field. The densest parts of the Galactic spiral arms have been monitored to maximize the microlensing signal expected from the stars of the Galactic disk and bulge. 12.9 million stars have been monitored during 7 seasons towards 4 directions in the Galactic plane, away from the Galactic center. A total of 27 microlensing event candidates have been found. Estimates of the optical depths from the 22 best events are provided. A first order interpretation shows that simple Galactic models with a standard disk and an elongated bulge are in agreement with our observations. We find that the average microlensing optical depth towards the complete EROS-cataloged stars of the spiral arms is $\bar{\tau} =0.51\pm .13\times 10^{-6}$, a number that is stable when the selection criteria are moderately varied. As the EROS catalog is almost complete up to $I_C=18.5$, the optical depth estimated for the sub-sample of bright target stars with $I_C<18.5$ ($\bar{\tau}=0.39\pm >.11\times 10^{-6}$) is easier to interpret. The set of microlensing events that we have observed is consistent with a simple Galactic model. A more precise interpretation would require either a better knowledge of the distance distribution of the target stars, or a simulation based on a Galactic model. For this purpose, we define and discuss the concept of optical depth for a given catalog or for a limiting magnitude.
astro-ph.GA:The HII complex N44 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) provides an excellent site to perform a detailed study of star formation in a mild starburst, as it hosts three regions of star formation at different evolutionary stages and it is not as complicated and confusing as the 30 Doradus giant HII region. We have obtained Spitzer Space Telescope observations and complementary ground-based 4m uBVIJK observations of N44 to identify candidate massive young stellar objects (YSOs). We further classify the YSOs into Types I, II, and III, according to their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In our sample of 60 YSO candidates, ~65% of them are resolved into multiple components or extended sources in high-resolution ground-based images. We have modeled the SEDs of 36 YSOs that appear single or dominant within a group. We find good fits for Types I and I/II YSOs,but Types II and II/III YSOs show deviations between their observed SEDs and models that do not include PAH emission. We have also found that some Type III YSOs have central holes in their disk components. YSO counterparts are found in four ultracompact HII regions and their stellar masses determined from SED model fits agree well with those estimated from the ionization requirements of the HII regions. The distribution of YSOs is compared with those of the underlying stellar population and interstellar gas conditions to illustrate a correlation between the current formation of O-type stars and previous formation of massive stars. Evidence of triggered star formation is also presented.
astro-ph.GA:This is the initial paper in a series presenting the first optical detections and subsequent follow-up spectroscopy of known Southern Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) previously discovered in the radio. These new detections come from the AAO/UKST HAlpha survey of the Southern Galactic plane which has opened up fresh opportunities to study Galactic remnants. Here we present the first optical imaging and follow-up spectra of Galactic SNR G279.0+1.1 where a series of 14 small-scale fragmented groups of HAlpha filaments have been discovered in a ~2.3 deg. area centred on G279.0+1.1. Individually they are somewhat inconspicuous but collectively they are completely enclosed within the overall radio contours of this known SNR. Three of these filamentary groupings are particularly prominent and optical spectra have been obtained across two of them. Their morphological structure and spectral characteristics are typical of optically detected SNR filaments. Very strong [S II] emission relative to H has been detected with [S II]/HAlpha 0.7 and 1.1, confirming strong, shock heated emission. This is sufficient to classify these filaments in the likely SNR domain and therefore indicating a direct connection with the radio remnant. Other typical SNR emission lines such as [O II] at 3727A, HBeta, [O III] at 4959 and 5007A, HAlpha and [N II] at 6548 and 6584A were also detected, lending strong support to an SNR origin of these optical filaments. The value and insights that these optical data can provide for known remnants are discussed along with their relevance to the Galactic nitrogen abundance. A serendipitous discovery of an adjacent H II region is also briefly described.
astro-ph.GA:We demonstrate for the first time that gaseous halos of disk galaxies can play a vital role in recycling metal-rich gas ejected from the bulges and thus in promoting chemical evolution of disks. Our numerical simulations show that metal-rich stellar winds from bulges in disk galaxies can be accreted onto the thin disks owing to hydrodynamical interaction between the gaseous ejecta and the gaseous halos, if the mean densities of the halos (rho_ hg) are as high as 10^{-5} cm^{-3}. The total amount of gas that is ejected from a bulge through a stellar wind and then accreted onto the disk depends mainly on rho_ hg and the initial velocity of the stellar wind. About ~ 1% of gaseous ejecta from bulges in disk galaxies of scale length a_d can be accreted onto disks around R ~ 2.5 a_ d for a reasonable set of model parameters. We discuss these results in the context of the origin of the surprisingly high metallicities of the solar neighborhood disk stars in the Galaxy. We also discuss some implications of the present results in terms of chemical evolution of disk galaxies with possibly different rho_ hg in different galaxy environments.
astro-ph.GA:Using high-resolution data of the linearly polarized intensity and polarization angle at 3.6, 6.2, and 20 cm together with a 3-D model of the regular magnetic field, we study variations of the structure, strength, and energy density of the magnetic field in the Scd galaxy M33. The regular magnetic field consists of a horizontal component (represented by an axisymmetric mode from 1 to 3 kpc radius and a superposition of axisymmetric and bisymmetric modes from 3 to 5 kpc radius) and a vertical component. However, the inferred `vertical field' may be partly due to a galactic warp. We estimate the average total and regular magnetic field strengths as ~ 6.4 and 2.5 $\mu$G, respectively. Generation of interstellar magnetic fields by turbulent gas motion in M33 is indicated as the turbulent and magnetic energy densities are about equal.
astro-ph.GA:Black hole mass determination in active galaxies is a key issue in understanding various luminosity states. In the present paper we try to generalise the mass determination method based on the X-ray excess variance, successfully used for typical broad line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1) to Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. NLS1 galaxies differ from BLS1 with respect to several properties. They are generally more variable in 2-10 keV energy band so the natural expectation is the need to use a different scaling coefficient between the mass and the variance in these two types of sources. However, we find that such a simple approach is not enough. Although for majority of the 21 NLS1 galaxies in our sample a single scaling coefficient (larger by a factor 20) provided us with a satisfactory method of mass determination, in a small subset of NLS1 galaxies this approach failed. Variability of those objects appeared to be at the intermediate level between NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies. These exceptional NLS1 galaxies have much harder soft X-ray spectra than majority of NLS1 galaxies. We thus postulate that the division of Seyfert 1 galaxies into BLS1 and NLS1 according to the widths of the Hbeta line is less generic than according to the soft X-ray slope.
astro-ph.GA:The Galactic Center lobe is a degree-tall shell seen in radio continuum images of the Galactic center (GC) region. If it is actually located in the GC region, formation models would require massive energy input (e.g., starburst or jet) to create it. At present, observations have not strongly constrained the location or physical conditions of the GC lobe. This paper describes the analysis of new and archival single-dish observations of radio recombination lines toward this enigmatic object. The observations find that the ionized gas has a morphology similar to the radio continuum emission, suggesting that they are associated. We study averages of several transitions from H106alpha to H191epsilon and find that the line ratios are most consistent with gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio recombination line widths are remarkably narrow, constraining the typical electron temperature to be less than about 4000 K. These observations also find evidence of pressure broadening in the higher electronic states, implying a gas density of n_e=910^{+310}_{-450} cm^{-3}. The electron temperature, gas pressure, and morphology are all consistent with the idea that the GC lobe is located in the GC region. If so, the ionized gas appears to form a shell surrounding the central 100 parsecs of the galaxy with a mass of roughly 10^5 Msun, similar to ionized outflows seen in dwarf starbursts.
astro-ph.GA:In February 1997, the Japanese radio astronomy satellite HALCA was launched to provide the space-bourne element for the VLBI Space Observatory Programme (VSOP) mission. A significant fraction of the mission time was to be dedicated to the VSOP Survey of bright compact Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at 5 GHz, which was lead by ISAS. The VSOP Survey Sources are an unbiased dataset of 294 targets, of which 82% were successfully observed. These are now undergoing statistical analysis to tease out the characteristics of typical AGN sources. We present here the summary of the imaging and conclusions we have reached.
astro-ph.GA:We test the reliability of infrared (IR) emission to trace star formation in individual star-forming sites of M33, and outline a new method for testing the distribution function of massive stars in newly formed clusters. We select IR sources from the Spitzer survey of M33 and show that the IR and Halpha luminosities are not correlated. Complementing the infrared photometry with GALEX-UV data, we estimate the source bolometric luminosities. For a given stellar IMF we simulate a theoretical curve for the expected bolometric-to-Halpha luminosity ratio, along which stellar clusters are born. We call this the cluster birthline in the Lbol--Lbol/LHal plane. The birthline is flat for Lbol>3x10^{39}erg/s because all clusters fully sample the IMF and it increases toward lower luminosities as the upper end of the IMF becomes incompletely sampled. The observations of M33 show that young isolated clusters lie close to the theoretical birthline for a wide range of Lbol. The luminosity is not proportional to Halpha emission for low mass clusters and aging moves clusters above the birthline. The best fit to the birthline is for a randomly sampled IMF, in which the mass of most massive star in a cluster is not strictly limited by the cluster's mass. We also find that the IR luminosity of young stellar clusters in M33 is not proportional to their bolometric luminosity. This irregularity could be the result of low and patchy dust abundance in M33.
astro-ph.GA:We present results of three-dimensional, fully nonlinear MHD simulations of a large-scale magnetic field evolution in a barred galaxy. The model does not take into consideration the dynamo process. We find that the obtained magnetic field configurations are highly similar to the observed maps of the polarized intensity of barred galaxies, because the modeled vectors form coherent structures along the bar and spiral arms. Due to the dynamical influence of the bar the gas forms spiral waves which go radially outward. Each spiral arm forms the magnetic arm which stays much longer in the disk, than the gaseous spiral structure. Additionally the modeled total energy of magnetic field grows due to strong compression and shear of non-axisymmetrical bar flows and differential rotation, respectively.
astro-ph.GA:The interstellar medium (ISM) is a key ingredient in galaxy formation and evolution as it provides the molecular gas reservoir which fuels star formation and supermassive black hole accretion. Yet the ISM is one of the least studied aspects of distant galaxies. Molecular and atomic transitions at (sub)millimetre wavelengths hold great promise in measuring macroscopic properties (e.g. masses, morphologies, star formation laws), as well as microscopic properties (e.g. gas densities, temperatures, cooling) of high-z galaxies. In this overview I summarize the growing number of high-z molecular line detections, highlighting some of the most intriguing results along the way. I end by discussing a few areas where future facilities (e.g. ALMA, EVLA, CCAT, LMT) will drastically improve on the current state of affairs.
astro-ph.GA:In this second of a series of papers on spatially resolved star formation, we investigate the impact of the density-morphology relation of galaxies on the spatial variation of star formation (SF) and its dependence on environment. We find that while a density-morphology relation is present for the sample, it cannot solely explain the observed suppression of SF in galaxies in high-density environments. We also find that early-type and late-type galaxies exhibit distinct radial star formation rate (SFR) distributions, with early-types having a SFR distribution that extends further relative to the galaxy scale length, compared to late-types at all densities. We find that a suppression of SF in the highest density environments is found in the highest star forming galaxies for both galaxy types. This suppression occurs in the innermost regions in late-types (r <= 0.125 Petrosian radii), and further out in radius in early-types (0.125< r <= 0.25 Petrosian radii). When the full sample is considered no clear suppression of SF is detected, indicating that the environmental trends are driven only by the highest SF galaxies. We demonstrate that the density-morphology relation alone cannot account for the suppression of SF in the highest density environments. This points to an environmentally-governed evolutionary mechanism that affects the SF in the innermost regions in both early and late-type galaxies. We suggest that this is a natural consequence of the "downsizing" of SF in galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:To date the onset of large-scale star formation in galaxies and its link to gravitational stability of the galactic disk have not been fully understood. The nearby face-on spiral galaxy M51 is an ideal target for studying this subject. This paper combines CO, dust, HI, and stellar maps of M51 and its companion galaxy to study the H2/HI transition, the gas-to-dust ratios, and the stability of the disk against gravitational collapse. We combine maps of the molecular gas using 12CO 2--1 map HERA/IRAM-30m data and HI VLA data to study the total gas surface density and the phase transition of atomic to molecular gas. The total gas surface density is compared to the dust surface density from 850 micron SCUBA data. Taking into account the velocity dispersions of the molecular and atomic gas, and the stellar surface densities derived from the 2MASS K-band survey, we derive the total Toomre Q parameter of the disk. The gas surface density in the spiral arms is approximately 2-3 higher compared to that of the interarm regions. The ratio of molecular to atomic surface density shows a nearly power-law dependence on the hydrostatic pressure P_hydro. The gas surface density distribution in M51 shows an underlying exponential distribution with a scale length of h_gas=7.6 kpc representing 55% of the total gas mass, comparable to the properties of the exponential dust disk. In contrast to the velocity widths observed in HI, the CO velocity dispersion shows enhanced line widths in the spiral arms compared to the interarm regions. The contribution of the stellar component in the Toomre Q-parameter analysis is significant and lowers the combined Q-parameter Q_tot by up to 70% towards the threshold for gravitational instability. The value of Q_tot varies from 1.5-3 in radial averages. A map of Q_tot shows values around 1 on the spiral arms.
astro-ph.GA:We present high resolution images of the 12CO(2-1) emission in the central 1' (1 kpc) of NGC 5128 (Centaurus A), observed using the SMA. We elucidate for the first time the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in this region with a resolution of 6'.0 x 2'.4 (100 pc x 40 pc). We spatially resolve the circumnuclear molecular gas in the inner 24'' x 12'' (400 pc x 200 pc), which is elongated along a position angle P.A. = 155 deg and perpendicular to the radio/X-ray jet. The SE and NW components of the circumnuclear gas are connected to molecular gas found at larger radii. This gas appears as two parallel filaments at P.A. = 120 deg, which are coextensive with the long sides of the 3 kiloparsec parallelogram shape of the previously observed dust continuum, as well as ionized and pure rotational H2 lines. Spatial and kinematical asymmetries are apparent in both the circumnuclear and outer gas, suggesting non-coplanar and/or non-circular motions. We extend to inner radii (r < 200 pc) previously studied warped disk models built to reproduce the central parallelogram-shaped structure. Adopting the warped disk model we would confirm a gap in emission between the radii r = 200 - 800 pc (12'' - 50''), as has been suggested previously. Although this model explains this prominent feature, however, our 12CO(2-1) observations show relevant deviations from this model. Namely, the physical connection between the circumnuclear gas and that at larger radii, brighter SE and NW sides on the parallelogram-shaped feature, and an outer curvature of its long sides. Overall it resembles more closely an S-shaped morphology, a trend that is also found in other molecular species. Hence, we explore qualitatively the possible contribution of a weak bi-symmetric potential which would naturally explain these peculiarities.
astro-ph.GA:The spatial distributions of the most recently discovered ultra faint dwarf satellites around the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy are compared to the previously reported discs-of-satellites (DoS) of their host galaxies. In our investigation we pay special attention to the selection bias introduced due to the limited sky coverage of SDSS. We find that the new Milky Way satellite galaxies follow closely the DoS defined by the more luminous dwarfs, thereby further emphasizing the statistical significance of this feature in the Galactic halo. We also notice a deficit of satellite galaxies with Galactocentric distances larger than 100 kpc that are away from the disc-of-satellites of the Milky Way. In the case of Andromeda, we obtain similar results, naturally complementing our previous finding and strengthening the notion that the discs-of-satellites are optical manifestations of a phase-space correlation of satellite galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:Observations of the Galactic Centre show evidence of disc-like structures of very young stars orbiting the central super-massive black hole within a distance of a few 0.1 pc. While it is widely accepted that about half of the stars form a relatively flat disc rotating clockwise on the sky, there is a substantial ongoing debate on whether there is a second, counter-clockwise disc of stars.   By means of N-body simulations using our bhint code, we show that two highly inclined stellar discs with the observed properties cannot be recognised as two flat circular discs after 5 Myr of mutual interaction. Instead, our calculations predict a significant warping of the two discs, which we show to be apparent among the structures observed in the Galactic Centre. While the high eccentricities of the observed counter-clockwise orbits suggest an eccentric origin of this system, we show the eccentricity distribution in the inner part of the more massive clockwise disc to be perfectly consistent with an initially circular disc in which stellar eccentricities increase due to both non-resonant and resonant relaxation.   We conclude that the relevant question to ask is therefore not whether there are two discs of young stars, but whether there were two such discs to begin with.
astro-ph.GA:The growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies are thought to be linked, but the precise nature of this symbiotic relationship is still poorly understood. Both observations and simulations of galaxy formation suggest that the energy input from active galactic nuclei (AGN), as the central supermassive black hole accretes material and grows, heats the interstellar material and suppresses star formation. In this Letter, we show that most host galaxies of moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes in the local universe have intermediate optical colors that imply the host galaxies are transitioning from star formation to quiescence, the first time this has been shown to be true for all AGN independent of obscuration. The intermediate colors suggest that star formation in the host galaxies ceased roughly 100 Myr ago. This result indicates that either the AGN are very long-lived, accreting for more than 1 Gyr beyond the end of star formation, or there is a ~100 Myr time delay between the shutdown of star formation and detectable black hole growth. The first explanation is unlikely given current estimates for AGN lifetimes, so low-lumiosity AGN must shut down star formation before substantial black hole accretion activity is detected. The scarcity of AGN host galaxies in the blue cloud reported here challenges scenarios where significant star formation and black hole growth are coeval. Lastly, these observations also strongly support the `Unified Model' of AGN as the host galaxy colors are independent of obscuration towards the central engine.
astro-ph.GA:We investigated the kinematic and excitation structure of the NGC 1068 narrow-line region (NLR). We obtained profiles of several emission lines, [OIII]$\lambda$5007, H$\beta$, [OI]$\lambda$6300 and [FeVII]$\lambda$6087 at high-velocity resolution (R ~ 7500 - 11000), and confirmed that they showed different profiles. These profiles are useful for understanding the NLR structure, as they cover a wide ionization potential range. By comparing the results with a photoionization model, we found that 1) blueshifted components at the center are very dense, 2) those in the northeast region have slightly lower densities than those in the center, and 3) ionization parameters of the blueshifted components increase with increasing velocity with respect to the systemic velocity. We investigated the NLR structure in NGC 1068 based on these results. We show that both the observed velocity dependence of the ionization parameter and the gradually increasing velocity field can be reproduced by varying the ionizing continuum attenuation, assuming a hollowed biconical geometry and varying the column densities of outflowing clouds.
astro-ph.GA:Microlensing observations towards M31 are a powerful tool for the study of the dark matter population in the form of MACHOs both in the Galaxy and the M31 halos, a still unresolved issue, as well as for the analysis of the characteristics of the M31 luminous populations. In this work we present the second year results of our pixel lensing campaign carried out towards M31 using the 152 cm Cassini telescope in Loiano. We have established an automatic pipeline for the detection and the characterisation of microlensing variations. We have carried out a complete simulation of the experiment and evaluated the expected signal, including an analysis of the efficiency of our pipeline. As a result, we select 1-2 candidate microlensing events (according to different selection criteria). This output is in agreement with the expected rate of M31 self-lensing events. However, the statistics are still too low to draw definitive conclusions on MACHO lensing.
astro-ph.GA:In this paper we present extinction properties of interstellar dust in a prominent dust lane galaxy NGC 4370 based on the optical broad band (BVRI) imaging observations taken from the Himalaya Chandra Telescope (HCT), Hanle and the near-IR (J,H,K$_s$) images taken from the 2MASS archive. NGC 4370 belongs to the Virgo cluster (VCC 0758) and form a non-interactive pair with NGC 4365 at 10$\arcmin$. NGC 4370 hosts a prominent dust lane running parallel to its optical major axis and is extended almost up to 1\arcmin. The extinction curve derived for NGC 4370 is found to run parallel to Galactic extinction curve, implying that the properties of dust in NGC 4370 are identical to those of the canonical grains in the Milky Way. The $R_V$ value is found to be equal to 2.85$\pm$0.05 and is consitent with the values reported for the dust lane galaxies. The total dust content of NGC 4370 estimated using optical extinction and IRAS flux densities are found to be equal to $4.4\times 10^4$ \msol and $2.0\times 10^5$ \msol, respectively. As regard to the origin of dust and ISM in this galaxy, the accumulated dust by this galaxy over its life-time is insufficient to account for the detected mass by optical means, which in turn imply that the ISM might have been acquired by the NGC 4370 through a merger like event. An attempt is also made to study the apparent spatial correspondence between the multiple phases of ISM, i.e., hot gas, warm gas and dust in this galaxy by obtaining optical emission maps from narrow band imaging and diffuse X-ray emission map obtained from the analysis of \emph{Chandra} archival data. This analysis implies a physical connection between the dust and warm gas in terms of their physical co-existence and common origin too.
astro-ph.GA:We present a homogeneous and 92 % complete dataset of optical nuclear spectra for the 113 3CR radio sources with redshifts < 0.3, obtained with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. For these sources we could obtain uniform and uninterrupted coverage of the key spectroscopic optical diagnostics. The observed sample, including powerful classical FR II radio-galaxies and FR I, together spanning four orders of magnitude in radio-luminosity, provides a broad representation of the spectroscopic properties of radio galaxies. In this first paper we present an atlas of the spectra obtained, provide measurements of the diagnostic emission line ratios, and identify active nuclei with broad line emission. These data will be used in follow-up papers to address the connection between the optical spectral characteristics and the multiwavelength properties of the sample.
astro-ph.GA:We present the first results of the expected variations of the molecular line emission arising from material recently affected by C-shocks (shock precursors). Our parametric model of the structure of C-shocks has been coupled with a radiative transfer code to calculate the molecular excitation and line profiles of shock tracers such as SiO, and of ion and neutral molecules such as H13CO+ and HN13C, as the shock propagates through the unperturbed medium. Our results show that the SiO emission arising from the early stage of the magnetic precursor typically has very narrow line profiles slightly shifted in velocity with respect to the ambient cloud. This narrow emission is generated in the region where the bulk of the ion fluid has already slipped to larger velocities in the precursor as observed toward the young L1448-mm outflow. This strongly suggests that the detection of narrow SiO emission and of an ion enhancement in young shocks, is produced by the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. In addition, our model shows that the different velocity components observed toward this outflow can be explained by the coexistence of different shocks at different evolutionary stages, within the same beam of the single-dish observations.
astro-ph.GA:We review the use of velocity centroids statistics to recover information of interstellar turbulence from observations. Velocity centroids have been used for a long time now to retrieve information about the scaling properties of the turbulent velocity field in the interstellar medium. We show that, while they are useful to study subsonic turbulence, they do not trace the statistics of velocity in supersonic turbulence, because they are highly influenced by fluctuations of density. We show also that for sub-Alfv\'enic turbulence (both supersonic and subsonic) two-point statistics (e.g. correlation functions or power-spectra) are anisotropic. This anisotropy can be used to determine the direction of the mean magnetic field projected in the plane of the sky.
astro-ph.GA:We present the results of a Suzaku monitoring campaign of the Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC7582. The source is characterized by very rapid (on timescales even lower than a day) changes of the column density of an inner absorber, together with the presence of constant components arising as reprocessing from a Compton-thick material. The best fitting scenario implies important modifications to the zeroth order view of Unified Models. While the existence of a pc-scale torus is needed in order to produce a constant Compton reflection component and an iron K$\alpha$ emission line, in this Seyfert 2 galaxy this is not viewed along the line of sight. On the other hand, the absorption of the primary continuum is due to another material, much closer to the BH, roughly at the distance of the BLR, which can produce the observed rapid spectral variability. On top of that, the constant presence of a $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ column density can be ascribed to the presence of a dust lane, extended on a galactic scale, as previously confirmed by Chandra. There is now mounting evidence that complexity in the obscuration of AGN may be the rule rather than the exception. We therefore propose to modify the Unification Model, adding to the torus the presence of two further absorbers/emitters. Their combination along the line of sight can reproduce all the observed phenomenology.
astro-ph.GA:Observations show that magnetic fields in the interstellar medium (ISM) often do not respond to increases in gas density as would be naively expected for a frozen-in field. This may suggest that the magnetic field in the diffuse gas becomes detached from dense clouds as they form. We have investigated this possibility using theoretical estimates, a simple magneto-hydrodynamic model of a flow without mass conservation and numerical simulations of a thermally unstable flow. Our results show that significant magnetic flux can be shed from dense clouds as they form in the diffuse ISM, leaving behind a magnetically dominated diffuse gas.
astro-ph.GA:Galactic winds in dwarf galaxies are driven by the energy released by supernova explosions and stellar winds following an intense episode of star formation, which create an over-pressured cavity of hot gas. Although the luminosity of the star formation episode and the mass of the galaxy play a key role in determining the occurrence of the galactic winds and the fate of the freshly produced metals, other parameters play an equally important role. In this contribution we address the following questions (i) What is the late evolution of superbubbles and what is the final fate of the superbubble cavities? (ii) How does the multi-phase nature of the ISM, in particular the coexistence of hot gas with embedded clouds, affect the development of galactic winds? (iii) What is the relation between the flattening of a galaxy and the development of bipolar galactic winds?
astro-ph.GA:Using deep J, H and Ks-band observations, we have studied the near-infrared (nIR) extinction of the Nuclear Bulge (NB) and we find significant, complex variations on small physical scales. We have applied a new variable nIR colour excess method, V-NICE, to measure the extinction; this method allows for variation in both the extinction law parameter alpha and the degree of absolute extinction on very small physical scales. We see significant variation in both these parameters on scales of 5 arcsec. In our observed fields, representing a random sample of sight lines to the NB, we measure alpha to be 2.64 +- 0.52, compared to the canonical "universal" value of 2. Our measured levels of A_Ks are similar to previously measured results (1 < A_Ks < 4.5); however, the steeper extinction law results in higher values for A_J (4.5 < A_J < 10) and A_H (1.5 < A_H < 6.5). Only when the extinction law is allowed to vary on the smallest scales can we recover self-consistent measures of the absolute extinction at each wavelength, allowing accurate reddening corrections for field star photometry in the NB. The steeper extinction law slope also suggests that previous conversions of nIR extinction to A_V may need to be reconsidered. Finally, we find that the measured values of extinction are significantly dependent on the filter transmission functions of the instrument used to obtain the data. This effect must be taken into account when combining or comparing data from different instruments.
astro-ph.GA:Although the continua of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are typically dominated by synchrotron radiation over virtually the entire spectrum, it is not clear whether the radio and higher-frequency emission originate in the same or different parts of the jet. Several different radio--optical correlations based on polarization data have been found recently, suggesting that the optical and radio polarization may be closely related, and that the corresponding emission regions may be cospatial (Gabuzda et. al2006, Jorstad et al. 2007, D'Arcangelo et al. 2007) Our joint analysis of optical and VLBA polarization data for a sample of about 40 AGNs shows that, after correction for the inferred VLBA core Faraday rotations, most BL Lac objects and some quasars have aligned VLBA-core and optical polarizations, although many quasars also show no obvious relationship between their VLBA-core and optical polarization angles. This may indicate that not all AGNs have cospatial regions of optical and radio emission in their jets. However, another possibility is that some of the 7mm-2cm VLBA cores have Faraday rotations of the order of several tens of thousand of rad/m^2, which were not properly fit by our three-frequency data due to n*pi ambiguities in the observed polarization angles, leading to incorrect subtraction of the effects of the core Faraday rotation, and so incorrect "zero-wavelength" radio polarization angles. The possibility of such high core Faraday rotations is supported by the results of the parsec-scale Faraday-rotation studies of Zavala & Taylor (2004) and Jorstad et al. (2007).
astro-ph.GA:We show a comparison of the rest-frame UV morphologies of a sample of 162 intermediate redshift (median redshift 1.02) galaxies with their rest-frame optical morphologies. We select our sample from the deepest near-UV image obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using the WFPC2 (F300W) as part of the parallel observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field campaign overlapping with the HST/ACS GOODS dataset. We perform single component Sersic fits in both WFPC2/F300W (rest-frame UV) and ACS/F850LP (rest-frame optical) bands and deduce that the Sersic index $n$ is estimated to be smaller in the rest-frame UV compared to the rest-frame optical, leading to an overestimation of the number of merger candidates by ~40-100% compared to the rest-frame optical depending upon the cutoff in $n$ employed for identifying merger candidates. This effect seems to be dominated by galaxies with low values of n(F300W) <= 0.5 that have a value of n(F850LP) ~ 1.0. We argue that these objects are probably clumpy starforming galaxies or minor mergers, both of which are essentially contaminants, if one is interested in identifying major mergers.   In addition we also find evidence that the axis ratio b/a is lower, i.e. ellipticity (1-b/a) is higher in rest-frame UV compared to the rest-frame optical. Moreover, we find that in the rest-frame UV, the number of high ellipticity (e >= 0.8) objects are higher by a factor of ~2.8 compared to the rest-frame optical. This indicates that the reported dominance of elongated morphologies among high-z LBGs might just be a bias related to the use of rest-frame UV datasets in high-z studies.
astro-ph.GA:We present a new method to detect and quantify mass segregation in star clusters. It compares the minimum spanning tree (MST) of massive stars with that of random stars. If mass segregation is present, the MST length of the most massive stars will be shorter than that of random stars. This difference can be quantified (with an associated significance) to measure the degree of mass segregation. We test the method on simulated clusters in both 2D and 3D and show that the method works as expected.   We apply the method to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and show that the method is able to detect the mass segregation in the Trapezium with a `mass segregation ratio' \Lambda_{MSR}=8.0 \pm 3.5 (where \Lambda_{MSR}=1 is no mass segregation) down to 16 \Msun, and also that the ONC is mass segregated at a lower level (~2.0 \pm 0.5) down to 5 \Msun. Below 5 \Msun we find no evidence for any further mass segregation in the ONC.
astro-ph.GA:A study of the ionized and neutral gas kinematics near 23 WR stars in the Irr galaxy IC10 are provided. For most of the stars sings of the WR winds impact on the interstellar medium were detected. A rough estimate of the power of wind WR stars is about ~(0.01-0.84) 10^38 erg / sec.
astro-ph.GA:We discuss the results of the first model of the gas dynamics in the Milky Way in the presence of two bars: the large scale primary bar or boxy bulge and a secondary bar in the Galactic center region. We have obtained an accurate potential by modeling 2MASS star counts and we have used this potential to simulate the gas dynamics. As a first approximation we have used one single pattern speed \Omega_p. The models with Omega_p=30-40 \kmskpc and a primary bar orientation of 20-35 deg reproduce successfully many characteristics of the observed longitude-velocity diagrams as the terminal velocity curve or the spiral arm tangent points. The Galactic Molecular Ring is not an actual ring but the inner part of the spiral arms, within corotation. The model reproduces quantitatively the "3-kpc arm" and the recently found far-side counterpart, which are the lateral arms that contour the bar. In the Galactic center region, the model reproduces the 1-kpc HI ring and the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), which is the gas response to the secondary bar. In order to reproduce the observed parallelogram shape of the CO longitude velocity diagram of the CMZ, the secondary bar should be oriented by and angle of 60-70 deg with respect to the Sun-GC line. The mass of the secondary bar amounts to (2-5.5)10^9 Msun, which is 10-25 % of the mass of the primary bar.
astro-ph.GA:We present the results of the one year long observational campaign of the type II-plateau SN 2005cs, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy M51 (the Whirlpool Galaxy). This extensive dataset makes SN 2005cs the best observed low-luminosity, 56Ni-poor type II-plateau event so far and one of the best core-collapse supernovae ever. The optical and near-infrared spectra show narrow P-Cygni lines characteristic of this SN family, which are indicative of a very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. The optical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactive tail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. Numerous unfiltered observations obtained by amateur astronomers give us the rare opportunity to monitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. In addition to optical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (together with already published UV observations) allow us to construct for the first time a reliable bolometric light curve for an object of this class. Finally, comparing the observed data with those derived from a semi-analytic model, we infer for SN 2005cs a 56Ni mass of about 0.003 solar masses, a total ejected mass of 8-13 solar masses and an explosion energy of about 3 x 10^50 erg.
astro-ph.GA:We present a mid-infrared spectroscopic data cube of the central part of 30 Doradus, observed with Spitzer's IRS and MIPS/SED mode. Aromatic dust emission features and emission lines from molecular and atomic hydrogen are detected but not particularly strong. The dominant spectral features are emission lines from moderately ionized species of argon, neon, and sulphur, which are used to determine the physical conditions in the ionized gas. The ionized gas excitation shows strong variations on parsec scales, some of which can plausibly be associated with individual hot stars. We fit the ionic line strengths with photoionization and shock models, and find that photoionization dominates in the region. The ionization parameter U traces the rim of the central bubble, as well as highlighting isolated sources of ionization, and at least one quiescent clump. The hardness of the ionizing radiation field T_rad reveals several "hot spots" that are either the result of individual very hot stars or trace the propagation of the diffuse ionizing field through the surrounding neutral cloud. Consistent with other measurements of giant molecular hydrogen regions, log(U) ranges between -3 and -0.75, and T_rad between 30000 and 85000K.
astro-ph.GA:Cluster galaxies moving through the intracluster medium (ICM) are expected to lose some of their interstellar medium (ISM) through ISM-ICM interactions. We perform high resolution (40 pc) three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping including radiative cooling in order to investigate stripping of a multiphase medium. The clumpy, multiphase ISM is self-consistently produced by the inclusion of radiative cooling, and spans six orders of magnitude in gas density. We find no large variations in the amount of gas lost whether or not cooling is involved, although the gas in the multiphase galaxy is stripped more quickly and to a smaller radius. We also see significant differences in the morphology of the stripped disks. This occurs because the multiphase medium naturally includes high density clouds set inside regions of lower density. We find that the lower density gas is stripped quickly from any radius of the galaxy, and the higher density gas can then be ablated. If high density clouds survive, through interaction with the ICM they lose enough angular momentum to drift towards the center of the galaxy where they are no longer stripped. Finally, we find that low ram pressure values compress gas into high density clouds that could lead to enhanced star formation, while high ram pressure leads to a smaller amount of high-density gas.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) The formation of massive spheroidal galaxies is studied on a visually classified sample of 910 galaxies extracted from the ACS/HST images of the GOODS North and South fields (0.4<z<.5). Three key observables are considered: comoving number density, internal colour distribution; and the Kormendy relation. The comoving number density of the most massive galaxies is found not to change significantly with redshift. One quarter of the whole sample of early-types are photometrically classified as blue galaxies. On a volume-limited subset out to z<0.7, the average stellar mass of the blue ellipticals is 5E9Msun compared to 4E10Msun for red ellipticals. On a volume-limited subsample of bright galaxies (Mv<-21) out to z=1.4 we find only 4% are blue early-types, in contrast with 26% for the full sample. The intrinsic colour distribution correlates overall bluer colours with **blue cores** (positive radial gradients of colour), suggesting an inside-out process of formation. The redshift evolution of the observed colour gradients is incompatible with a significant variaton in stellar age within each galaxy. The slope of the Kormendy relation in the subsample of massive galaxies does not change between z=0 and z=1.4.
astro-ph.GA:Young radio-loud active galactic nuclei form an important tool to investigate the evolution of extragalactic radio sources. To study the early phases of expanding radio sources, we have constructed CORALZ, a sample of 25 compact ($\theta<2"$) radio sources associated with nearby ($z<0.16$) galaxies. In this paper we determine the morphologies, linear sizes, and put first constraints on the lobe expansion speeds of the sources in the sample. We observed the radio sources from the CORALZ sample with MERLIN at 1.4 GHz or 1.6 GHz, the EVN at 1.6 GHz, and global VLBI at 1.6 GHz and/or 5.0 GHz. Radio maps, morphological classifications, and linear sizes are presented for all sources in the CORALZ sample. We have determined a first upper limit to the expansion velocity of one of the sources, which is remarkably low compared to the brighter GPS sources at higher redshifts, indicating a relation between radio luminosity and expansion speed, in agreement with analytical models. In addition we present further strong evidence that the spectral turnovers in GPS and CSS sources are caused by synchrotron self-absorption (SSA): the CORALZ sources are significantly offset from the well-known correlation between spectral peak frequency and angular size, but this correlation is recovered after correcting for the flux-density dependence, as predicted by SSA theory.
astro-ph.GA:Abridged: We use three-dimensional SPH simulations to investigate the collapse of low-mass prestellar cores and the formation and early evolution of protostellar discs. The initial conditions are slightly supercritical Bonnor-Ebert spheres in rigid rotation. The core mass and initial radius are held fixed at M_O=6.1 M_sun and R_O=17,000 AU, and the only parameter that we vary is the initial angular speed \Omega_O. Protostellar discs forming from cores with \Omega_O<1.35 10d-13 1/s have radii between 100 and 300 AU and are quite centrally concentrated; due to heating by gas infall onto the disc and accretion onto the central object, they are also quite warm, T>100 K, and therefore stable against gravitational fragmentation. In contrast, more rapidly rotating cores form discs which are less concentrated and cooler, and have radii between 400 and 1000 AU; as a consequence they are prone to gravitational fragmentation and the formation of multiple systems. We derive a criterion that predicts whether a rigidly rotating core having given M_O, R_O and \Omega_O will produce a protostellar disc which fragments whilst material is still infalling from the core envelope. We then apply this criterion to core samples for which M_O, R_O and \Omega_O have been estimated observationally. We conclude that the observed cores are stable against fragmentation at this stage, due to their low angular speeds and the heat delivered at the accretion shock where the infalling material hits the disc.
astro-ph.GA:We map the three dimensional extent of the Virgo Over-density by combining distance information from RR Lyrae variables and projected spatial information from SEKBO (Keller et al. 2008) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR6 photometry. The Virgo Over-density is seen to comprise two filaments 14.5 x 3 degrees and 10 x 3 degrees and a circular structure 3 degrees in diameter. Together the three features span 38 degrees of right ascension and declinations of +2 to -15 degrees. RR Lyrae variables place the two filamentary features at heliocentric distances of 20 and 17 kpc respectively, with projected dimensions of 5 x 1 kpc and 3 x 1 kpc.
astro-ph.GA:We draw a comparison between AGN and Galactic black hole binaries using a uniform description of spectral energy distribution of these two classes of accreting X-ray sources. We parametrize spectra of GBHs with an alpha_GBH parameter which we define as a slope of a nominal power law function between 3 and 20 keV. We show that this parameter can be treated as an equivalent of the X-ray loudness, alpha_OX, used to describe AGN spectra. We do not find linear correlation between the alpha_GBH and disc flux (similar to that between alpha_OX and optical/UV luminosity found in AGN). Instead, we show that alpha_GBH follows a well defined pattern during a GBH outburst. We find that alpha_GBH tend to cluster around 1, 1.5 and 2, which correspond to a hard, very high/intermediate and soft spectral state, respectively. We conclude that majority of the observed Type 1 radio quiet AGN are in a spectral state corresponding to a very high/intermediate state of GBHs. The same conclusion is valid for radio loud AGN. We also study variations of the spectral slopes (alpha_GBH and the X-ray photon index, Gamma) as a function of disc and Comptonization fluxes. We discuss these dependencies in the context of correlations of alpha_OX and Gamma with the optical/UV and X-ray 2 keV fluxes considered for AGN and quasars.
astro-ph.GA:We have decomposed the broad H-alpha, H-beta and H-gamma lines of 90 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) into a superposition of a very broad and an intermediate Gaussian components (VBGC and IMGC) and discovered that the two Gaussian components evolve with FWHM of the whole emission lines. We suggest that the VBGC and the IMGC are produced in different emission regions, namely, Very Broad Line Region (VBLR) and Intermediate Line Region (IMLR). The details of the two components of H-alpha, H-beta and H-gamma lines indicate that the radius obtained from the emission line reverberation mapping normally corresponds to the radius of the VBLR, but the radius obtained from the infrared reverberation mapping corresponding to IMLR, i.e., the inner boundary of the dusty torus. The existence of the IMGC may affect the measurement of the black hole mass in AGNs. Therefore, the deviation of NLS1s from the M-sigma relation may be explained naturally in this way. The evolution of the two emission line regions may be related to the evolutionary stages of the broad line regions of AGNs from NLS1s to BLS1s. Other evidences for the existence of the IMLR are also presented.
astro-ph.GA:A significant fraction of high redshift starburst galaxies presents strong Ly alpha emission. Understanding the nature of these galaxies is important to assess the role they played in the early Universe and to shed light on the relation between the narrow band selected Lyalpha emitters and the Lyman break galaxies: are the Lyalpha emitters a subset of the general LBG population? or do they represent the youngest galaxies in their early phases of formation? We studied a sample of UV continuum selected galaxies from z~2.5 to z~6 (U, B, V and i-dropouts) from the GOODS-South survey, that have been observed spectroscopically. Using the GOODS-MUSIC catalog we investigated their physical properties, such as total masses, ages, SFRs, extinction etc as determined from a spectrophotometric fit to the multi-wavelength (U band to mid-IR) SEDs, and their dependence on the emission line characteristics. In particular we determined the nature of the LBGs with Lyalpha in emission and compared them to the properties of narrow band selected Lyalpha emitters. For U and B-dropouts we also compared the properties of LBGs with and without the Lyalpha emission line.
astro-ph.GA:IGR J16351-5806 has been associated with the Seyfert 2 galaxy ESO 137-G34, having been first reported as a high energy emitter in the third INTEGRAL/IBIS survey. Using a new diagnostic tool based on X-ray column density measurements vs softness ratios, Malizia et al. (2007) identified this source as a candidate Compton thick AGN. In the present work we have analysed combined XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL data of IGR J16351-5806 in order to study its broad band spectrum and investigate its Compton thick nature. The prominent K_alpha fluorescence line around 6.4 keV (EW > 1 keV) together with a flat 2-10 keV spectrum immediately point to a highly obscured source. The overall spectrum can be interpreted in terms of a transmission scenario where some of the high energy radiation is able to penetrate through the thick absorption but a good fit is also obtained using a pure reflection spectrum. An alternative possibility is that of a complex absorption, where two layers of absorbing matter each partially covering the central nucleus are present in IGR J16351-5806. All three scenarios are compatible from a statistical viewpoint and provide reasonable AGN spectral parameters; more importantly all point to a source with an absorbing column greater than 1.5 x 10^24 cm^-2, i.e. to a Compton thick AGN. Because of this heavy obscuration, some extra components which would otherwise be hidden are able to emerge at low energies and can be studied. By providing strong evidence for the Compton thick nature of IGR J16351-5806, we indirectly confirm the validity of the Malizia et al. diagnostic diagram.
astro-ph.GA:We carried out long-slit spectroscopic observations of the star forming knots along the polar ring of the dwarf galaxy IIZw71 in the spectral range 3500 - 10000 angstroms taken with the William erschel Telescope (WHT). The spectroscopic observations were complemented with available photometry of the galaxy in the narrow Halpha filter. We measured the rotation curve of the ring, from which we infer a ratio M/L_B = 3.9 inside the star forming ring. We measured the auroral [OIII] line in the two brightest knots, allowing us to measure oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, argon and neon chemical abundances following the direct method. Different empirical calibrators were used to estimate the oxygen abundance in the two faintest knots. The metallicities obtained are very similar for all the knots, but lower than previously reported in the literature from integrated spectra. The N/O abundance, as derived from the N2O2 parameter, is remarkably constant over the ring, indicating that local polution processes are not conspicuous. Using synthetic stellar populations (SSPs) calculated with the code STARLIGHT, we studied the age distribution of the stellar populations in each knot, finding that in all of them there is a combination of a very young population with less than 10 Myr, responsible for the ionisation of the gas, with other populations older than 100 Myr, probably responsible for the chemical evolution of the knots. The small differences in metallicity and the age distributions among the different knots are indicative of a common chemical evolution, probably related to the process of interaction with the companion galaxy IIZw70.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridge) Bars are very common in the centre of the disc galaxies, and they drive the evolution of their structure. A volume-limited sample of 2106 disc galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 was studied to derive the bar fraction, length, and strength as a function of the morphology, size, local galaxy density, light concentration, and colour of the host galaxy. The bars were detected using the ellipse fitting method and Fourier analysis method. The ellipse fitting method was found to be more efficient in detecting bars in spiral galaxies. The fraction of barred galaxies turned out to be 45%. A bar was found in 29% of the lenticular galaxies, in 55% and 54% of the early- and late-type spirals, respectively. The bar length (normalised by the galaxy size) of late-type spirals is shorter than in early-type or lenticular ones. A correlation between the bar length and galaxy size was found with longer bars hosted by larger galaxies. The bars of the lenticular galaxies are weaker than those in spirals. Moreover, the unimodal distribution of the bar strength found for all the galaxy types argues against a quick transition between the barred and unbarred statues. There is no difference between the local galaxy density of barred and unbarred galaxies. Besides, neither the length nor strength of the bars are correlated with the local density of the galaxy neighbourhoods. In contrast, a statistical significant difference between the central light concentration and colour of barred and unbarred galaxies was found. Bars are mostly located in less concentrated and bluer galaxies. These results indicate that the properties of bars are strongly related to those of their host galaxies, but do not depend on the local environment.
astro-ph.GA:Using H I absorption spectra taken from the recent surveys of 21-cm line and continuum emission in the Galactic plane, the distribution of cool atomic clouds in the outer disk of the Milky Way is revealed. The warp of the midplane is clearly seen in absorption, as it is in emission, and the cool, neutral medium also shows flaring or increase in scale height with radius similar to that of the warm atomic hydrogen. The mixture of phases, as measured by the fraction of H I in the cool clouds relative to the total atomic hydrogen, stays nearly constant from the solar circle out to about 25 kpc radius. Assuming cool phase temperature ~50 K this indicates a mixing ratio of 15% to 20% cool H I, with the rest warm.
astro-ph.GA:The papers in this volume represent a broad spectrum of observational, theoretical, and computational astrophysics, sharing as a unifying core the Disk-Halo Interaction in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies. This topic covers a wide range of Galactic and extra-galactic research, built on a foundation of numerous and diverse physical processes. This summary groups the papers according to six themes, with some historical background and finally a look to the future. The final message is that the astrophysical techniques discussed and reviewed at this conference will grow over the next decade to answer even more fundamental questions about galaxy evolution and the history of the universe.
astro-ph.GA:We present mid-IR observations of the Galactic Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) HR Car and its associated nebula carried out with the Spitzer Space Telescope using both IRAC and IRS, as part of a GTO program aimed to study stellar ejecta from evolved stars. Our observations reveal a rich mid-IR spectrum of the inner nebula showing both solid state and atomic gas signatures. Strong low-excitation atomic fine structure lines such as $ 26.0 \mu$m [\ion{Fe}{2}] and $ 34.8 \mu$m [\ion{Si}{2}], indicate, for the first time, the presence of a PDR in this object class. While the physics and chemistry of the low-excitation gas appears to be dominated by photodissociation, a possible contribution due to shocks can be inferred from the evidence of gas phase Fe abundance enhancement. The presence of amorphous silicates, inferred from the observed characteristic broad feature at $10 \mu$m located in the inner nebula, suggests that dust has formed during the LBV outburst. This is in contrast with the detection of crystalline dust in other probably more evolved Galactic LBVs, which is similar to the crystalline dust observed in red supergiants. This has been considered to be evidence of dust production during evolutionary phases prior to the outburst.
astro-ph.GA:We propose a methodology to perform a self-consistent analysis of the physical properties of the emitting gas of HII galaxies adequate to the data that can be obtained with the XXI century technology. This methodology requires the production and calibration of empirical relations between the different line temperatures that should superseed currently used ones based on very simple, and poorly tested, photo-ionization model sequences. Then, these observations are analysed applying a methodology designed to obtain accurate elemental abundances of oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, neon, argon and iron in the ionsied gas. Four electron temperatures and one electron density are derived from the observed forbidden line ratios using the five-level atom approximation. For our best objects errors of 1% in T([OIII]), 3% in T([OII]) and 5% in T([SIII]) are achieved with a resulting accuracy between 5 and 9% in total oxygen abundances, O/H. These accuracies are expected to improve as better calibrations based on more precise measurements, both on electron temperatures and densities, are produced.
astro-ph.GA:We performed astrometric observations with the VLBA of WB89-437, an H2O maser source in the Outer spiral arm of the Galaxy. We measure an annual parallax of 0.167 +/- 0.006 mas, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of 6.0 +/- 0.2 kpc or a Galactocentric distance of 13.4 +/- 0.2 kpc. This value for the heliocentric distance is considerably smaller than the kinematic distance of 8.6 kpc. This confirms the presence of a faint Outer arm toward l = 135 degrees. We also measured the full space motion of the object and find a large peculiar motion of ~20 km/s toward the Galactic center. This peculiar motion explains the large error in the kinematic distance estimate. We also find that WB89-437 has the same rotation speed as the LSR, providing more evidence for a flat rotation curve and thus the presence of dark matter in the outer Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:We revisit the mass ratio Rmol between molecular hydrogen (H2) and atomic hydrogen (HI) in different galaxies from a phenomenological and theoretical viewpoint. First, the local H2-mass function (MF) is estimated from the local CO-luminosity function (LF) of the FCRAO Extragalactic CO-Survey, adopting a variable CO-to-H2 conversion fitted to nearby observations. This implies an average H2-density Omega_H2=(6.9+-2.7) 10^5/h and Omega_H2/Omega_HI=0.26+-0.11 in the local Universe. Second, we investigate the correlations between Rmol and global galaxy properties in a sample of 245 local galaxies. Based on these correlations we introduce four phenomenological models for Rmol, which we apply to estimate H2-masses for each HI-galaxy in the HIPASS catalogue. The resulting H2-MFs (one for each model for Rmol) are compared to the reference H2-MF derived from the CO-LF, thus allowing us to determine the Bayesian evidence of each model and to identify a clear best model, in which, for spiral galaxies, Rmol negatively correlates with both galaxy Hubble type and total gas mass. Third, we derive a theoretical model for Rmol for regular galaxies based on an expression for their axially symmetric pressure profile dictating the degree of molecularization. This model is quantitatively similar to the best phenomenological one at redshift z=0, and hence represents a consistent generalization while providing a physical explanation for the dependence of Rmol on global galaxy properties. Applying the best phenomenological model for Rmol to the HIPASS sample, we derive the first integral cold gas-MF (HI+H2+helium) of the local Universe.
astro-ph.GA:Observations of high redshift galaxies have revealed a multitude of large clumpy rapidly star-forming galaxies. Their formation scenario and their link to present day spirals is still unknown. In this Letter we perform adaptive mesh refinement simulations of disk formation in a cosmological context that are unrivalled in terms of mass and spatial resolution. We find that the so called "chain-galaxies" and "clump-clusters" are a natural outcome of early epochs of enhanced gas accretion from cold dense streams as well as tidally and ram-pressured stripped material from minor mergers and satellites. Through interaction with the hot halo gas, this freshly accreted cold gas settles into a large disk-like system, not necessarily aligned to an older stellar component, that undergoes fragmentation and subsequent star formation, forming large clumps in the mass range 10^7-10^9 M_sun. Galaxy formation is a complex process at this important epoch when most of the central baryons are being acquired through a range of different mechanisms - we highlight that a rapid mass loading epoch is required to fuel the fragmentation taking place in the massive arms in the outskirts of extended disks, an accretion mode that occurs naturally in the hierarchical assembly process at early epochs.
astro-ph.GA:We report on the detection of a population of weak metal-line absorbers in the halo or nearby intergalactic environment of the Milky Way. Using high-resolution ultraviolet absorption-line spectra of bright QSOs obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), along six sight lines we have observed unsaturated, narrow absorption in OI and SiII together with mildly saturated CII absorption at high radial velocities (|v_LSR|=100-320 km/s). The measured OI column densities are small, implying that these structures represent Lyman-Limit Systems and sub-Lyman-Limit System with HI column densities < 3x10^18 cm^-2, thus below the detection limits of current 21cm all-sky surveys of high-velocity clouds (HVCs). The absorbers apparently are not directly associated with any of the large high-column density HVC complexes, but rather represent isolated, partly neutral gas clumps embedded in a more tenuous, ionized gaseous medium situated in the halo or nearby intergalactic environment of the Galaxy. We speculate that this absorber population represents the local analog of weak MgII systems that are commonly observed in the circumgalactic environment of low- and high-redshift galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:I review the observational constraints on the star formation histories in the spheroids of M33 and M31, the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group. M33 does not possess a traditional bulge; instead, it has a small nuclear region hosting stars with a wide range of ages. The star formation history of the M33 halo is poorly constrained, but composite spectra of its halo globular clusters imply a wide age spread of 5 - 7 years, while the presence of RR Lyrae stars in the halo implies at least some of the population is ancient. Although it is possible to obtain the detailed star formation history of the M33 halo via deep photometry, this has not been done to date. M31 hosts a traditional bulge that is apparently dominated by stars older than 10 Gyr. Deep photometry of the M31 halo demonstrates that it hosts both a population of ancient metal-poor stars and a significant population extending to younger ages and high metallicity, apparently due to its active merger history.
astro-ph.GA:The complete census of globular clusters formerly belonging to the Sgr dSph and now deposited into the Galactic halo is an important contribution to our comprehension of the evolution and disruption of this dwarf galaxy. We investigate in this study the possibility that the poorly known "old" globular AM 4 might be associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and at the same time provide more solid estimate of its basic parameters. New high quality BVI photometry is presented, from which an improved Color Ma gnitude Diagram is constructed, and estimates of age and distance are then derived. The distance and Galactic position are finally investigated in details. AM~4 is found to be a low luminosity (M$_V$=-1.82) cluster undergoing strong tidal stress by the Milky Way and on the verge to be dissolved. Besides, and at odds with previous suggestions, we provide evidences that AM 4 is indeed young, with an age around 9 Gyrs (as Terzan~7), but somewhat more metal poor ([Fe/H=-0.97]). AM~4 is located at 33$_{-4}^{+3}$ kpc from the Sun, in a direction and at distance not totally incompatible with the Sgr dSph stream. Although we significantly improved our knowledge of AM 4, further studies are encouraged to obtain radial velocity and metallicity to d emonstrate more firmly (or deny) the association to Sgr
astro-ph.GA:In this paper, a consistent model of the multifrequency emission of the starburst galaxy M82, from radio to gamma-rays is presented and discussed. Predictions for observations with Fermi, MAGIC II/VERITAS and CTA telescopes are made. The model is also used to self-consistenty compute the (all flavors) emission of neutrinos resulting from this starburst galaxy, what can be used in considerations of the diffuse contributions of such objects.
astro-ph.GA:Ram pressure stripping of the multiphase ISM is studied in the perturbed Virgo cluster spiral galaxy NGC 4438. This galaxy underwent a tidal interaction ~100 Myr ago and is now strongly affected by ram pressure stripping. Deep VLA radio continuum observations at 6 and 20 cm are presented. We detect prominent extraplanar emission to the west of the galactic center, which extends twice as far as the other tracers of extraplanar material. The spectral index of the extraplanar emission does not steepen with increasing distance from the galaxy. This implies in situ re-acceleration of relativistic electrons. The comparison with multiwavelength observations shows that the magnetic field and the warm ionized interstellar medium traced by Halpha emission are closely linked. The kinematics of the northern extraplanar Halpha emission, which is ascribed to star formation, follow those of the extraplanar CO emission. In the western and southern extraplanar regions, the Halpha measured velocities are greater than those of the CO lines. We suggest that the ionized gas of this region is excited by ram pressure. The spatial and velocity offsets are consistent with a scenario where the diffuse ionized gas is more efficiently pushed by ram pressure stripping than the neutral gas. We suggest that the recently found radio-deficient regions compared to 24 mum emission are due to this difference in stripping efficiency.
astro-ph.GA:We present an analysis of the X-ray point source populations in 182 Chandra images of galaxy clusters at z>0.1 with exposure time >10 ksec, as well as 44 non-cluster fields. Analysis of the number and flux of these sources, using a detailed pipeline to predict the distribution of non-cluster sources in each field, reveals an excess of X-ray point sources associated with the galaxy clusters. A sample of 148 galaxy clusters at 0.1<z<0.9, with no other nearby clusters, show an excess of 230 cluster sources in total, an average of ~1.5 sources per cluster. The lack of optical data for these clusters limits the physical interpretation of this result, as we cannot calculate the fraction of cluster galaxies hosting X-ray sources. However, the fluxes of the excess sources indicate that over half of them are very likely to be AGN, and the radial distribution shows that they are quite evenly distributed over the central 1 Mpc of the cluster, with almost no sources found beyond this radius. We also use this pipeline to successfully reproduce the results of previous studies, particularly the higher density of sources in the central 0.5 Mpc of a few cluster fields, but show that these conclusions are not generally valid for this larger sample of clusters. We conclude that some of these differences may be due to the sample properties, such as the size and redshift of the clusters studied, or a lack of publications for cluster fields with no excess sources. This paper also presents the basic X-ray properties of the galaxy clusters, and in subsequent papers in this series the dependence of the AGN population on these cluster properties will be evaluated.   In addition the properties of over 9500 X-ray point sources in the fields of galaxy clusters are tabulated in a separate catalogue available online.
astro-ph.GA:We report spatially-resolved variations in the 3.4micron hydrocarbon absorption feature and the 3.3micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission band in the Circinus galaxy over the central few arcsec. The absorption is measured towards warm emitting dust associated with Coronal line regions to the east and west of the nucleus. There is an absorption optical depth tau(3.4um) ~0.1 in the core which decreases to the west and increases to the east. This is consistent with increased extinction out to ~40 pc east of the core, supported by the Coronal emission line intensities which are significantly lower to the east than the west. PAH emission is measured to be symmetrically distributed out to +/- 4 arcsec, outside the differential extinction region. The asymmetry in the 3.4micron absorption band reflects that seen in the 9.7micron silicate absorption band reported by Roche et al. (2006) and the ratio of the two absorption depths remains approximately constant across the central regions, with tau(3.4um) / tau(9.7um) ~ 0.06 +/-0.01. This indicates well-mixed hydrocarbon and silicate dust populations, with no evidence for significant changes near the nucleus.
astro-ph.GA:In a programme of observations of local luminous blue compact galaxies (BCGs), we are investigating kinematics by using tracers of both stars and ionized gas. Here we summarise our program and present new data on the local Lyman break galaxy analogue Haro 11. From spatially-resolved spectroscopy around the near-infrared Ca II triplet, we find that its stars and ionized gas have similar velocity fields. Our programme so far indicates however that emission line velocities can differ locally by a few tens of km/s from the Ca II values. Comparing our data to simple stellar population models, we assess which stellar population the Ca II triplet traces and its potential beyond the local universe.
astro-ph.GA:The study of PopI and PopII indicators in galaxies has a profound impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution. Their present (z=0) ratio suggests that the star formation history of galaxies was primarily dictated by their global mass. Since 1989 Luis Carrasco and I spent most of our sleepless nights gathering H_alpha and near infrared surface photometry of galaxies in the local Universe and focused most of our scientific career on these two indicators trying to convince the community that the mass was the key parameter to their evolution. We were unsuccessful, until in 2004 the Sloan team rediscovered this phenomenon and named it "downsizing"
astro-ph.GA:Gamma-ray emission from cocoons of young radio galaxies is predicted. Considering the process of adiabatic injection of the shock dissipation energy and mass of the relativistic jet into the cocoon, we find that the thermal electron temperature of the cocoon is typically predicted to be of the order of $\sim$ MeV, and is determined only by the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet. Together with the time-dependent dynamics of the cocoon expansion, we find that young cocoons can yield thermal Bremsstrahlung emissions at energies $\sim$MeV. Hotter cocoons (i.e., GeV) for younger sources are also discussed.
astro-ph.GA:Coordinates, magnitudes and spectra are presented for 39 cataclysmic variables found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra that were primarily obtained in 2006. Of these, 12 were CVs identified prior to the SDSS spectra (GY Cnc, GO Com, ST LMi, NY Ser, MR Ser, QW Ser, EU UMa, IY UMa, HS1340+1524, RXJ1610.1+0352, Boo 1, Leo 5). Follow-up spectroscopic observations of seven systems (including one from year 2005 and another from year 2004) were obtained, resulting in estimates of the orbital periods for 3 objects. The new CVs include two candidates for high inclination, eclipsing systems, 4 new Polars and three systems whose spectra clearly reveal atmospheric absorption lines from the underlying white dwarf.
astro-ph.GA:Recent developments on the study of mixed morphology supernova remnants (MMSNRs) have revealed the presence of metal rich X-ray emitting plasma inside a fraction of these remnant, a feature not properly addressed by traditional models for these objects. Radial profiles of thermodynamical and chemical parameters are needed for a fruitful comparison of data and model of MMSNRs, but these are available only in a few cases. We analyze XMM-Newton data of two MMSNRs, namely IC443 and G166.0+4.3, previously known to have solar metal abundances, and we perform spatially resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray emission. We detected enhanced abundances of Ne, Mg and Si in the hard X-ray bright peak in the north of IC443, and of S in the outer regions of G166.0+4.3. The metal abundances are not distributed uniformly in both remnants. The evaporating clouds model and the radiative SNR model fail to reproduce consistently all the observational results. We suggest that further deep X-ray observations of MMSNRs may reveal more metal rich objects. More detailed models which include ISM-ejecta mixing are needed to explain the nature of this growing subclass of MMSNRs.
astro-ph.GA:Deep ACS slitless grism observations and identification of stellar sources are presented within the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) North and South fields which were obtained in the Probing Evolution And Reionization Spectroscopically (PEARS) program. It is demonstrated that even low resolution spectra can be a very powerful means to identify stars in the field, especially low mass stars with stellar types M0 and later. The PEARS fields lay within the larger GOODS fields, and we used new, deeper images to further refine the selection of stars in the PEARS field, down to a magnitude of mz = 25 using a newly developed stellarity parameter. The total number of stars with reliable spectroscopic and morphological identification was 95 and 108 in the north and south fields respectively. The sample of spectroscopically identified stars allows constraints to be set on the thickness of the Galactic thin disk as well as contributions from a thick disk and a halo component. We derive a thin disk scale height, as traced by the population of M4 to M9 dwarfs along two independent lines of sight, of h_thin = 370 +60/-65 pc. When including the more massive M0 to M4 dwarf population, we derive h_thin = 300 +/- 70pc. In both cases, we observe that we must include a combination of thick and halo components in our models in order to account for the observed numbers of faint dwarfs. The required thick disk scale height is typically h_thick=1000 pc and the acceptable relative stellar densities of the thin disk to thick disk and the thin disk to halo components are in the range of 0.00025<f_halo<0.0005 and 0.05<f_thick<0.08 and are somewhat dependent on whether the more massive M0 to M4 dwarfs are included in our sample.
astro-ph.GA:The Large Area Telescope on the recently launched Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST), with its large field of view and effective area, combined with its excellent timing capabilities, is poised to revolutionize the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The large improvement in sensitivity over EGRET is expected to result in the discovery of many new gamma-ray pulsars, which in turn should lead to fundamental advances in our understanding of pulsar physics and the role of neutron stars in the Galaxy. Almost immediately after launch, Fermi clearly detected all previously known gamma-ray pulsars and is producing high precision results on these. An extensive radio and X-ray timing campaign of known (primarily radio) pulsars is being carried out in order to facilitate the discovery of new gamma-ray pulsars. In addition, a highly efficient time-differencing technique is being used to conduct blind searches for radio-quiet pulsars, which has already resulted in new discoveries. I present some recent results from searches for pulsars carried out on Fermi data, both blind searches, and using contemporaneous timing of known radio pulsars.
astro-ph.GA:We observed the northern rim of the Cygnus Loop with the \textit{Suzaku} observatory in 5 pointings (P21-P25). From the spatially resolved analysis, all the spectra are well fitted by the single component of the non-equilibrium ionization plasma model. From the best-fit parameters, we found that the abundances of the heavy elements are significantly lower than the solar values except those at the outermost edge in P21 and P22. The origin of the depleted metal abundances is still unclear while such deficiencies have been reported from many other rim observations of the Loop. To explain these depletion at the rim regions, we considered the several possibilities. The effects of the resonance-line-scattering and the grain condensation lower the values of the abundances. However, these are not sufficient to account for the abundance depletion observed.   We found that the abundances at the outermost edge in P21 and P22 are higher than those at the other regions. From the morphological point of view, it is reasonable to consider that this abundance inhomogeneity is derived from the breakout or the thinness of the cavity wall of the Loop.
astro-ph.GA:We analyzed the metal distribution of the Cygnus Loop using 14 and 7 pointings observation data obtained by the \textit{Suzaku} and the \textit{XMM-Newton} observatories. The spectral analysis shows that all the spectra are well fitted by the two-$kT_e$ non-equilibrium ionization plasma model as shown by the earlier observations. From the best-fit parameters of the high-$kT_e$ component, we calculated the emission measures about various elements and showed the metal distribution of the ejecta component. We found that the distributions of Si and Fe are centered at the southwest of the geometric center toward the blow-out region. From the best-fit parameters, we also estimated the progenitor mass of the Cygnus Loop from our field of view and the metal rich region with a radius of 25 arcmin from the metal center. The result from the metal circle is similar to that from our entire FOV, which suggests the mixing of the metal. From the results, we estimated the mass of the progenitor star at 12-15\MO.
astro-ph.GA:Context. The origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of magnetic cataclysmic variables are poorly understood. It is largely the nature of the magnetic fields in these systems that leads to this poor understanding. Fundamental properties, such as the field strength and the axis alignment, are unknown in a majority of these systems. Aims. We undertake to put all the previous circular polarization measurements into context and systematically survey intermediate polars for signs of circular polarization, hence to get an indication of their true magnetic field strengths and try to understand the evolution of magnetic cataclysmic variables. Methods. We used the TurPol instrument at the Nordic Optical Telescope to obtain simultaneous UBVRI photo-polarimetric observations of a set of intermediate polars, during the epoch 2006 July 31 - August 2. Results. Of this set of eight systems two (1RXS J213344.1+510725 and 1RXS J173021.5-055933) were found to show significant levels of circular polarization, varying with spin phase. Five others (V2306 Cyg, AO Psc, DQ Her, FO Aqr, and V1223 Sgr) show some evidence for circular polarization and variation of this with spin phase, whilst AE Aqr shows little evidence for polarized emission. We also report the first simultaneous UBVRI photometry of the newly identified intermediate polar 1RXS J173021.5-055933. Conclusions. Circular polarization may be ubiquitous in intermediate polars, albeit at a low level of one or two percent or less. It is stronger at longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Our results lend further support to the possible link between the presence of soft X-ray components and the detectability of circular polarization in intermediate polars.
astro-ph.GA:White dwarf masses in cataclysmic variables are difficult to determine accurately, but are fundamental for understanding binary system parameters, as well as binary evolution. We investigate the X-ray spectral properties of a sample of Intermediate Polars detected above 15 keV to derive the masses of their accreting white dwarfs. We use data from the Swift/BAT instrument which during the first 2.5 yrs of operation has detected 22 known intermediate polars. The X-ray spectra of these sources are used to estimate the mass of the white dwarfs. We are able to produce a mass estimate for 22 out of 29 of the confirmed intermediate polars. Comparison with previous mass measurements shows good agreement. For GK Per, we were able to detect spectral changes due to the changes in the accretion rate. The Swift/BAT detector with its combination of sensitivity and all-sky coverage provides an ideal tool to determine accurate white dwarf masses in intermediate polars.
astro-ph.GA:Supersonic turbulence is a large reservoir of suprathermal energy in the interstellar medium. Its dissipation, because it is intermittent in space and time, can deeply modify the chemistry of the gas. We further explore a hybrid method to compute the chemical and thermal evolution of a magnetized dissipative structure, under the energetic constraints provided by the observed properties of turbulence in the cold neutral medium. For the first time, we model a random line of sight by taking into account the relative duration of the bursts with respect to the thermal and chemical relaxation timescales of the gas. The key parameter is the turbulent rate of strain "a" due to the ambient turbulence. With the gas density, it controls the size of the dissipative structures, therefore the strength of the burst. For a large range of rates of strain and densities, the models of turbulent dissipation regions (TDR) reproduce the CH+ column densities observed in the diffuse medium and their correlation with highly excited H2. They do so without producing an excess of CH. As a natural consequence, they reproduce the abundance ratios of HCO+/OH and HCO+/H2O, and their dynamic range of about one order of magnitude observed in diffuse gas. Large C2H and CO abundances, also related to those of HCO+, are another outcome of the TDR models that compare well with observed values. The abundances and column densities computed for CN, HCN and HNC are one order of magnitude above PDR model predictions, although still significantly smaller than observed values.
astro-ph.GA:The black hole at the Galactic Center, Sgr A*, is the prototype of a galactic nucleus at a very low level of activity. Its radio through submm-wave emission is known to come from a region close to the event horizon, however, the source of the emission is still under debate. A successful theory explaining the emission is based on a relativistic jet model scaled down from powerful quasars. We want to test the predictive power of this established jet model against newly available measurements of wavelength-dependent time lags and the size-wavelength structure in Sgr A*. Using all available closure amplitude VLBI data from different groups, we again derived the intrinsic wavelength-dependent size of Sgr A*. This allowed us to calculate the expected frequency-dependent time lags of radio flares, assuming a range of in- and outflow velocities. Moreover, we calculated the time lags expected in the previously published pressure-driven jet model. The predicted lags are then compared to radio monitoring observations at 22, 43, and 350 GHz. The combination of time lags and size measurements imply a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk outflow speeds of gamma*beta ~ 0.5-2. The newly measured time lags are reproduced well by the jet model without any major fine tuning. The results further strengthen the case for the cm-to-mm wave radio emission in Sgr A* as coming from a mildly relativistic jet-like outflow. The combination of radio time lag and VLBI closure amplitude measurements is a powerful new tool for assessing the flow speed and direction in Sgr A*. Future VLBI and time lag measurements over a range of wavelengths will reveal more information about Sgr A*, such as the existence of a jet nozzle, and measure the detailed velocity structure of a relativistic jet near its launching point for the first time.
astro-ph.GA:High-dynamic-range surface photometry in a companion paper makes possible accurate measurement of the stellar light deficits L_def and mass deficits M_def associated with the cores of elliptical galaxies. We show that L_def correlates with the velocity dispersion sigma of the host galaxy bulge averaged outside the central region that may be affected by a supermassive black hole (BH). We confirm that L_def correlates with BH mass MBH. Also, the fractional light deficit L_def/L correlates with MBH/M, the ratio of BH mass to the galaxy stellar mass. All three correlations have scatter similar to or smaller than the scatter in the well known correlation between MBH and sigma. The new correlations are remarkable in view of the dichotomy between ellipticals with cores and those with central extra light. Core light deficit correlates closely with MBH and sigma, but extra light does not. This supports the suggestion that extra light Es are made in wet mergers with starbursts whereas core Es are made in dry mergers. After dry mergers, cores are believed to be scoured by BH binaries that fling stars away as their orbits decay or by BHs that sink back to the center after recoiling from anisotropic gravitational radiation emitted when they merge. Direct evidence has been elusive. We interpret the new correlations as the "smoking gun" that connects cores with BHs. Together, the MBH - sigma and MBH - L_def correlations give us two independent ways to estimate BH masses in core ellipticals.
astro-ph.GA:We identify SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, a QSO discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, as a promising candidate for a binary black hole system. This QSO has two broad-line emission systems separated by 3500 km/sec. The redder system at z=0.3889 also has a typical set of narrow forbidden lines. The bluer system (z=0.3727) shows only broad Balmer lines and UV Fe II emission, making it highly unusual in its lack of narrow lines. A third system, which includes only unresolved absorption lines, is seen at a redshift, z=0.3878, intermediate between the two emission-line systems. While the observational signatures of binary nuclear black holes remain unclear, J1536+0441 is unique among all QSOs known in having two broad-line regions, indicative of two separate black holes presently accreting gas. The interpretation of this as a bound binary system of two black holes having masses of 10^8.9 and 10^7.3 solar masses, yields a separation of ~ 0.1 parsec and an orbital period of ~100 years. The separation implies that the two black holes are orbiting within a single narrow-line region, consistent with the characteristics of the spectrum. This object was identified as an extreme outlier of a Karhunen-Loeve Transform of 17,500 z < 0.7 QSO spectra from the SDSS. The probability of the spectrum resulting from a chance superposition of two QSOs with similar redshifts is estimated at 2X10^-7, leading to the expectation of 0.003 such objects in the sample studied; however, even in this case, the spectrum of the lower redshift QSO remains highly unusual.
astro-ph.GA:We use velocity and metallicity information from SDSS and SEGUE stellar spectroscopy to fit an orbit to the narrow $63^\circ$ stellar stream of Grillmair and Dionatos. The stars in the stream have a retrograde orbit with eccentricity $e = 0.33$ (perigalacticon of 14.4 kpc and apogalacticon of 28.7 kpc) and inclination approximately $i \sim 35^\circ$. In the region of the orbit which is detected, it has a distance of about 7 to 11 kpc from the Sun. Assuming a standard disk plus bulge and logarithmic halo potential for the Milky Way stars plus dark matter, the stream stars are moving with a large space velocity of approximately $276 \rm km s^{-1}$ at perigalacticon. Using this stream alone, we are unable to determine if the dark matter halo is oblate or prolate. The metallicity of the stream is [Fe/H] $= -2.1\pm0.1$. Observed proper motions for individual stream members above the main sequence turnoff are consistent with the derived orbit. None of the known globular clusters in the Milky Way have positions, radial velocities, and metallicities that are consistent with being the progenitor of the GD-1 stream.
astro-ph.GA:We study the polarization properties of relativistic reconfinement shocks with chaotic magnetic fields. Using our hydrodynamical model of their structure, we calculate synthetic polarization maps, longitudinal polarization profiles and discuss the spatially averaged polarization degree as a function of jet half-opening angle Theta_j, jet Lorentz factor Gamma_j and observer inclination angle to the jet axis theta_{obs}. We find, that for theta_{obs} <= Theta_j the wave electric vectors are parallel in the vicinity of the structure ends and perpendicular in between, while for theta_{obs} > Theta_j the polarization can only be perpendicular. The spatially averaged polarization degree does not exceed 30%. Parallel average polarization, with polarization degrees lower than 10%, have been found for theta_{obs} < Theta_j under the condition Gamma_j * Theta_j > 1. As earlier works predicted the parallel polarization from relativistic conical shocks, we explain our results by discussing conical shocks with divergent upstream flow.
astro-ph.GA:Two compact HI clouds which seem to belong to the Ophiuchus superbubble were studied at ~30" resolution using the Very Large Array (VLA) in C and D configurations together with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) providing the short-spacing flux. Here we present preliminary results of the data analysis.
astro-ph.GA:We present Submillimeter Array observations toward the 10^{4.7} Lsun star-forming region G240.31+0.07, in the J=2-1 transition of 12CO and 13CO and at 1.3 mm continuum, as well as the 12CO and 13CO observations from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory to recover the extended emission filtered out by the interferometer. Maps of the 12CO and 13CO emission show a bipolar, wide-angle, quasi-parabolic molecular outflow, roughly coincident with an IR nebula revealed by the Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micron emission. The outflow has ~98 Msun molecular gas, making it one of the most massive molecular outflows known, and resulting in a very high mass-loss rate of 4.1 by 10^{-3} Msun yr^{-1} over a dynamical timescale of 2.4 by 10^4 yr. The 1.3 mm continuum observations with a 4" by 3" beam reveal a flattened dusty envelope of ~150 Msun, which is further resolved with a 1.2" by 1" beam into three dense cores with a total mass of ~40 Msun. The central mm core, showing evidence of active star formation, approximately coincides with the geometric center of the bipolar outflow thus most likely harbors the powering source of the outflow. Overall our observations provide the best case to date of a well-defined wide-angle molecular outflow in a >10^4 Lsun star-forming region. The outflow is morphologically and kinematically similar to low-mass protostellar outflows but has two to three orders of magnitude greater mass, momentum, and energy, and is apparently driven by an underlying wide-angle wind, hence further supports that high-mass stars up to late-O types, even in a crowded clustering environment, can form as a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation.
astro-ph.GA:Thin accretion discs around massive compact objects can support slow pressure modes of oscillations in the linear regime that have azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$. We consider finite, flat discs composed of barotropic fluid for various surface density profiles and demonstrate--through WKB analysis and numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem--that these modes are stable and have spatial scales comparable to the size of the disc. We show that the eigenvalue equation can be mapped to a Schr\"odinger-like equation. Analysis of this equation shows that all eigenmodes have discrete spectra. We find that all the models we have considered support negative frequency eigenmodes; however, the positive eigenfrequency modes are only present in power law discs, albeit for physically uninteresting values of the power law index $\beta$ and barotropic index $\gamma$.
astro-ph.GA:We aim to study the structure, dynamics and physical conditions of Gomez's Hamburger (IRAS 18059-3211; GoHam). We confirm that GoHam essentially consists of a flaring disk in keplerian rotation around a young, probably pre-MS star. We present high resolution SMA maps of 12CO J=2-1, 13CO J=2-1, 12CO J=3-2, and C17O J=3-2, as well as data on 12CO J=6-5 and the continuum flux at these wavelengths. Spatial resolutions up to 1" are obtained. Except for the C17O data, the dynamical ranges are larger than 10. The maps are compared to a numerical model, which simulates the emission of a rotating disk with the expected general properties of such objects; a very satisfactory fitting of our maps is obtained. The meaning and reliability of our results are thoroughly discussed. Our observations allow measurement of the main properties of GoHam at scales between ~ 1" (~ 5 10^15 cm, for the assumed distance, 300 pc) and the total extent of the nebula, 14". We are able to measure the global structure of the gas-rich disk, which is found to be flaring, and its dynamics, which is clearly dominated by keplerian rotation, with a very small degree of turbulence. The combination of different lines, particularly showing different opacities, allows us to reasonably estimate the distributions of the gas temperature and density. We clearly find a significant and sharp increase in temperature at large distances from the equator, accompanied by a decrease in density of the same order. Finally, we identify and study a condensation in the southern part of the disk that has no counterparts in the rest of the nebula. This condensation is quite extended (about 5 10^15 cm), contains a significant amount of mass (roughly, ~ 6 10^-3 Mo), and seems to be associated with a detectable distortion of the global rotation kinematics.
astro-ph.GA:We present a study of the X-ray properties of a sample of six nearby late-type spiral galaxies based on XMM-Newton observations. Since our primary focus is on the linkage between X-ray emission and star formation in extended, extranuclear galactic disks, we have selected galaxies with near face-on aspect and sufficient angular extent so as to be readily amenable to investigation with the moderate spatial resolution afforded by XMM-Newton. After excluding regions in each galaxy dominated by bright point sources, we study both the morphology and spectral properties of the residual X-ray emission, comprised of both diffuse emission and the integrated signal of the fainter discrete source populations. The soft X-ray morphology generally traces the inner spiral arms and shows a strong correlation with the distribution of UV light, indicative of a close connection between the X-ray emission and recent star formation. The soft (0.3-2 keV) X-ray luminosity to star formation rate (SFR) ratio varies from 1-5 x 10^39 erg/s(/Msun/yr), with an indication that the lower range of this ratio relates to regions of lower SFR density. The X-ray spectra are well matched by a two-temperature thermal model with derived temperatures of typically ~0.2 keV and ~0.65 keV, in line with published results for other normal and star-forming galaxies. The hot component contributes a higher fraction of the soft luminosity in the galaxies with highest X-ray/SFR ratio, suggesting a link between plasma temperature and X-ray production efficiency. The physical properties of the gas present in the galactic disks are consistent with a clumpy thin-disk distribution, presumably composed of diffuse structures such as superbubbles together with the integrated emission of unresolved discrete sources including young supernova remnants.
astro-ph.GA:We present preliminary results from the highest available signal-to-noise rest-frame 2-8um spectra of z~2 ULIRGs. Our 10 targets are selected for their deep silicate absorption features based on previous shallower IRS spectra. The goal of this follow-up program is: 1) allow for a more accurate analysis of inner/hot dust continuum, 2) detecting the 3.3um and 6.2um PAH features, and 3) detecting molecular absorption features such as due to water ice and hydrocarbons (HACs). We find that the 3.4um HAC absorption feature is observed in four sources, while the 3.05um water ice feature is observed in three of the sources. The HAC detectability is higher and ice detectability lower than expected from local ULIRGs, but consistent with a more AGN-dominated sample such as this one. Where ice is detected, the ice-to-silicate ratio is somewhat lower than many local ULIRGs implying on average thinner ice mantles. One source shows the, to our knowledge, highest redshift reported detection of the 3.3um PAH feature (along with a previously detected 6.2um feature). The strength of the 3.3um feature is as expected for a starburst-dominated ULIRG.
astro-ph.GA:We compare the metallicities in high-redshift quasars to the star formation rates (SFR) in their host galaxies using measurements of broad emission lines and far-infrared (FIR) luminosities. The FIR emission indicates the level of ongoing massive starbursts in the galaxy, whereas the abundance of metals in the gas surrounding the quasar indicates the amount of star formation which occurred before the visible quasar phase began. The results of this study can be used to constrain the late stages of starburst-quasar evolution. We detect high metallicities throughout the sample, up to several times solar, confirming that star formation must have begun before the visible quasar phase. However, we do not detect a trend in metallicity versus current SFR.
astro-ph.GA:We present results of deep echelle spectrophotometry of the brightest knot of the HH202 in the Orion Nebula --HH202-S-- using the ultraviolet Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES). The high spectral resolution has permitted to separate the component associated with the ambient gas from that associated with the gas flow. We derive electron densities and temperatures for both components, as well as the chemical abundances of several ions and elements from collisionally excited lines, including the first determinations of Ca^{+} and Cr^{+} abundances in the Orion Nebula. We also calculate the He^{+}, C^{2+}, O^{+} and O^{2+} abundances from recombination lines. The difference between the O^{2+} abundances determined from collisionally excited and recombination lines --the so-called abundance discrepancy factor-- is 0.35 dex and 0.11 dex for the shock and nebular components, respectively. Assuming that the abundance discrepancy is produced by spatial variations in the electron temperature, we derive values of the temperature fluctuation parameter, t^2, of 0.050 and 0.016, for the shock and nebular components, respectively. Interestingly, we obtain almost coincident t^2 values for both components from the analysis of the intensity ratios of He I lines. We find significant departures from case B predictions in the Balmer and Paschen flux ratios of lines of high principal quantum number n. We analyze the ionization structure of HH202-S, finding enough evidence to conclude that the flow of HH202-S has compressed the ambient gas inside the nebula trapping the ionization front. We measure a strong increase of the total abundances of nickel and iron in the shock component, the abundance pattern and the results of photoionization models for both components are consistent with the partial destruction of dust after the passage of the shock wave in HH202-S.
astro-ph.GA:Although the stellar initial mass function (IMF) has only been directly determined in star clusters it has been manifoldly applied on galaxy-wide scales. But taking the clustered nature of star formation into account the galaxy-wide IMF is constructed by adding all IMFs of all young star clusters leading to an integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF). The IGIMF is top-light compared to the canonical IMF in star clusters and steepens with decreasing total star formation rate (SFR). This discrepancy is marginal for large disk galaxies but becomes significant for SMC-type galaxies and less massive ones. We here construct IGIMF-based relations between the total FUV and NUV luminosities of galaxies and the underlying SFR. We make the prediction that the Halpha luminosity of star forming dwarf galaxies decreases faster with decreasing SFR than the UV luminosity. This turn-down of the Halpha-UV flux ratio should be evident below total SFRs of 10^-2 M_sun/yr.
astro-ph.GA:Recent work has produced a wealth of data concerning the chemical evolution of the galactic bulge, both for stars and nebulae. Present theoretical models generally adopt a limited range of such constraints, frequently using a single chemical element (usually iron), which is not enough to describe it unambiguously. In this work, we take into account constraints involving as many chemical elements as possible, basically obtained from bulge nebulae and stars. Our main goal is to show that different scenarios can describe, at least partially, the abundance distribution and several distance-independent correlationss for these objects. Three classes of models were developed. The first is a one-zone, single-infall model, the second is a one-zone, double-infall model and the third is a multizone, double infall model. We show that a one-zone model with a single infall episode is able to reproduce some of the observational data, but the best results are achieved using a multizone, double infall model.
astro-ph.GA:We discuss whether the Gaussian is a reasonable approximation of the velocity distribution of stellar systems that are not spherically distributed. By using a non-Gaussian velocity distribution to describe the sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we reinvestigate the expected microlensing parameters of a lens population isotropically distributed either in the Milky Way halo or in the LMC (self lensing). We compare our estimates with the experimental results of the MACHO collaboration. An interesting result that emerges from our analysis is that, moving from the Gaussian to the non-Gaussian case, we do not observe any change in the form of the distribution curves describing the rate of microlensing events for lenses in the Galactic halo. The corresponding expected timescales and number of expected events also do not vary. Conversely, with respect to the self-lensing case, we observe a moderate increase in the rate and number of expected events. We conclude that the error in the estimate of the most likely value for the MACHO mass and the Galactic halo fraction in form of MACHOs, calculated with a Gaussian velocity distribution for the LMC sources, is not higher than 2%.
astro-ph.GA:In this paper we show results of numerical simulations for the turbulence in the interstellar medium. These results were obtained using a Riemann solver-free numerical scheme for high-Mach number hyperbolic equations. Here we especially concentrate on the physical properties of the ISM. That is, we do not present turbulence simulations trimmed to be applicable to the interstellar medium. The simulations are rather based on physical estimates for the relevant parameters of the interstellar gas.   Applying our code to simulate the turbulent plasma motion within a typical interstellar molecular cloud, we investigate the influence of different equations of state (isothermal and adiabatic) on the statistical properties of the resulting turbulent structures. We find slightly different density power spectra and dispersion maps, while both cases yield qualitatively similar dissipative structures, and exhibit a departure from the classical Kolmogorov case towards a scaling described by the She-Leveque model.   Solving the full energy equation with realistic heating/cooling terms appropriate for the diffuse interstellar gas, we are able to reproduce a realistic two-phase distribution of cold and warm plasma. When extracting maps of polarised intensity from our simulation data, we find encouraging similarity to actual observations. Finally, we compare the actual magnetic field strength of our simulations to its value inferred from the rotation measure. We find these to be systematically different by a factor of about 1.5, thus highlighting the often underestimated influence of varying line-of-sight particle densities on the magnetic field strength derived from observed rotation measures.
astro-ph.GA:Preliminary results are presented about a fully self-consistent N-body simulation of a sample of four massive globular clusters in close interaction within the central region of a galaxy. The N-body representation (with N=1.5x10^6 particles in total) of both the clusters and the galaxy allows to include in a natural and self-consistent way dynamical friction and tidal interactions. The results confirm the decay and merging of globulars as a viable scenario for the formation/accretion of compact nuclear clusters. Specifically: i) the frictional orbital decay is about 2 times faster than that predicted by the generalized Chandrasekhar formula; ii) the progenitor clusters merge in less than 20 galactic core-crossing times; iii) the NC configuration keeps quasi-stable at least within 70 galactic core-crossing times.
astro-ph.GA:We present a study of outflow and feedback in the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy Markarian 573 using high angular resolution long-slit spectrophotometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Through analysis of the kinematics and ionization state of a biconical outflow region emanating from the nucleus, we find that the outflow does not significantly accelerate the surrounding host-galaxy interstellar gas and is too weak to be a strong ionization mechanism in the extended emission regions. Instead, the excitation of the extended regions is consistent with photoionization by the active nucleus. From energetics arguments we show that the nuclear outflow is slow and heavy and has a mechanical luminosity that is only ~1% of the estimated bolometric luminosity of the system. The energy in the outflow is able to mildly shape the gas in the extended regions but appears to be insufficient to unbind it, or even to plausibly disrupt star formation. These results are at odds with the picture of strong AGN feedback that has been invoked to explain certain aspects of galaxy evolution.
astro-ph.GA:N-body simulations show that "box-shaped bulges" of edge-on galaxies are not bulges at all: they are bars seen side-on. The two components that we readily see in edge-on Sb galaxies like NGC 4565 are a disk and a bar, but face-on SBb galaxies always show a disk, a bar, and a (pseudo)bulge. Where is the (pseudo)bulge in NGC 4565? We use archival Hubble Space Telescope K-band and Spitzer Space Telescope 3.6 um images to penetrate the dust in NGC 4565. We find a high surface brightness, central stellar component, distinct from the boxy bar and from the galaxy's disk. Its minor-axis profile has a Sersic index of 1.33+/-0.12, so it is a pseudobulge. The pseudobulge has the smallest scale height (~90 pc) of any component in the galaxy, in contrast to ~740 pc for the boxy bar plus thin disk. The disky pseudobulge is also much less luminous than the boxy bar, so the true (pseudo)bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the galaxy is much less than previously thought. We infer that the pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratios of edge-on galaxies with box-shaped bulges have generally been overestimated. Therefore more galaxies than we have recognized contain little or no evidence of a merger-built classical bulge. This challenges our picture of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering, because it is difficult to grow big galaxies without also making a big classical bulge. Solving the puzzle of the "missing pseudobulge" in NGC 4565 further increases our confidence that we understand box-shaped bulges correctly as edge-on bars. This supports our developing picture of the formation of pseudobulges -- both edge-on bars and disky central components -- by secular evolution in isolated galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:[Abridged] We present Gemini-N GMOS-IFU observations of the central starburst clumps and inner wind of M82, together with WIYN DensePak IFU observations of the inner 2x0.9kpc of the disk. These cover the emission lines of H$\alpha$, [NII], [SII], and [SIII]. We were able to accurately decompose the emission line profiles into multiple narrow components (FWHM~30-130kms) superimposed on a broad (FWHM 150-350kms) feature. This paper is the first of a series examining the optical structure of M82's disk and inner wind; here we focus on the ionized gaseous and stellar dynamics and present maps of the relevant emission line properties.   Our observations show that ionized gas in the starburst core of M82 is dynamically complex. Localised line splitting of up to 100kms in the narrow component is associated with expanding shells of compressed, cool, photoionized gas. We have been able to associate some of this inner-wind gas with a distinct outflow channel characterised by its dynamics and gas density patterns, and we discuss the consequences of this discovery in terms of the developing wind outflow.   The broad optical emission line component is observed to become increasingly important moving outward along the outflow channel, and in general with increasing height above/below the plane. Following our recent work on the origins of this component, we associate it with turbulent gas in wind-clump interface layers and hence sites of mass loading, meaning that the turbulent mixing of cooler gas into the outflowing hot gas must become increasingly important with height, and provides powerful direct evidence for the existence of mass-loading over a large, spatially extended area.
astro-ph.GA:Adequate modelling of the multiphase interstellar medium requires optically thin radiative cooling, comprising an inherent thermal instability. The size of the occurring condensation and evaporation interfaces is determined by the so-called Field-length, which gives the dimension at which the instability is significantly damped by thermal conduction. Our aim is to study the relevance of conduction scale effects in the numerical modelling of a bistable medium and check the applicability of conventional and alternative adaptive mesh techniques. The low physical value of the thermal conduction within the ISM defines a multiscale problem, hence promoting the use of adaptive meshes. We here introduce a new refinement strategy that applies the Field condition by Koyama & Inutsuka as a refinement criterion. The described method is very similar to the Jeans criterion for gravitational instability by Truelove and efficiently allows to trace the unstable gas situated at the thermal interfaces. We present test computations that demonstrate the greater accuracy of the newly proposed refinement criterion in comparison to refinement based on the local density gradient. Apart from its usefulness as a refinement trigger, we do not find evidence in favour of the Field criterion as a prerequisite for numerical stability.
astro-ph.GA:Stellar feedback in galactic bulges plays an essential role in shaping the evolution of galaxies. To quantify this role and facilitate comparisons with X-ray observations, we conduct 3D hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive mesh refinement code, FLASH, to investigate the physical properties of hot gas inside a galactic bulge, similar to that of our Galaxy or M31. We assume that the dynamical and thermal properties of the hot gas are dominated by mechanical energy input from SNe, primarily Type Ia, and mass injection from evolved stars as well as iron enrichment from SNe. We study the bulge-wide outflow as well as the SN heating on scales down to ~4 pc. An embedding scheme that is devised to plant individual SNR seeds, allows to examine, for the first time, the effect of sporadic SNe on the density, temperature, and iron ejecta distribution of the hot gas as well as the resultant X-ray morphology and spectrum. We find that the SNe produce a bulge wind with highly filamentary density structures and patchy ejecta. Compared with a 1D spherical wind model, the non-uniformity of simulated gas density, temperature, and metallicity substantially alters the spectral shape and increases the diffuse X-ray luminosity. The differential emission measure as a function of temperature of the simulated gas exhibits a log-normal distribution, with a peak value much lower than that of the corresponding 1D model. The bulk of the X-ray emission comes from the relatively low temperature and low abundance gas shells associated with SN blastwaves. SN ejecta are not well mixed with the ambient medium, at least in the bulge region. These results, at least partly, account for the apparent lack of evidence for iron enrichment in the soft X-ray-emitting gas in galactic bulges and intermediate-mass elliptical galaxies.[...]
astro-ph.GA:During a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have discovered a pair of young brown dwarfs, FU Tau A and B, in the Barnard 215 dark cloud. They have a projected angular separation of 5.7", corresponding to 800 AU at the distance of Taurus. To assess the nature of these two objects, we have obtained spectra of them and have constructed their spectral energy distributions. Both sources are young (~1 Myr) according to their Halpha emission, gravity-sensitive spectral features, and mid-IR excess emission. The proper motion of FU Tau A provides additional evidence of its membership in Taurus. We measure spectral types of M7.25 and M9.25 for FU Tau A and B, respectively, which correspond to masses of ~0.05 and ~0.015 M\cdot according to the evolutionary models of Chabrier and Baraffe. FU Tau A is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone passing through FU Tau B and relative to other members of Taurus near its spectral type, which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary. FU Tau A and B are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability (~3x10^-4) that Taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a projected separation of a </- 6". Barnard 215 contains only one other young star and is in a remote area of Taurus, making FU Tau A and B the first spectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather than in a stellar cluster or aggregate. Because they were born in isolation and comprise a weakly bound binary, dynamical interactions with stars could not have played a role in their formation, and thus are not essential for the birth of brown dwarfs. ERRATUM: The K-band magnitude for FU Tau B in Table 1 is incorrect and should be 13.33. The bolometric luminosity of FU Tau B in Table 3 and Figure 5 is incorrect because of that mistake and a separate arithmetic error. The correct value of the luminosity is 0.0039 Lsun. FU Tau A and B exhibited different isochronal ages in the original Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in Figure 5, which was unexpected for members of a binary system. This discrepancy is reduced in the corrected version of Figure 5 since both objects are now above the isochrone for 1 Myr. Given the large uncertainties in model isochrones at such young ages, the positions of FU Tau A and B in Figure 5 could be roughly consistent with coevality.
astro-ph.GA:Barium is a key element in constraining the evolution of the (not well understood) r-process in the first galactic stars and currently the Ba abundances in these very metal-poor stars were mostly measured under the Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (LTE) assumption, which may lead in general to an underestimation of Ba. We present here determinations of the barium abundance taking into account the non-LTE (NLTE) effects in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars (EMP stars): 6 turnoff stars and 35 giants. The NLTE profiles of the three unblended Ba II lines (455.4, 585.3, 649.6nm) have been computed. The computations were made with a modified version of the MULTI code, applied to an atomic model of the Ba atom with 31 levels of Ba I, 101 levels of Ba II, and compared to the observations. The ratios of the NLTE abundances of barium relative to Fe are slightly shifted towards the solar ratio. In the plot of [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H], the slope of the regression line is slightly reduced as is the scatter. In the interval -3.3 <[Fe/H] < -2.6, [Ba/Fe] decreases with a slope of about 1.4 and a scatter close to 0.44. For [Fe/H] <-3.3 the number of stars is not sufficient to decide whether [Ba/Fe] keeps decreasing (and then CD-38:245 should be considered as a peculiar "barium-rich star") or if a plateau is reached as soon as [Ba/Fe] ~ -1. In both cases the scatter remains quite large, larger than what can be accounted for by the measurement and determination errors, suggesting the influence of a complex process of Ba production, and/or inefficient mixing in the early Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:Optical studies of starbursts, AGN and their connections usually leave out galaxies whose emission lines are too weak to warrant reliable measurement and classification. Yet, weak line galaxies abound, and deserve a closer look. We show that these galaxies are either massive, metal rich star-forming systems, or, more often, LINERs. From our detailed stellar population analysis, we find that these LINERs have stopped forming stars long ago. Moreover, their ionizing radiation field is amazingly consistent with that expected from their old stellar populations alone. The black-hole in the centers of these massive, early-type galaxies is not active enough to overwhelm stellar ionization, and thus, despite their looks, they should not be called AGN.
astro-ph.GA:Galaxies are usually classified as star forming or active by using diagnostic diagrams, such as [N II]/Halpha vs. [O III]/Hbeta. Active galaxies are further classified into Seyfert or LINER-like sources. We claim that a non-negligible fraction of galaxies classified as LINERs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are in fact ionized by hot post-AGB stars and white dwarfs.
astro-ph.GA:The runaway star HD34078, initially selected to investigate small scale structure in a foreground diffuse cloud has been shown to be surrounded by highly excited H2. We first search for an association between the foreground cloud and HD34078. Second, we extend previous investigations of temporal absorption line variations (CH, CH+, H2) in order to better characterize them. We have mapped the CO(2-1) emission at 12 arcsec resolution around HD34078's position, using the 30 m IRAM antenna. The follow-up of CH and CH+ absorption lines has been extended over 5 more years. In parallel, CH absorption towards the reddened star Zeta Per have been monitored to check the homogeneity of our measurements. Three more FUSE spectra have been obtained to search for N(H2) variations. CO observations show a pronounced maximum near HD34078's position, clearly indicating that the star and diffuse cloud are associated. The optical spectra confirm the reality of strong, rapid and correlated CH and CH+ fluctuations. On the other hand, N(H2, J=0) has varied by less than 5 % over 4 years. We also discard N(CH) variations towards Zeta Per at scales less than 20 AU. Observational constraints from this work and from 24 micron dust emission appear to be consistent with H2 excitation but inconsistent with steady-state bow shock models and rather suggest that the shell of compressed gas surrounding HD34078, is seen at an early stage of the interaction. The CH and CH+ time variations as well as their large abundances are likely due to chemical structure in the shocked gas layer located at the stellar wind/ambient cloud interface. Finally, the lack of variations for both N(H2, J=0) towards HD34078 and N(CH) towards Zeta Per suggests that quiescent molecular gas is not subject to pronounced small-scale structure.
astro-ph.GA:Cool subdwarfs of types K and M are the fainter counterparts of cool main sequence dwarfs that dominate the Galactic population. In this paper we present the results of an optical speckle survey of 62 confirmed cool subdwarf systems within 60 pc. We have resolved two new companions and confirmed two previously known companions with separations 0\farcs13 to 3\farcs29. After including previously known wide companions and all known spectroscopic binaries, we determine the multiplicity rate of cool subdwarfs to be 26$\pm$6%, which is somewhat lower than comparable main sequence stars, which have a multiplicity rate of 37$\pm$5%. We find that only 3% of the cool subdwarfs surveyed have companions within 10 AU, 3% have companions between 10 and 100 AU, and 14% have companions beyond 100 AU. The other 6% of cool subdwarfs are spectroscopic binaries. This is very different from K/M dwarfs that have most companions (13%) at separations closer than 10 AU. However, because a search for close binaries among a large sample of nearby cool subdwarfs remains elusive, it is not yet settled whether or not the multiplicity rates are significantly different. Nonetheless, several different observational results and theories pointing to a possible dearth of subdwarf multiples are discussed.
astro-ph.GA:There is a large observational scatter toward low velocities in the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation if disturbed and compact objects are included. However, this scatter can be eliminated if one replaces rotation velocity with $\rm S_{\rm 0.5}$, a quantity that includes a velocity dispersion term added in quadrature with the rotation velocity. In this work we use a large suite of hydrodynamic N-body galaxy merger simulations to explore a possible mechanism for creating the observed relations. Using mock observations of the simulations, we test for the presence of observational effects and explore the relationship between $\rm S_{\rm 0.5}$ and intrinsic properties of the galaxies. We find that galaxy mergers can explain the scatter in the TF as well as the tight $\rm S_{\rm 0.5}$-stellar mass relation. Furthermore, $\rm S_{\rm 0.5}$ is correlated with the total central mass of a galaxy, including contributions due to dark matter.
astro-ph.GA:We propose a new chemical evolution model aimed at explaining the chemical properties of globular clusters (GC) stars. Our model depends upon the existence of (i) a peculiar pre-enrichment phase in the GC's parent galaxy associated with very low-metallicity Type II supernovae (SNeII), and (ii) localized inhomogeneous enrichment from a single Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) and intermediate-mass (4 7Msun) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) field stars. GC formation is then assumed to take place within this chemically-peculiar region. Thus, in our model the first low-mass GC stars to form are those with peculiar abundances (i.e., O-depleted and Na-enhanced) while ``normal'' stars (i.e., O-rich and Na depleted) are formed in a second stage when self-pollution from SNeII occurs and the peculiar pollution from the previous phase is dispersed. In this study, we focus on three different GCs: NGC6752, NGC6205 (M13) and NGC2808. We demonstrate that, within this framework, a model can be constructed which is consistent with (i) the elemental abundance anti-correlations, (ii) isotopic abundance patterns, and (iii) the extreme [O/Fe] values observed in NGC2808 and M13, without violating the global constraints of approximately unimodal [Fe/H] and C+N+O.
astro-ph.GA:We present high resolution (R = 75,000-100,000) mid-infrared spectra of the high-mass embedded young star IRS 1 in the NGC 7538 star-forming region. Absorption lines from many rotational states of C2H2, 13C12CH2, CH3, CH4, NH3, HCN, HNCO, and CS are seen. The gas temperature, column density, covering factor, line width, and Doppler shift for each molecule are derived. All molecules were fit with two velocity components between -54 and -63 km/s. We find high column densities (~ 10e16 cm^2) for all the observed molecules compared to values previously reported and present new results for CH3 and HNCO. Several physical and chemical models are considered. The favored model involves a nearly edge-on disk around a massive star. Radiation from dust in the inner disk passes through the disk atmosphere, where large molecular column densities can produce the observed absorption line spectrum.
astro-ph.GA:We present accurate trigonometric parallaxes for 20 new members of the 25 pc white dwarf sample as part of the DENSE project (Discovery and Evalution of Nearby Stellar Embers, http://www.DenseProject.com). Previously, there were a total of 112 white dwarf systems with trigonometric parallaxes placing them within 25 pc and of these, 99 have trigonometric parallaxes known to better than 10%. Thus, the 20 new members presented in this work represent a 20% increase in the number of white dwarfs accurately known to be within 25 pc. In addition, we present updated parallaxes for seven known white dwarfs within 10 pc that have been observed as part of the ASPENS initiative (Astrometric Search for Planets Encircling Nearby Stars) to monitor nearby southern red and white dwarfs for astrometric perturbations from unseen companions. Including a few white dwarf companions and white dwarfs beyond 25 pc, we present a total of 33 trigonometric parallaxes. We perform atmospheric modeling for white dwarfs to determine physical parameters (i.e., effective temperature, log g, mass, and white dwarf age). Finally, a new ZZ Ceti pulsating white dwarf was identified and revised constraints are placed on two mixed H/He atmosphere cool white dwarfs that display continuum absorption in the near-infrared.
astro-ph.GA:Polarisation measurements of pulsars and of their pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are uniquely able to provide deep insights into the highly magnetised relativistic environment of young, rotation-powered isolated neutron stars (INSs). Besides the radio band, optical observations are primarily suited to providing such insights. The first INS for which optical polarisation observations were performed is the Crab pulsar which is also the brightest one (V=16.5). For this reason, the Crab pulsar is also the only INS for which repeated, phase-resolved polarisation measurements have been performed through the years. Moreover, it is the only case, together with the much fainter and distant PSR B0540-69 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), of an optical pulsar embedded in an optical PWN. Thus, the Crab is a perfect test case to study the optical polarisation properties of pulsars and of their PWNe. In this paper, we review the polarisation properties of the Crab pulsar and of its PWN in the optical and ultraviolet domains, we summarise the state of the art of the polarisation observations of other INSs, and we outline perspectives for INS polarisation studies with present and future generations of optical telescopes
astro-ph.GA:We investigate whether the formation mechanism of boxy and peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulges could depend on the gas content of the galaxy. We have performed N-body simulations with and without a gaseous component. In the second case star formation/feedback recipes have also been implemented to create new stellar populations. As in many previous studies, in our N-body collisionless simulation, the B/PS is due to the classical break in the z mirror symmetry lasting roughly 200 Myr. When a gaseous component and star formation recipes are added to the simulation, the bulge-growing mechanism is quite different. The young stellar population that is born in the thin gaseous disc rapidly populates vertical resonant orbits triggered by the combined effects of the linear horizontal and vertical ILRs. This leads to a B/PS bulge mainly made of stellar material younger than the surrounding population. The non-linear analysis of the orbital structure shows that the main orbit family responsible for the B/PS is not the same in the two cases. The 2:2:1 orbits prevail in the collisionless simulation whereas additional asymmetrical families contribute to the B/PS if a dissipative component is present and can form new stars. We found that 2:3:1 and 2:5:1 orbits trap a significant fraction of the mass. A flat ringed discy stellar component also appears simultaneously with the thickening of the young population. It is due to the star formation in a nuclear gaseous disc located in the central kpc, inside the ILR, and accumulated there by the torques exerted by the large-scale bar. Remarkably, it remains flat throughout the simulation although it develops a nuclear bar, leading to a double-barred galaxy. We predict that two populations of B/PS bulges could exist and even coexist in the same galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:The interstellar medium (ISM) is subject, on one hand, to heating and cooling processes that tend to segregate it into distinct phases due to thermal instability (TI), and on the other, to turbulence-driving mechanisms that tend to produce strong nonlinear fluctuations in all the thermodynamic variables. In this regime, large-scale turbulent compressions in the stable warm neutral medium (WNM) dominate the clump-formation process rather than the linear developent of TI. Cold clumps formed by this mechanism are often bounded by sharp density and temperature discontinuities, which however are not contact discontinuities as in the classical 2-phase model, but rather "phase transition fronts", across which there is net mass and momentum flux from the WNM into the clumps. The clumps grow mainly by accretion through their boundaries, are in both thermal and ram pressure balance with their surroundings, and are internally turbulent as well, thus also having significant density fluctuations inside. The temperature and density of the cold and warm gas around the phase transition fronts fluctuate with time and location due to fluctuations in the turbulent pressure. Moreover, shock-compressed diffuse unstable gas can remain in the unstable regime for up to a few Myr before it undergoes a phase transition to the cold phase. These processes populate the classically forbidden density and temperature ranges. Since gas at all temperatures appears to be present in bi- or tri-stable turbulence, we conclude that the word "phase" applies only locally, surrounding phase transition sites in the gas. Globally, the word "phase" must relax its meaning to simply denote a certain temperature or density range.
astro-ph.GA:Active galactic nuclei (AGN) in low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) have received little attention in previous studies. In this paper, we present detailed spectral analysis of 194 LSBGs from the Impey et al. (1996) APM LSBG sample which have been observed spectroscopically by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 (SDSS DR5). Our elaborate spectral analysis enables us to carry out, for the first time, reliable spectral classification of nuclear activities in LSBGs based on the standard emission line diagnostic diagrams in a rigorous way. Star-forming galaxies are common, as found in about 52% LSBGs. We find, contrary to some of the previous claims, that the fraction of galaxies containing an AGN is significantly lower than that found in nearby normal galaxies of high surface brightness. This is qualitatively in line with the finding of Impey et al. (2001). This result holds true even within each morphological type from Sa to Sc. LSBGs having larger central stellar velocity dispersions, or larger physical sizes, tend to have a higher chance to harbor an AGN. For three AGNs with broad emission lines, the black hole masses estimated from the emission lines are broadly consistent with the well known M-$\sigma_\ast$ relation established for normal galaxies and AGNs.
astro-ph.GA:We take advantage of the very simple morphology of RCW 120 -- a perfect bubble -- to understand the mechanisms triggering star formation around an HII region and to establish what kind of stars are formed there. We present 870 microns observations of RCW 120, obtained with the APEX-LABOCA camera. These show the distribution of cold dust, and thus of neutral material. We use Spitzer-MIPS observations at 24 and 70 microns to detect the young stellar objects (YSOs) present in this region and to estimate their evolutionary stages.   A layer of dense neutral material surrounds the HII region, having been swept up during the region's expansion. This layer has a mass greater than 2000 solar masses and is fragmented, with massive fragments elongated along the ionization front (IF). We measured the 24 microns flux of 138 sources. Of these, 39 are Class I or flat-spectrum YSOs observed in the direction of the collected layer. We show that several triggering mechanisms are acting simultaneously in the swept-up shell, where they form a second generation of stars. No massive YSOs are detected. However, a massive, compact 870 microns core lies adjacent to the IF. A 70 microns source with no 24 microns counterpart is detected at the same position. This source is a likely candidate for a Class 0 YSO. Also at 24 microns, we detect a chain of about ten regularly spaced Class I or flat spectrum sources, parallel to the IF, in the direction of the most massive fragment. We suggest that the formation of these YSOs is the result of Jeans gravitational instabilities in the collected layer. Finally, the 870 microns emission, the 24 microns emission, and the Halpha emission show the existence of an extended and partially ionized photodissociation region around RCW 120.
astro-ph.GA:We examine the UV and X-ray properties of 256 radio-quiet SDSS quasars (QSOs) observed in X-rays with Chandra and/or XMM-Newton in order to study the relationship between QSOs with broad CIV absorption lines (BALs; width >2000 km/s) and those with CIV mini-BALs (here defined to have widths of 1000--2000 km/s). Our sample includes 42 BAL and 48 mini-BAL QSOs. The relative X-ray brightness and hard spectral slopes of the mini-BAL population are, on average, intermediate between those of BAL and non-BAL QSOs, as might be expected if narrower and broader absorption line outflows are physically related. However, a significant population of mini-BALs has outflow velocities higher than would be expected for BAL QSOs of the same relative X-ray brightness. Consistenly strong X-ray absorption is apparently not required to accelerate at least some mini-BALs to high outflow velocities. Assuming the mini-BAL features are correctly attributed to intrinsic CIV absorption, we suggest that their observed properties may be explained if mini-BALs are "seeds" which can be accelerated to form BALs when sufficient X-ray shielding is present.   We also examine several QSOs with broad CIV absorption that have been recently reported to be unusually X-ray bright. Such cases are frequently mini-BAL QSOs, which as a population are generally brighter in X-rays than BAL QSOs. Pointed XMM-Newton observations also suggest that these sources (or unresolved neighbors) may have been previously observed in a high flux state.
astro-ph.GA:The slopes of interstellar reddening lines in the 2MASS J-H versus H-Ks diagrams for 26 areas in the inner Galaxy (from Vulpecula to Centaurus) are determined. For this aim we use the red-clump giants located inside and behind spiral arms, or behind dense dust clouds of the Local arm. In most of the investigated directions the ratio E(J-H)/E(H-K_s) is found to be between 1.9 and 2.0, taking the stars with the visual extinction less than 12 mag. The stars with larger extinction deviate down from the reddening lines corresponding to less reddened stars. Probably, this is related to the curvature of reddening lines due to the band-width effect. However, some of the deviating stars may be heavily reddened oxygen- and carbon-rich AGB stars (giants of the latest M subclasses or N-type carbon stars), and pre-main-sequence objects (YSOs).
astro-ph.GA:The band-width effect on interstellar reddening lines in the J-H vs. H-K_s diagram of the 2MASS survey is investigated using synthetic color indices and color excesses based on the Kurucz model atmospheres. At large interstellar reddenings (E(H-K_s) larger than 1.0) reddening lines deviate considerably from a straight line. The lines can be approximated by an equation: E(J-H) = r E(H-K_s) + s E(H-K_s)^2, where the slope coefficient, r, and the curvature coefficient, s, depend slightly on the intrinsic energy distribution of the source. The curvature of the reddening lines is confirmed by the J-H vs. H-K_s diagrams plotted by Straizys and Laugalys (2008) from 2MASS observations.
astro-ph.GA:Recent observations of the white dwarf (WD) populations in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397 suggest that WDs receive a kick of a few km/s shortly before they are born. Using our Monte Carlo cluster evolution code, which includes accurate treatments of all relevant physical processes operating in globular clusters, we study the effects of the kicks on their host cluster and on the WD population itself. We find that in clusters whose velocity dispersion is comparable to the kick speed, WD kicks are a significant energy source for the cluster, prolonging the initial cluster core contraction phase significantly so that at late times the cluster core to half-mass radius ratio is a factor of up to ~ 10 larger than in the no-kick case. WD kicks thus represent a possible resolution of the large discrepancy between observed and theoretically predicted values of this key structural parameter. Our modeling also reproduces the observed trend for younger WDs to be more extended in their radial distribution in the cluster than older WDs.
astro-ph.GA:The unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN) predicts silicate emission features at 10 and 18 microns in type 1 AGN, and such features have now been observed in objects ranging from distant QSOs to nearby LINERs. More surprising, however, is the detection of silicate emission in a few type 2 AGN. By combining Gemini and Spitzer mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of NGC 2110, the closest known Seyfert 2 galaxy with silicate emission features, we can constrain the location of the silicate emitting region to within 32 pc of the nucleus. This is the strongest constraint yet on the size of the silicate emitting region in a Seyfert galaxy of any type. While this result is consistent with a narrow line region origin for the emission, comparison with clumpy torus models demonstrates that emission from an edge-on torus can also explain the silicate emission features and 2-20 micron spectral energy distribution of this object. In many of the best-fitting models the torus has only a small number of clouds along the line of sight, and does not extend far above the equatorial plane. Extended silicate-emitting regions may well be present in AGN, but this work establishes that emission from the torus itself is also a viable option for the origin of silicate emission features in active galaxies of both type 1 and type 2.
astro-ph.GA:Based on the kernel estimator and wavelet technique, we have identified 22 moving group candidates in the solar neighborhood from a sample which includes around 14,000 dwarfs and 6000 giants. Six of them were previously known as the Hercules stream, the Sirus-UMa stream, the Hyades stream, the Caster group, the Pleiades stream, and the IC 2391; five of them have also been reported by other authors. 11 moving group candidates, not previously reported in the literature, showprominent structures in dwarf or giant samples.Acatalog of moving group candidates in the solar neighborhood is presented in this work.
astro-ph.GA:The role played by protostellar feedback in clustered star formation is still a matter of debate. In particular, protostellar outflows have been proposed as a source of turbulence in cluster-forming clumps, which may provide support against global collapse for several free-fall times.   Here, we seek to test the above hypothesis in the case of the well-documented NGC 2264-C protocluster, byquantifying the amount of turbulence and support injected in the surrounding medium by protostellar outflows.   Using the HERA heterodyne array on the IRAM 30m telescope, we carried out an extensive mapping of NGC 2264-C in the three molecular line transitions 12CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1), and C18O(2-1). We found widespread high-velocity 12CO emission, testifying to the presence of eleven outflow lobes, closely linked to the compact millimeter continuum sources previously detected in the protocluster.   We carried out a detailed analysis of the dynamical parameters of these outflows, including a quantitative evaluation of the overall momentum flux injected in the cluster-forming clump. These dynamical parameters were compared to the gravitational and turbulent properties of the clump.   We show that the population of protostellar outflows identified in NGC 2264-C are likely to contribute a significant fraction of the observed turbulence but cannot efficiently support the protocluster against global collapse. Gravity appears to largely dominate the dynamics of the NGC 2264-C clump at the present time. It is however possible that an increase in the star formation rate during the further evolution of the protocluster will trigger sufficient outflows to finally halt the contraction of the cloud.
astro-ph.GA:OH(1720 MHz) masers are excellent signposts of interaction between supernova remnants(SNRs) and molecular clouds. Using the GBT and VLA we have surveyed 75 SNRs and six candidates for maser emission. Four new interacting SNRs are detected with OH masers: G5.4-1.2, G5.7-0.0, G8.7-0.1 and G9.7-0.0. The newly detected interacting SNRs G5.7-0.0 and G8.7-0.1 have TeV gamma-ray counterparts which may indicate a local cosmic ray enhancement. It has been noted that maser-emitting SNRs are preferentially distributed in the Molecular Ring and Nuclear Disk. We use the present and existing surveys to demonstrate that masers are strongly confined to within 50 degrees Galactic longitude at a rate of 15 percent of the total SNR population. All new detections are within 10 degrees Galactic longitude emphasizing this trend. Additionally, a substantial number of SNR masers have peak fluxes at or below the detection threshold of existing surveys. This calls into question whether maser surveys of Galactic SNRs can be considered complete and how many maser-emitting remnants remain to be detected in the Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:Photon-dominated regions (PDRs) are expected to show a layered structure in molecular abundances and emerging line emission, which is sensitive to the physical structure of the region as well as the UV radiation illuminating it. We aim to study this layering in the Orion Bar, a prototypical nearby PDR with a favorable edge-on geometry. We present new maps of 2 by 2 arcminute fields at 14-23 arcsecond resolution toward the Orion Bar in the SO 8_8-9_9, H2CO 5_(1,5)-4_(1,4), 13CO 3-2, C2H 4_(9/2)-3_(7/2) and 4_(7/2)-3_(5/2), C18O 2-1 and HCN 3-2 transitions. The data reveal a clear chemical stratification pattern. The C2H emission peaks close to the ionization front, followed by H2CO and SO, while C18O, HCN and 13CO peak deeper into the cloud. A simple PDR model reproduces the observed stratification, although the SO emission is predicted to peak much deeper into the cloud than observed while H2CO is predicted to peak closer to the ionization front than observed. In addition, the predicted SO abundance is higher than observed while the H2CO abundance is lower than observed. The discrepancies between the models and observations indicate that more sophisticated models, including production of H2CO through grain surface chemistry, are needed to quantitatively match the observations of this region.
astro-ph.GA:We measure the Tully-Fisher relations of 14 lenticular galaxies (S0s) and 14 spirals. We use two measures of rotational velocity. One is derived directly from observed spatially-resolved stellar kinematics and the other from the circular velocities of mass models that include a dark halo and whose parameters are constrained by detailed kinematic modelling. Contrary to the naive expectations of theories of S0 formation, we find no significant difference between the Tully-Fisher relations of the two samples when plotted as functions of both brightness and stellar mass.
astro-ph.GA:We analyze the conditions for detection of CO(1-0) emission in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the recently completed second NANTEN CO survey. In particular, we investigate correlations between CO integrated intensity and HI integrated intensity, peak brightness temperature, and line width at a resolution of 2.6' (~40 pc). We find that significant HI column density and peak brightness temperature are necessary but not sufficient conditions for CO detection, with many regions of strong HI emission not associated with molecular clouds. The large scatter in CO intensities for a given HI intensity persists even when averaging on scales of >200 pc, indicating that the scatter is not solely due to local conversion of HI into H_2 near GMCs. We focus on two possibilities to account for this scatter: either there exist spatial variations in the I(CO) to N(H_2) conversion factor, or a significant fraction of the atomic gas is not involved in molecular cloud formation. A weak tendency for CO emission to be suppressed for large HI linewidths supports the second hypothesis, insofar as large linewidths may be indicative of warm HI, and calls into question the likelihood of forming molecular clouds from colliding HI flows. We also find that the ratio of molecular to atomic gas shows no significant correlation (or anti-correlation) with the stellar surface density, though a correlation with midplane hydrostatic pressure P_h is found when the data are binned in P_h. The latter correlation largely reflects the increasing likelihood of CO detection at high HI column density.
astro-ph.GA:Recently, controversy has erupted over whether gas-rich spiral-spiral mergers are capable of forming {\it m$^{*}$} ellipticals. Measurements of $\sigma$$_{\circ}$ from the 2.29$\micron$ CO band-head for local LIRG/ULIRGs, suggest they are not. IR-bright mergers are often cited as the best candidates for forming massive ellipticals, so the recent observations have raised doubts about both the Toomre Merger Hypothesis and the fundamental assumptions of $\Lambda$-CDM galaxy formation models. However, kinematics obtained with the Calcium II Triplet at 8500 {\AA} suggest mergers are forming {\it m} $\ge$ {\it m$^{*}$} ellipticals. In this work, we show that kinematics derived from the CO stellar absorption band-head leads to a significant underestimation of the masses of LIRGs/ULIRGs. This is primarily due to the presence of a young population affecting CO band-head measurements.
astro-ph.GA:We present results of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies. Our simulations start from cosmological initial conditions at high redshift. They include metal-dependent cooling, star formation, feedback from type II and type Ia supernovae and UV background radiation, with physical recipes identical to those applied in a previous study of Milky Way type galaxies. We find that a combination of feedback and the cosmic UV background results in the formation of galaxies with properties similar to the Local Group dwarf spheroidals, and that their effect is strongly moderated by the depth of the gravitational potential. Taking this into account, our models naturally reproduce the observed luminosities and metallicities. The final objects have halo masses between 2.3x10^8 and 1.1x10^9 solar masses, mean velocity dispersions between 6.5 and 9.7 kms-1, stellar masses ranging from 5x10^5 to 1.2x10^7 solar masses, median metallicities between [Fe/H] = -1.8 and -1.1, and half-light radii of the order of 200 to 300 pc, all comparable with Local Group dwarf spheroidals. Our simulations also indicate that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies observed today lie near a halo mass threshold around 10^9 solar masses, in agreement with stellar kinematic data, where supernova feedback not only suffices to completely expel the interstellar medium and leave the residual gas-free, but where the combination of feedback, UV radiation and self-shielding establishes a dichotomy of age distributions similar to that observed in the Milky Way and M31 satellites.
astro-ph.GA:The SEGUE survey obtained 240,000 moderate resolution (R = 1800) spectra from 3900 - 9000 Angstroms of fainter Milky Way stars (14.0 < g < 20.3) of a wide variety of spectral types, both main sequence and evolved objects, with the goal of studying the kinematics and populations of our Galaxy and its halo. The spectra are clustered in 212 regions spaced over three-quarters of the sky. Radial velocity accuracies for stars are 4 km/s at g < 18, degrading to 15 km/s at g = 20. For stars with S/N > 10 per resolution element, stellar atmospheric parameters are estimated, including metallicity, surface gravity, and effective temperature. SEGUE obtained 3500 square degrees of additional ugriz imaging (primarily at low Galactic latitudes) providing precise multi-color photometry (g,r,i = 2%), (u,z = 3%) and astrometry (0.1 arcsec) for spectroscopic target selection. The stellar spectra, imaging data, and derived parameter catalogs for this survey are publicly available as part of SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7).
astro-ph.GA:We present results from X-ray analysis of a Galactic middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR) G156.2+5.7 which is bright and largely extended in X-ray wavelengths, showing a clear circular shape (radius about 50'). Using the Suzaku satellite, we observed this SNR in three pointings; partially covering the northwestern rim, the eastern rim, and the central portion of this SNR. In the northwestern rim and the central portion, we confirm that the X-ray spectra consist of soft and hard-tail emission, while in the eastern rim we find no significant hard-tail emission. The soft emission is well fitted by non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) model. In the central portion, a two-component (the interstellar medium and the metal-rich ejecta) NEI model fits the soft emission better than a one-component NEI model from a statistical point of view. The relative abundances in the ejecta component suggest that G156.2+5.7 is a remnant from a core-collapse SN explosion whose progenitor mass is less than 15 M_solar. The origin of the hard-tail emission is highly likely non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons. In the northwestern rim, the relativistic electrons seem to be accelerated by a forward shock with a slow velocity of about 500 km/sec.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the mean velocity dispersion and the velocity dispersion profile of stellar systems in MOND, using the N-body code N-MODY, which is a particle-mesh based code with a numerical MOND potential solver developed by Ciotti, Londrillo and Nipoti (2006). We have calculated mean velocity dispersions for stellar systems following Plummer density distributions with masses in the range of $10^4 M_\odot$ to $10^9 M_\odot$ and which are either isolated or immersed in an external field. Our integrations reproduce previous analytic estimates for stellar velocities in systems in the deep MOND regime ($a_i, a_e \ll a_0$), where the motion of stars is either dominated by internal accelerations ($a_i \gg a_e$) or constant external accelerations ($a_e \gg a_i$). In addition, we derive for the first time analytic formulae for the line-of-sight velocity dispersion in the intermediate regime ($a_i \sim a_e \sim a_0$). This allows for a much improved comparison of MOND with observed velocity dispersions of stellar systems. We finally derive the velocity dispersion of the globular cluster Pal 14 as one of the outer Milky Way halo globular clusters that have recently been proposed as a differentiator between Newtonian and MONDian dynamics.
astro-ph.GA:Historical optical data are combined with more recent optical, extreme ultraviolet, and X-ray data to update the spin ephemeris of the cataclysmic variable EX Hya.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) We perform dissipationless N-body simulations to elucidate the dynamical response of thin disks to bombardment by cold dark matter (CDM) substructure. Our method combines (1) cosmological simulations of the formation of Milky Way (MW)-sized CDM halos to derive the properties of substructure and (2) controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts onto an initially-thin, fully-formed MW type disk galaxy. The present study is the first to account for the evolution of satellite populations over cosmic time in such an investigation of disk structure. We find that accretions of massive subhalos onto the central regions of host halos, where the galactic disks reside, since z~1 should be common. One host halo accretion history is used to initialize the controlled simulations of satellite-disk encounters. We show that these accretion events severely perturb the thin galactic disk and produce a wealth of distinctive dynamical signatures on its structure and kinematics. These include (1) considerable thickening and heating at all radii, with the disk thickness and velocity ellipsoid nearly doubling at the solar radius; (2) prominent flaring associated with an increase in disk thickness greater than a factor of 4 in the disk outskirts; (3) surface density excesses at large radii, beyond ~5 disk scale lengths, resembling those of observed antitruncated disks; (4) lopsidedness at levels similar to those measured in observational samples of disk galaxies; and (5) substantial tilting. The interaction with the most massive subhalo drives the disk response while subsequent bombardment is much less efficient at disturbing the disk. We conclude that substructure-disk encounters of the kind expected in the LCDM paradigm play a significant role in setting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution.
astro-ph.GA:We present a study of active stellar forming regions in the environs of the HII region Sh2-205. The analysis is based on data obtained from point source catalogues and images extracted from 2MASS, MSX, and IRAS surveys. Complementary data are taken from CO survey. The identification of primary candidates to stellar formation activity is made following colour criteria and the correlation with molecular gas emission.   A number of stellar formation tracer candidates are projected on two substructures of the HII region: SH148.83-0.67 and SH149.25-0.00. However, the lack of molecular gas related to these structures casts doubts on the nature of the sources. Additional infrared sources may be associated with the HI shell centered at (l,b) = (149\degr 0\arcmin, -1\degr 30\arcmin).   The most striking active area was found in connection to the HII region LBN 148.11-0.45, where stellar formation candidates are projected onto molecular gas. The analytical model to the "collect and collapse" process shows that stellar formation activity could have been triggered by the expansion of this HII region.
astro-ph.GA:We report on a timing analysis performed on a 62-ks long XMM-Newton observation of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 during the latest X-ray outburst that started on September 21, 2008. By connecting the time of arrivals of the pulses observed during the XMM observation, we derived the best-fit orbital solution and a best-fit value of the spin period for the 2008 outburst. Comparing this new set of orbital parameters and, in particular, the value of the time of ascending-node passage with the orbital parameters derived for the previous four X-ray outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658 observed by the PCA on board RXTE, we find an updated value of the orbital period derivative, which turns out to be $\dot P_{\rm orb} = (3.89 \pm 0.15) \times 10^{-12}$ s/s. This new value of the orbital period derivative agrees with the previously reported value, demonstrating that the orbital period derivative in this source has remained stable over the past ten years. Although this timespan is not sufficient yet for confirming the secular evolution of the system, we again propose an explanation of this behavior in terms of a highly non-conservative mass transfer in this system, where the accreted mass (as derived from the X-ray luminosity during outbursts) accounts for a mere 1% of the mass lost by the companion.
astro-ph.GA:We present a study of the intrinsic UV absorption and emission lines in an historically low-state spectrum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548, which we obtained in 2004 February at high spatial and spectral resolution with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We isolate a component of emission with a width of 680 km/s (FWHM) that arises from an "intermediate line region" (ILR), similar to the one we discovered in NGC 4151, at a distance of ~1 pc from the central continuum source. From a detailed analysis of the five intrinsic absorption components in NGC 5548 and their behavior over a span of 8 years, we present evidence that most of the UV absorbers only partially cover the ILR and do not cover an extended region of UV continuum emission, most likely from hot stars in the circumnuclear region. We also find that four of the UV absorbers are at much greater distances (>70 pc) than the ILR, and none have sufficient N V or C IV column densities to be the ILR in absorption. At least a portion of the UV absorption component 3, at a radial velocity of -530 km/s, is likely responsible for most of the X-ray absorption, at a distance < 7 pc from the central source. The fact that we see the ILR in absorption in NGC 4151 and not in NGC 5548 suggests that the ILR is located at a relatively large polar angle (~45 degrees) with respect to the narrow-line region outflow axis.
astro-ph.GA:We study the velocity distribution of Milky Way disk stars in a kiloparsec-sized region around the Sun, based on ~ 2 million M-type stars from DR7 of SDSS, which have newly re-calibrated absolute proper motions from combining SDSS positions with the USNO-B catalogue. We estimate photometric distances to all stars, accurate to ~ 20 %, and combine them with the proper motions to derive tangential velocities for this kinematically unbiased sample of stars. Based on a statistical de-projection method we then derive the vertical profiles (to heights of Z = 800 pc above the disk plane) for the first and second moments of the three dimensional stellar velocity distribution. We find that <W> = -7 +/- 1 km/s and <U> = -9 +/- 1 km/s, independent of height above the mid-plane, reflecting the Sun's motion with respect to the local standard of rest. In contrast, <V> changes distinctly from -20 +/- 2 km/s in the mid-plane to <V> = -32 km/s at Z = 800 pc, reflecting an asymmetric drift of the stellar mean velocity that increases with height. All three components of the M-star velocity dispersion show a strong linear rise away from the mid-plane, most notably \sigma_{ZZ}, which grows from 18 km/s (Z = 0) to 40 km/s (at Z = 800 pc). We determine the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid, and find a significant vertex deviation of 20 to 25 degrees, which decreases only slightly to heights of Z = 800 pc. Away from the mid-plane, our sample exhibits a remarkably large tilt of the velocity ellipsoid towards the Galactic plane, which reaches 20 deg. at Z = 800 pc and which is not easily explained. Finally, we determine the ratio \sigma^2_{\phi\phi}/\sigma^2_{RR} near the mid-plane, which in the epicyclic approximation implies an almost perfectly flat rotation curve at the Solar radius.
astro-ph.GA:This work aims at investigating the molecular gas component in the vicinity of two young stellar object (YSO) candidates identified at the border of the HII region G034.8-0.7 that is evolving within a molecular cloud shocked by the SNR W44. The purpose is to explore signatures of star forming activity in this complex region. We performed a near and mid infrared study towards the border of the HII region G034.8-0.7 and observed a 90" X 90" region near 18h 56m 48s, +01d 18' 45" (J2000) using the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) in the 12CO J=3--2, 13CO J=3--2, HCO+ J=4--3 and CS J=7--6 lines with an angular resolution of 22". Based on the infrared study we propose that the source 2MASS 18564827+0118471 (IR1 in this work) is a YSO candidate. We discovered a bipolar 12CO outflow in the direction of the line of sight and a HCO+ clump towards IR1, confirming that it is a YSO. From the detection of the CS J=7--6 line we infer the presence of high density (>10^7 cm^-3) and warm (>60 K) gas towards IR1, probably belonging to the protostellar envelope where the YSO is forming. We investigated the possible genetic connection of IR1 with the SNR and the HII region. By comparing the dynamical time of the outflows and the age of the SNR W44, we conclude that the possibility of the SNR has triggered the formation of IR1 is unlikely. On the other hand, we suggest that the expansion of the HII region G034.8-0.7 is responsible for the formation of IR1 through the "collect and collapse" process.
astro-ph.GA:We report on Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA) and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations toward the Einstein source 1E 1740.7-2942, a LMXB commonly known as the "Great Annihilator." The Great Annihilator is known to be near a small, bright molecular cloud on the sky in a region largely devoid of emission in 12-CO surveys of the Galactic Center. The region is of interest because it is interior to the dust lanes which may be the shock zones where atomic gas from HI nuclear disk is converted into molecular gas. We find that the region is populated with a number of dense (n ~ 10^5 cm^-3) regions of excited gas with small filling factors, and estimate that up to 1-3 x 10^5 solar masses of gas can be seen in our maps. The detection suggests that a significant amount of mass is transported from the shock zones to the GC star-forming regions in the form of small, dense bundles.
astro-ph.GA:We use N-body/gasdynamical LambdaCDM cosmological simulations to examine the effect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of its dark halo. Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the evolution of the dark matter component and a second one where a baryonic component is added. These simulations include radiative cooling but neglect star formation and feedback, leading most baryons to collect at the halo center in a disk which is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral. This unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect that galaxies may have in transforming their dark halos. We find that the shape of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: halos are transformed from triaxial into essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly constant flattening (c/a ~ 0.85). Halos always contract as a result of galaxy assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the "adiabatic contraction" hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile LambdaCDM halos with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar circle and should alleviate the long-standing difficulty of matching simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy disks and the luminosity function. The halo contraction is also less pronounced than found in earlier simulations, a disagreement that suggests that halo contraction is not solely a function of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much baryonic mass has been deposited at the center of a halo matters, but also the mode of its deposition. It might prove impossible to predict the halo response without a detailed understanding of a galaxy's assembly history. (Abriged)
astro-ph.GA:We have mapped NGC 3718, a nearby bright galaxy in a loose group, and its companion NGC 3729 in the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen. NGC 3718 is a strikingly unusual galaxy with a strong straight dust lane across the center, peculiar diffuse spiral arms, and an extended disk of neutral hydrogen. Earlier work showed the gas disk to be strongly twisted, warping through edge-on where we see the straight dust lane; stars formed in this gas appear to make up the 'spiral arms'. Our improved maps show a twisted but bisymmetric disk of gas extending to 7arcmin or 35kpc, where the orbital period is roughly 1Gyr. It is surrounded by fragmentary spiral features, and a streamer of gas extending to a cloud lying 12arcmin or 60kpc to the north. We use INSPECTOR, a task in GIPSY, to fit a tilted-ring model interactively to slices through the HI data cube. The apparent major axis swings through 100 degrees from the innermost gas orbits at 30arcsec radius to the outer edge. When viewed in the reference frame of the galaxy's stellar disk, the innermost gas orbits are nearly polar, while the outer rings of gas are tilted at 30-40 degrees. The line of nodes, where the gas orbits pass through the plane of the stellar disk, twists by roughly 90 degrees about the pole. We do not see gas orbiting in the plane of the stellar disk. If we assume that the galaxy's dark halo shares the same midplane, then the observed twist can be explained by differential precession in a dynamical model in which the dark halo is fairly round. The run of tilt with radius is close to what is required for the warped gas disk to precess rigidly in the galaxy's gravitational field without changing its shape. This fact probably accounts for the longevity of the twisted structure.
astro-ph.GA:This White Paper to the National Academy of Sciences Astro2010 Decadal Review Committee highlights cross-disciplinary science opportunities over the next decade with cold brown dwarfs, sources defined here as having photospheric temperatures less than ~1000 K.
astro-ph.GA:A random, hydrogen-free, assembly of microscopic sp2 carbon chips, forming a macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic solid, is proposed as a model carrier for the UV interstellar extinction band . The validity of this model is based on the calculation of the Bruggeman average dielectric function of a mixture of the known parallel and perpendicular dielectric functions of graphite. The pi absorption feature of Rayleigh-sized spheres of this mixture falls near 4.6 mu-1 (2175 Angstroms), but its width is 1.5 mu-1, somewhat larger than the astronomically observed average, 1 mu-1. This is confirmed by measurements of the reflectance of an industrial material, polycrystalline graphite. A better fit to the IS feature position and width is obtained with a hypothetical material, having the same dielectric functions as natural graphite, except for less extended wings of the pi resonance. Physically, this could result from changes in the electronic band structure due to previous thermal histories. On this model, the Frolich feature central wavelength depends only on the pi resonance frequency, while its width depends only on the damping constant of the same resonance. This explains the range of observed feature widths at constant feature wavelength.
astro-ph.GA:The ionization fraction plays a key role in the chemistry and dynamics of molecular clouds. We study the H13CO+, DCO+ and HOC+ line emission towards the Horsehead, from the shielded core to the UV irradiated cloud edge, i.e., the Photodissociation Region (PDR), as a template to investigate the ionization fraction gradient in molecular clouds. We analyze a PdBI map of the H13CO+ J=1-0 line, complemented with IRAM-30m H13CO+ and DCO+ higher-J line maps and new HOC+ and CO+ observations. We compare self-consistently the observed spatial distribution and line intensities with detailed depth-dependent predictions of a PDR model coupled with a nonlocal radiative transfer calculation. The chemical network includes deuterated species, 13C fractionation reactions and HCO+/HOC+ isomerization reactions. The role of neutral and charged PAHs in the cloud chemistry and ionization balance is investigated. The detection of HOC+ reactive ion towards the Horsehead PDR proves the high ionization fraction of the outer UV irradiated regions, where we derive a low [HCO+]/[HOC+]~75-200 abundance ratio. In the absence of PAHs, we reproduce the observations with gas-phase metal abundances, [Fe+Mg+...], lower than 4x10(-9) (with respect to H) and a cosmic-rays ionization rate of zeta=(5+/-3)x10(-17) s(-1). The inclusion of PAHs modifies the ionization fraction gradient and increases the required metal abundance. The ionization fraction in the Horsehead edge follows a steep gradient, with a scale length of ~0.05 pc (or ~25''), from [e-]~10(-4) (or n_e ~ 1-5 cm(-3)) in the PDR to a few times ~10(-9) in the core. PAH^- anions play a role in the charge balance of the cold and neutral gas if substantial amounts of free PAHs are present ([PAH] >10(-8)).
astro-ph.GA:We aim at studying the effect of a cosmologically motivated gas infall law for the formation of a massive elliptical galaxy in order to understand its impact on the formation of the spheroids. We replace the empirical infall law of the model by Pipino & Matteucci with a cosmologically derived infall law for the formation of an elliptical galaxy. We constrast our predictions with observations. We also compare the obtained results with those of Pipino & Matteucci. We computed models with and without galactic winds: we found that models without wind predict a too large current SNIa rate. In particular, the cosmological model produces a current SNIa which is about ten times higher than the observed values. Moreover models without wind predict a large current SNII rate, too large even if compared with the recent GALEX data. The predicted SNII rate for the model with wind, on the other hand, is too low if compared with the star formation histories given by GALEX. Last but not least, the mean value for the [Mg/Fe] ratio in the dominant stellar population of the simulated galaxy, as predicted by the cosmological model, is too low if compared to observations. This is, a very important result indicating that the cosmological infall law is in contrast with the chemical evolution. A cosmologically derived infall law for an elliptical galaxy cannot reproduce all the chemical constraints given by the observations. The problem resides in the fact that the cosmologically derived infall law implies a slow gas accretion with consequent star formation rate active for a long period. In this situation low [Mg/Fe] ratios are produced for the dominant stellar population in a typical elliptical, at variance with observations.
astro-ph.GA:High resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a powerful diagnostic tool for probing chemical and physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) at various phases. We present detections of K transition absorption lines from the low ionization ions of OI, OII, NeI, NeII, and NeIII, and the high ionization ones of OVI, OVII, OVIII, NeIX, and MgXI, as well as details of neutral absorption edges from Mg, Ne, and O in an unprecedented high quality spectrum of the low mass X-ray binary Cyg X-2. These absorption features trace the intervening interstellar medium which is indicated by the unshifted line centroids with respect to the rest frame wavelengths of the corresponding atomic transitions. We have measured the column densities of each ion. We complement these measurements with the radio HI and optical Halpha observations toward the same sight line and estimate the mean abundances of Ne, O, and Mg in the cool phase to Ne/H=0.84^{+0.13}_{-0.10}\times10^{-4}, O/H=3.83^{+0.48}_{-0.43}\times10^{-4}, and Mg/H=0.35^{+0.09}_{-0.11}\times10^{-4}, and O and Mg in the hot phase to O/H=5.81^{+1.30}_{-1.34}\times10^{-4} and Mg/H=0.33^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\times10^{-4}, respectively. These results indicate a mild depletion of oxygen into dust grains in the cool phase and little or no depletion of magnesium. We also find that absorption from highly ionized ions in the hot Galactic disk gas can account for most of the absorption observed toward the extragalactic sight lines like Mrk 421. The bulk of the observed OVI likely originates from the conductive interfaces between the cool and hot gases, from which a significant amount of NV and CIV emission is predicted.
astro-ph.GA:We present results from a multi-year monitoring campaign of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 120, using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) for nearly five years of observations. Additionally, we present coincident optical monitoring using data from several ground-based observatories. Both the X-ray and optical emission are highly variable and appear to be strongly correlated, with the X-ray emission leading the optical by 28 days. The X-ray power density spectrum is best fit by a broken power law, with a low-frequency slope of -1.2, breaking to a high-frequency slope of -2.1, and a break frequency of log nu_b=-5.75 Hz, or 6.5 days. This value agrees well with the value expected based on 3C 120's mass and accretion rate. We find no evidence for a second break in the power spectrum. Combined with a moderately soft X-ray spectrum (Gamma=1.8) and a moderately high accretion rate (mdot / mdot_Edd ~ 0.3), this indicates that 3C 120 fits in wellwith the high/soft variability state found in most other AGNs. Previous studies have shown that the spectrum has a strong Fe K-alpha line, which may be relativistically broadened. The presence of this line, combined with a power spectrum similar to that seen in Seyfert galaxies, suggests that the majority of the X-ray emission in this object arises in or near the disk, and not in the jet.
astro-ph.GA:We have determined interstellar extinction law toward the Galactic center (GC) at the wavelength from 1.2 to 8.0 micron, using point sources detected in the IRSF/SIRIUS near-infrared survey and those in the 2MASS and Spitzer/IRAC/GLIMPSE II catalogs. The central region |l| < 3deg and |b| < 1deg has been surveyed in the J, H and Ks bands with the IRSF telescope and the SIRIUS camera whose filters are similar to the Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) near-infrared photometric system. Combined with the GLIMPSE II point source catalog, we made Ks versus (Ks - lambda) color-magnitude diagrams where lambda = 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron. The Ks magnitudes of bulge red clump stars and the (Ks - lambda) colors of red giant branches are used as a tracer of the reddening vector in the color-magnitude diagrams. From these magnitudes and colors, we have obtained the ratios of total to selective extinction A(Ks)/E(Ks-lambda) for the four IRAC bands. Combined with A(lambda)/A(Ks) for the J and H bands derived by Nishiyama et al., we obtain A(J):A(H):A(Ks):A([3.6]):A([4.5]):A([5.8]):A([8.0])=3.02:1.73:1:0.50:0.39:0.36:0.43 for the line of sight toward the GC. This confirms the flattening of the extinction curve at lambda > 3 micron from a simple extrapolation of the power-law extinction at shorter wavelengths, in accordance with recent studies. The extinction law in the 2MASS JHKs bands has also been calculated, and a good agreement with that in the MKO system is found. In nearby molecular clouds and diffuse interstellar medium, the lack of reliable measurements of the total to selective extinction ratios hampers unambiguous determination of the extinction law; however, observational results toward these lines of sight cannot be reconciled with a single extinction law.
astro-ph.GA:This paper presents new observations of the AGNs M87 and Hydra A at 90 GHz made with the MUSTANG bolometer array on the Green Bank Telescope at 8.5" resolution. A spectral analysis is performed combining this new data and archival VLA data on these objects at longer wavelengths. This analysis can detect variations in spectral index and curvature expected from energy losses in the radiating particles. M87 shows only weak evidence for steepening of the spectrum along the jet suggesting either re-acceleration of the relativistic particles in the jet or insufficient losses to affect the spectrum at 90 GHz. The jets in Hydra A show strong steepening as they move from the nucleus suggesting unbalanced losses of the higher energy relativistic particles. The difference between these two sources may be accounted for by the different lengths over which the jets are observable, 2 kpc for M87 and 45 kpc for Hydra A.
astro-ph.GA:The giant molecular cloud G216-2.5, also known as Maddalena's cloud or the Maddalena-Thaddeus cloud, is distinguished by an unusual combination of high gas mass (1-6 x 10^5) solar masses, low kinetic temperatures (10 K), and the lack of bright far infrared emission. Although star formation has been detected in neighboring satellite clouds, little evidence for star formation has been found in the main body of this cloud. Using a combination of mid-infrared observations with the IRAC and MIPS instruments onboard the Spitzer space telescope, and near-IR images taken with the Flamingos camera on the KPNO 2.1-meter, we identify a population of 41 young stars with disks and 33 protostars in the center of the cloud. Most of the young stellar objects are coincident with a filamentary structure of dense gas detected in CS (2-1). These observations show that the main body of G216 is actively forming stars, although at a low stellar density comparable to that found in the Taurus cloud.
astro-ph.GA:M17 is one of the youngest and most massive nearby star-formation regions in the Galaxy. It features a bright H II region erupting as a blister from the side of a giant molecular cloud (GMC). Combining photometry from the Spitzer GLIMPSE survey with complementary infrared (IR) surveys, we identify candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) throughout a 1.5 deg x 1 deg field that includes the M17 complex. The long sightline through the Galaxy behind M17 creates significant contamination in our YSO sample from unassociated sources with similar IR colors. Removing contaminants, we produce a highly-reliable catalog of 96 candidate YSOs with a high probability of association with the M17 complex. We fit model spectral energy distributions to these sources and constrain their physical properties. Extrapolating the mass function of 62 intermediate-mass YSOs (M >3 Msun), we estimate that >1000 stars are in the process of forming in the extended outer regions of M17.   From IR survey images from IRAS and GLIMPSE, we find that M17 lies on the rim of a large shell structure ~0.5 deg in diameter (~20 pc at 2.1 kpc). We present new maps of CO and 13CO (J=2-1) emission, which show that the shell is a coherent, kinematic structure associated with M17 at v = 19 km/s. The shell is an extended bubble outlining the photodissociation region of a faint, diffuse H II region several Myr old. We provide evidence that massive star formation has been triggered by the expansion of the bubble. The formation of the massive cluster ionizing the M17 H II region itself may have been similarly triggered. We conclude that the star formation history in the extended environment of M17 has been punctuated by successive waves of massive star formation propagating through a GMC complex.
astro-ph.GA:We present a systematic spectral analysis with Suzaku of six AGNs detected in the Swift/BAT hard X-ray (15--200 keV) survey, Swift J0138.6-4001, J0255.2-0011, J0350.1-5019, J0505.7-2348, J0601.9-8636, and J1628.1-5145. This is considered to be a representative sample of new AGNs without X-ray spectral information before the BAT survey. We find that the 0.5--200 keV spectra of these sources can be uniformly fit with a base model consisting of heavily absorbed (log $N_{\rm{H}} > 23.5 \rm{cm}^{-2}$) transmitted components, scattered lights, a reflection component, and an iron-K emission line. There are two distinct groups, three "new type" AGNs (including the two sources reported by \citealt{Ueda2007}) with an extremely small scattered fraction ($f_{\rm{scat}} < 0.5%$) and strong reflection component ($R = \Omega / 2 \pi \gtrsim 0.8$ where $\Omega$ is the solid angle of the reflector), and three "classical type" ones with $f_{\rm{scat}} > 0.5%$ and $R \lesssim 0.8$. The spectral parameters suggest that the new type has an optically thick torus for Thomson scattering ($N_{\rm{H}} \sim 10^{25} \rm{cm}^{-2}$) with a small opening angle $\theta \sim 20^{\circ}$ viewed in a rather face-on geometry, while the classical type has a thin torus ($N_{\rm{H}} \sim 10^{23-24} \ \rm{cm}^{-2}$) with $\theta \gtrsim 30^{\circ}$. We infer that a significant number of new type AGNs with an edge-on view is missing in the current all-sky hard X-ray surveys.
astro-ph.GA:We present the discovery of two brown dwarfs in the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Deep Extragalactic Survey (DXS) Data Release 2. Both objects were selected photometrically from six square degrees in DXS for their blue J-K colour and the lack of optical counterparts in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82. Additional optical photometry provided by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHT-LS) corroborated the possible substellarity of these candidates. Subsequent methane imaging of UDXS J221611.51+003308.1 and UDXS J221903.10+002418.2, has confirmed them as T7$\pm$1 and T6$\pm$1 dwarfs at photometric distances of 81 (52-118 pc) and 60 (44-87 pc; 2 sigma confidence level). A similar search in the second data release of the Ultra Deep Survey over a smaller area (0.77 square degree) and shallower depth didn't return any late-T dwarf candidate. The numbers of late-T dwarfs in our study are broadly in line with a declining mass function when considering the current area and depth of the DXS and UDS. These brown dwarfs are the first discovered in the VIMOS 4 field and among the few T dwarfs found in pencil-beam surveys. They are valuable to investigate the scale height of T dwarfs.
astro-ph.GA:We are studying the column density distribution of all nearby giant molecular clouds. As part of this project we generated several all sky extinction maps. They are calculated using the median near infrared colour excess technique applied to data from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). Our large scale approach allows us to fit spline functions to extinction free regions in order to accurately determine the colour excess values. Two types of maps are presented: i) Maps with a constant noise and variable spatial resolution; ii) Maps with a constant spatial resolution and variable noise. Our standard Av map uses the nearest 49 stars to the centre of each pixel for the determination of the extinction. The one sigma variance is constant at 0.28mag Av in the entire map. The distance to the 49th nearest star varies from below 1arcmin near the Galactic Plane to about 10arcmin at the poles, but is below 5arcmin for all giant molecular clouds (|b|< 30degr). A comparison with existing large scale maps shows that our extinction values are systematically larger by 20% compared to Dobashi et al. and 40% smaller compared to Schlegel et al.. This is most likely caused by the applied star counting technique in Dobashi et al. and systematic uncertainties in the dust temperature and emissivity in Schlegel et al.. Our superior resolution allows us to detect more small scale high extinction cores compared to the other two maps.
astro-ph.GA:Collimated fast winds (CFWs) have been proposed to operate during the post-AGB evolutionary phase (and even earlier during the late AGB phase), responsible for the shaping of pre-planetary nebulae (PPNs) and young planetary nebulae (PNs). This paper is a follow-up to our previous study of CFW models for the well-studied PPN CRL 618. Previously, we compared our CFW models with optical observations of CRL 618 in atomic and ionic lines and found that a CFW with a small opening angle can readily reproduce the highly collimated shape of the northwestern (W1) lobe of CRL 618 and the bow-like structure seen at its tip. In this paper, we compare our CFW models with recent observations of CRL 618 in CO J=2-1, J=6-5, and H2 1-0 S(1). In our models, limb-brightened shell structures are seen in CO and H2 at low velocity arising from the shocked AGB wind in the shell, and can be identified as the low-velocity (LV) components in the observations. However, the shell structure in CO J=2-1 is significantly less extended than that seen in the observations. None of our models can properly reproduce the observed high-velocity (HV) molecular emission near the source along the body of the lobe. In order to reproduce the HV molecular emission in CRL 618, the CFW is required to have a different structure. One possible CFW structure is the cylindrical jet, with the fast wind material confined to a small cross section and collimated to the same direction along the outflow axis.
astro-ph.GA:Planetary nebulae (and in general any photoionized region) can be classified as ionization-bounded or density-bounded. It is important to determine in which case is the planetary nebula studied to be able to estimate from nebular observations, for example, the total rate of ionizing photons produced by the central star. In this paper we present a simple observational criterion that uses radio continuum images and that allows to establish a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the planetary nebula to be considered as ionization-bounded. We apply the criterion to two planetary nebulae: NGC 7027 is most possibly ionization-bounded, while Hb~4 is density-bounded, at least in some directions.
astro-ph.GA:A combination of observation, theory, modeling, and laboratory plasma experiments provides a multifaceted approach to develop a much greater understanding of how magnetic fields arise in galactic settings and how these magnetic fields mediate important processes that affect the dynamics, distribution, and composition of galactic plasmas. An important emphasis below is the opportunity to connect laboratory experiments to astrophysics. This approach is especially compelling for the galactic neighborhood, where the distribution and character of magnetic fields can be observed with greater detail than what is possible elsewhere in the universe. The ability to produce laboratory plasmas with unparalleled accessibility permits an even greater level of detail to be assessed and exposed. Theory and modeling provide fundamental ways to understand important processes, and they act as the bridge to connect experimental validation to astronomical observations. In many cases the studies that utilize this approach can make use of existing laboratory facilities, resulting in a cost that is quite small compared to the cost of measurements in dedicated space missions.
astro-ph.GA:We consider the scenario of a magnetic field orthogonal to a front separating two media of different temperatures and densities, such as cold and warm interstellar gas, in a 2-D plane-parallel geometry. A linear stability analysis is performed to assess the behavior of both evaporation and condensation fronts when subject to incompressible, corrugational perturbations with wavelengths larger than the thickness of the front. We discuss the behavior of fronts in both super-Alfvenic and sub-Alfvenic flows. Since the propagation speed of fronts is slow in the ISM, it is the sub-Alfvenic regime that is relevant, and magnetic fields are a significant influence on front dynamics. In this case we find that evaporation fronts, which are unstable in the hydrodynamic regime, are stabilized. Condensation fronts are unstable, but for parameters typical of the neutral ISM the growth rates are so slow that steady state fronts are effectively stable. However, the instability may become important if condensation proceeds at a sufficiently fast rate. This paper is the first in a series exploring the linear and nonlinear effects of magnetic field strength and orientation on the corrugational instability, with the ultimate goal of addressing outstanding questions about small-scale ISM structure.
astro-ph.GA:Tests for the intrinsic shape of the luminosity distribution in elliptical galaxies are discussed, with an emphasis on the uncertainties. Recent determinations of the ellipticity frequency function imply a paucity of nearly spherical galaxies, and may be inconsistent with the oblate hypothesis. Statistical tests based on the correlation of surface brightness, isophotal twisting, and minor axis rotation with ellipticity have so far not provided strong evidence in favor of the nearly oblate or nearly prolate hypothesis, but are at least qualitatively consistent with triaxiality. The possibility that the observed deviations of elliptical galaxy isophotes form ellipses are due to projection effects is evaluated. Dynamical instabilities may explain the absence of elliptical galaxies flatter than about E6, and my also play a role in the lack of nearly-spherical galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:In general, HII regions do not show clear signs of self-enrichment in products from massive stars (M > 8 M_sun). In order to explore why, I modeled the contamination with Wolf-Rayet star ejecta of metal-poor (Z=0.001) HII regions, ionised either by a 10^6 M_sun cluster of coeval stars (cluster 1), or a cluster resulting from continuous star formation at a rate of 1 M_sun yr^-1 (cluster 2). The clusters have Z=0.001 and a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) from 0.1 to 120 M_sun. Independent one dimensional constant density simulations of the emission-line spectra of unenriched HII regions were computed at the discrete ages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Myr, with the photoionisation code CLOUDY, using as input, radiative and mechanical stellar feedbacks predicted by the evolutionary synthesis code STARBURST99. Each HII region was placed at the outer radius of the adiabatically expanding superbubble of Mac Low and McCray (1988). For models with thermal and ionisation balance time-scales of less than 1 Myr, and with oxygen emission-line ratios in agreement with observations, the interior of the superbubble and the HII region were uniformly and instantaneously polluted with stellar ejecta predicted by STARBURST99. I obtained a maximum oxygen abundance enhancement of 0.025 dex, with cluster 1, at 4 Myr. It would be unobservable.
astro-ph.GA:Context. SuperclusterA in the extragalactic HII region NGC2363 is remarkable for the hypersonic gas seen as faint extended broad emission lines with a full width zero intensity of 7000km/s. Aims. We explore the possibility that the observed broad profiles are the result of the interaction of a high velocity cluster wind with dense photoionized clumps. Methods. The geometry considered is that of near static photoionized condensations at the surface of which turbulent mixing layers arise as a result of the interaction with the hot wind. The approximative treatment of turbulence is carried out using the mixing length approach of Canto & Raga. The code mappings Ic is used to derive the mean quantities describing the flow and to compute the line emissivities within the turbulent layers. The velocity projection in three dimensions of the line sources is carried out analytically. Results. A fast entraining wind of up to ~4300km/s appears to be required to reproduce the faint wings of the broad H-alpha and [O III] profiles. A slower wind of 3500km/s, however, can still reproduce the bulk of the broad component and does provide a better fit than an ad hoc Gaussian profile. Conclusions. Radial acceleration in 3D (away from supercluster A) of the emission gas provides a reasonable first order fit to the broad line component. No broad component is predicted for the [N II] and [S II] lines, as observed. The wind velocity required is uncomfortably high and alternative processes that would provide comparable constant acceleration of the emission gas up to 4000km/s might have to be considered.
astro-ph.GA:In a recent outburst which lasted for 260 days, the black hole candidate GRO J1655-40 exhibited a behaviour similar to its last outburst observed almost eight years ago. We analyze a total of 150 observational spells in 122 days of data spreaded over the entire outburst phase of Feb. 2005 to Oct. 2005. From our study, a comprehensive understanding of the detailed behaviour of this black hole candidate has emerged. Based on the degree of importance of the black body and the power-law components we divide the entire episode in four spectral states, namely, hard, soft, very soft and intermediate. Quasi-Periodic oscillations (QPOs) were found in two out of these four states, namely, in the hard and the intermediate states. In the hard state, at the rising phase of the outburst, QPO frequency ranged from 0.034 - 17.78Hz and the spectra was fitted by a disk black body, power-law and iron emission line at 6.2 - 6.5 keV. In the intermediate state, QPOs vary from 13.17Hz to 19.04Hz and the QPO frequency modulation in this state was not significant. The spectra in this state are well fitted by the disk black body and the power-law components. In the hard state of the declining phase of the outburst, we found QPOs of decreasing frequency from 13.14 Hz to 0.034 Hz. The spectra of this state were fitted by a disk black body and power-law components, but in the initial few days a cooler Comptonized component was required for a better fit. In the soft and very soft states, the spectral states are mostly dominated by the strong disk black body component.
astro-ph.GA:Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are located at the photometric and dynamical centers of the majority of galaxies. They are among the densest star clusters in the Universe. The NSC in the Milky Way is the only object of this class that can be resolved into individual stars. We measured the proper motions of more than 6000 stars within ~1.0 pc of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The full data set is provided in this work. We largely exclude the known early-type stars with their peculiar dynamical properties from the dynamical analysis. The cluster is found to rotate parallel to Galactic rotation, while the velocity dispersion appears isotropic (or anisotropy may be masked by the cluster rotation). The Keplerian fall-off of the velocity dispersion due to the point mass of Sgr A* is clearly detectable only at R <~ 0.3 pc. Nonparametric isotropic and anisotropic Jeans models are applied to the data. They imply a best-fit black hole mass of 3.6 (+0.2/-0.4) x 10^6 solar masses. Although this value is slightly lower than the current canonical value of 4.0x10^6 solar masses, this is the first time that a proper motion analysis provides a mass for Sagittarius A* that is consistent with the mass inferred from orbits of individual stars. The point mass of Sagittarius A* is not sufficient to explain the velocity data. In addition to the black hole, the models require the presence of an extended mass of 0.5-1.5x10^6 solar masses in the central parsec. This is the first time that the extended mass of the nuclear star cluster is unambiguously detected. The influence of the extended mass on the gravitational potential becomes notable at distances >~0.4 pc from Sgr A*. Constraints on the distribution of this extended mass are weak. The extended mass can be explained well by the mass of the stars that make up the cluster.
astro-ph.GA:Recent advances in radio astrometry with the VLBA have resulted in near micro-arcsecond accurate trigonometric parallax and proper motion measurements for masers in star forming regions. We are now poised to directly measure the full 3-dimensional locations and motions of every massive star forming region in the Milky Way and for the first time to map its spiral structure. Such measurements would also yield the full kinematics of the Milky Way and determine its fundamental parameters (Ro and To) with 1% accuracy. Coupled with other observations this would yield the distribution of mass among the various components (including dark matter) of the Milky Way.
astro-ph.GA:Classical novae are phenomena caused by explosive hydrogen burning on an accreting white dwarf. So far, only one classical nova has been identified in X-rays before the actual optical outburst occurred (V2487 Oph). The recently discovered nova, V2491 Cyg, is one of the fastest (He/N) novae observed so far. Using archival ROSAT, XMM-Newton and Swift data, we show that V2491 Cyg was a persistent X-ray source during its quiescent time before the optical outburst. We present the X-ray spectral characteristics and derive X-ray fluxes. The pre-outburst X-ray emission is variable, and at least in one observation it shows a very soft X-ray source.
astro-ph.GA:It is generally believed that O stars, confined near the galactic midplane, are somehow able to photoionize a significant fraction of what is termed the "diffuse ionized gas" (DIG) of spiral galaxies, which can extend up to 1-2 kpc above the galactic midplane. The heating of the DIG remains poorly understood, however, as simple photoionization models do not reproduce the observed line ratio correlations well or the DIG temperature. We present turbulent mixing layer models in which warm photoionized condensations are immersed in a hot supersonic wind. Turbulent dissipation and mixing generate an intermediate region where the gas is accelerated, heated and mixed. The emission spectrum of such layers are compared with observations of Rand (ApJ 462, 712) of the DIG in the edge-on spiral NGC2363. We generate two sequence of models that fit the line ratio correlations between [SII]/H-alpha, [OI]/H-alpha, [NII]/[SII] and [OIII]/H-beta reasonably well. In one sequence of models the hot wind velocity increases while in the other the ionization parameter and layer opacity increases. Despite the success of the mixing layer models, the overall efficiency in reprocessing the stellar UV is much too low, much less than 1%, which compels us to reject the TML model in its present form.
astro-ph.GA:We present new optical imaging and spectroscopy and HI spectral line imaging of the dwarf galaxy ADBS 113845+2008 (hereafter ADBS 1138). This metal-poor (Z~30% Z_Sun), "post-starburst" system has one of the most compact stellar distributions known in any galaxy to date (B-band exponential scale length =0.57 kpc). In stark contrast to the compact stellar component, the neutral gas is extremely extended; HI is detected to a radial distance of ~25 kpc at the 10^19 cm^-2 level (>44 B-band scale lengths). Comparing to measurements of similar "giant disk" dwarf galaxies in the literature, ADBS 1138 has the largest known HI-to-optical size ratio. The stellar component is located near the center of a broken ring of HI that is ~15 kpc in diameter; column densities peak in this structure at the ~3.5x10^20 cm^-2 level. At the center of this ring, in a region of comparatively low HI column density, we find ongoing star formation traced by H alpha emission. We sample the rotation curve to the point of turn over; this constrains the size of the dark matter halo of the galaxy, which outweighs the luminous component (stars + gas) by at least a factor of 15. To explain these enigmatic properties, we examine "inside-out" and "outside-in" evolutionary scenarios. Calculations of star formation energetics indicate that "feedback" from concentrated star formation is not capable of producing the ring structure; we posit that this is a system where the large HI disk is evolving in quiescent isolation. In a global sense, this system is exceedingly inefficient at converting neutral gas into stars.
astro-ph.GA:The Ophiuchus clouds, in particular L~1688, are an excellent region to study the embedded phases of star formation, due to the relatively large number of protostars. However, the standard method of finding and characterizing embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) through just their infrared spectral slope does not yield a reliable sample. This may affect the age determinations, often derived from the statistics on the total number of embedded YSOs and pre-main sequence stars within a cloud.Our aim is to characterize the structure of protostellar envelopes on an individual basis and to correctly identify the embedded YSO population of L1688. Spectral maps of the HCO+ J=4--3 and C18O J=3--2 lines using the HARP-B array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and SCUBA 850 micron dust maps are obtained of all sources in the L1688 region with infrared spectral slopes consistent with, or close to, that of embedded YSOs. Selected 350 micron maps obtained with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory are presented as well. The properties, extent and variation of dense gas, column density and dust on scalesup to 1' are probed at 15" resolution. Using the spatial variation of the gas and dust, together with the intensity of the HCO+ J=4--3 line, we are able to accurately identify the truly embedded YSOs and determine their properties. RESULTS The protostellar envelopes range from 0.05 to 0.5 Msun in mass. The concentration of HCO+ emission (~0.5 to 0.9) is generally higher than that of the dust concentration. Combined with absolute intensities, HCO+ proves to be a better tracer of protostellar envelopes than dust, which can contain disk and cloud contributions. Our total sample of 45 sources, including all previously classified Class I sources, several flat-spectrum sources and some known disks, was re-classified using the ....
astro-ph.GA:We aim to characterise the properties of the stellar clusters in the Milky Way. Utilising an expectation-maximisation method we determined that the cluster FSR0358, originally discovered by J.D.Kirkpatrick, is the most likely real cluster amongst the cluster candidates from Froebrich et al.. Here we present new deep high resolution near infrared imaging of this object obtained with UKIRT. The analysis of the data reveals that FSR0358 (Kirkpatrick1) is a 5+-2Gyr old open cluster in the outer Milky Way. Its age, metallicity of Z=0.008 and distance from the Galactic Centre of 11.2kpc are typical for the known old open galactic clusters. So far six of the FSR cluster candidates have been identified as having an age above 5Gyr. This shows the significance of this catalogue in enhancing our knowledge of the oldest open clusters in the Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:We present a new large-scale survey of J=3-2 12CO emission covering 4.8 square degrees around the Rosette Nebula. Approximately 2000 compact clumps are identified, with a spatially-invariant power law mass distribution index of -1.8. Most of the inner clumps show velocity gradients of 1-3 km/s/pc, directed away from the exciting nebula. The gradients decrease with distance from the central O stars, and are consistent with a photoionised gas acceleration model, assuming clump lifetimes of a few 10^5 yrs. However, in one clear case, the observed near-constant velocity gradient is difficult to explain with simple models. Most blue-shifted but very few of the red-shifted clumps are associated with dark absorbing optical globules, confirming that the dominant molecular gas motion is expansion away from the central nebula and O stars. Many clumps also lie in a molecular ring, having an expansion velocity of 30 km/s, radius 11pc, and dynamical lifetime of ~1Myr. The J=3-2/1-0 12CO line ratios of the clumps decrease with distance from the O stars, implying a gradient in their surface temperatures; the results are consistent with a simple model of clump surface heating due to the central stars.   Seven high-velocity molecular flows are found in the region, with a close correspondence between these flows and embedded young clusters. These outflows are sufficiently energetic to drive local gas turbulence within each cluster.   We find 14 clear examples of association between embedded young stars seen at 24um and CO clumps; these are thought to be photoevaporating molecular envelopes. The CO clumps without evidence of embedded stars tend to have lower velocity gradients, and it is suggested that the presence of the young star may extend the lifespan of the photoevaporating envelope.
astro-ph.GA:The Carina Nebula is one of the youngest, most active sites of massive star formation in our Galaxy. In this nebula, we have discovered a bright X-ray source that has persisted for ~30 years. The soft X-ray spectrum, consistent with kT ~128 eV blackbody radiation with mild extinction, and no counterpart in the near- and mid-infrared wavelengths indicate that it is a ~1e6-year-old neutron star housed in the Carina Nebula. Current star formation theory does not suggest that the progenitor of the neutron star and massive stars in the Carina Nebula, in particular Eta Carinae, are coeval. This result suggests that the Carina Nebula experienced at least two major episodes of massive star formation. The neutron star may be responsible for remnants of high energy activity seen in multiple wavelengths.
astro-ph.GA:We discuss the outstanding issues of the interstellar medium which will depend on the application of knowledge from plasma physics. We particularly advocate attention to recent developments in experimental plasma physics, and urge that the astronomical community consider support of these experiments in the next decade.
astro-ph.GA:The resolved stellar populations of local galaxies, from which it is possible to derive complete star formation and chemical enrichment histories, provide an important way to study galaxy formation and evolution that is complementary to lookback time studies. We propose to use photometry of resolved stars to measure the star formation histories in a statistical sample of galaxy disks and E/S0 galaxies near their effective radii. These measurements would yield strong evidence to support critical questions regarding the formation of galactic disks and spheroids. The main technological limitation is spatial resolution for photometry in heavily crowded fields, for which we need improvement by a factor of ~10 over what is possible today with filled aperture telescopes.
astro-ph.GA:Science opportunities and recommendations concerning optical/infrared polarimetry for the upcoming decade in the field of Galactic science. Community-based White Paper to Astro2010 in response to the call for such papers.
astro-ph.GA:We present multi-wavelength observations (from optical to sub-millimeter, including Spitzer and SCUBA) of H2XMMJ 003357.2-120038 (also GD158_19), an X-ray selected, luminous narrow-line (Type 2) quasar at z=1.957 selected from the HELLAS2XMM survey. Its broad-band properties can be reasonably well modeled assuming three components: a stellar component to account for the optical and near-IR emission, an AGN component (i.e., dust heated by an accreting active nucleus), dominant in the mid-IR, with an optical depth at 9.7 micron along the line of sight (close to the equatorial plane of the obscuring matter) of tau(9.7)=1 and a full covering angle of the reprocessing matter (torus) of 140 degrees, and a far-IR starburst component (i.e., dust heated by star formation) to reproduce the wide bump observed longward of 70 micron. The derived star-formation rate is about 1500 solar masses per year. The overall modeling indicates that GD158_19 is a high-redshift X-ray luminous, obscured quasar with coeval powerful AGN activity and intense star formation. It is probably caught before the process of expelling the obscuring gas has started, thus quenching the star formation.
astro-ph.GA:A wide range of recent observations have shown that AGN-driven cavities may provide the energy source that balances the cooling observed in the centres of cool-core galaxy clusters. One tool for better understanding the physics of these cavities is their observed morphological evolution, which is dependent on such poorly-understood properties as the turbulent density field and the impact of magnetic fields. Here we combine numerical simulations that include subgrid turbulence and software that produces synthetic X-ray observations to examine the evolution of X-ray cavities in the absence of magnetic fields. Our results reveal an anisotropic size evolution of that is dramatically different from simplified, analytical predictions. These differences highlight some of the key issues that must be accurately quantified when studying AGN-driven cavities, and help to explain why the inferred pV energy in these regions appears to be correlated with their distance from the cluster center. Interpreting X- ray observations will require detailed modeling of effects including mass-entrainment, distortion by drag forces, and pro jection. Current limitations do not allow a discrimination between purely hydrodynamic and magnetically-dominated models for X-ray cavities.
astro-ph.GA:We have conducted a series of investigations on the geometry of the reddening material in AGNs, which have important implications to the AGN unification and SMBH demography. According to our statistics of partially obscured quasars, we found that SMBHs in partially obscured type/phase (i.e., intermediate type) are at least as abundant as normal quasars in the local Universe; the reddening material in most objects are located in between the BLR and NLR. According to our comparison of narrow lines in type 1 and 2 AGNs, we found that for high-ionization or high-critical density narrow lines (e.g. OIII 5007, Balmer lines and FeII) a significant fraction of the emission arises from the inner dense part of the NLR; this inner NLR is located very close to the central engine and thus can be covered by the torus.
astro-ph.GA:A massive objects such as a globular cluster passing through the disk of a galaxy can trigger star formation. We test the hypothesis that the most massive globular cluster in the Galaxy, $\omega$ Centauri, which crossed the disk approximately $24\pm2$ Myr ago, may have triggered the formation of the open clusters Stephenson 2 and BDSB 122. The orbits of $\omega$ Centauri, Stephenson 2 and BDSB 122 are computed for the three-component model of Johnston, Hernquist & Bolte, which considers the disk, spheroidal and halo gravitational potentials. With the re-constructed orbit of $\omega$ Centauri, we show that the latest impact site is consistent, within important uncertainties, with the birth-site of the young massive open clusters BDSB 122 and Stephenson 2. Within uncertainties, this scenario is consistent with the time-scale of their backwards motion in the disk, shock wave propagation and delay for star formation. Together with open cluster formation associated to density waves in spiral arms, the present results are consistent with the idea that massive globular clusters as additional progenitors of open clusters, the massive ones in particular.
astro-ph.GA:We report on the identification of the highest redshift submm-selected source currently known: LESSJ033229.4-275619. This source was detected in the Large Apex BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA) Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) Submillimetre Survey (LESS), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mJy rms) of the full 30'x30' ECDFS with the LABOCA camera on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope. The submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart for which optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. We show that the bolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of ~1000 Msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in this galaxy. Thus it has characteristics similar to those of z~2 submm galaxies (SMGs), with a mix of starburst and obscured AGN signatures. This demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restricted to the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) QSOs at z~5, but was also occurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the Universe was less than 10% of its current age. Assuming that we are seeing the major phase of star formation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as a luminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the space density of z>4 SMGs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous red galaxy population at these early times. However, this leaves open the possibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but more extended star formation events. If the progenitors of all of the luminous red galaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z>4 then the required volume density of z>4 SMGs will exceed that predicted by current galaxy formation models by more than an order of magnitude.
astro-ph.GA:We present the spectral analysis of a large set of XMM-Newton observations of EXO 0748-676, a bright dipping LMXB. In particular, we focus on the dipping phenomenon as a result of changes in the properties of the ionised gas close to the source. Using the high-resolution spectra collected with the RGS, we explored two simple geometrical scenarios for which we derived physical quantities of the absorbing material like the density, size, and mass. We find that the continuum is absorbed by a neutral gas, and by both a collisionally (temperature T~70 eV) and photoionised (ionisation parameter log\xi~2.5) absorbers. Emission lines from OVII and OVIII are also detected. This is the first time that evidence of a collisionally ionised absorber has been found in a low-mass X-ray binary. The collisionally ionised absorber may be in the form of dense (n>10^14 cm^-3) filaments, located at a distance r>10^11 cm. During dips, the photoionised absorber significantly increases its column density (factor 2--4) while becoming less ionised. This strengthens the idea that the colder material of the accretion stream impinging the disc is passing on our line of sight during dips. We find that the distance from the neutron star to the impact region (~ 5x10^10 cm) is similar to the size of the neutron star's Roche lobe. The gas observed during the persistent state may have a flattened geometry. Finally, we explore the possibility of the existence of material forming an initial, hotter portion of a circumbinary disc.
astro-ph.GA:We examine the proposal that the HI "high-velocity" clouds (HVCs) surrounding the Milky Way and other disc galaxies form by condensation of the hot galactic corona via thermal instability. Under the assumption that the galactic corona is well represented by a non-rotating, stratified atmosphere, we find that for this formation mechanism to work the corona must have an almost perfectly flat entropy profile. In all other cases the growth of thermal perturbations is suppressed by a combination of buoyancy and thermal conduction. Even if the entropy profile were nearly flat, cold clouds with sizes smaller than 10 kpc could form in the corona of the Milky Way only at radii larger than 100 kpc, in contradiction with the determined distances of the largest HVC complexes. Clouds with sizes of a few kpc can form in the inner halo only in low-mass systems. We conclude that unless even slow rotation qualitatively changes the dynamics of a corona, thermal instability is unlikely to be a viable mechanism for formation of cold clouds around disc galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:We presented CAIXA, a Catalogue of AGN in the XMM-Newton Archive, in Bianchi et al. (2009). It consists of all the radio-quiet X-ray unobscured (N$_\mathrm{H}<2\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) observed by XMM-Newton in targeted observations, whose data are public as of March 2007. With its 156 sources, this is the largest catalogue of high signal-to-noise X-ray spectra of AGN. All the EPIC pn spectra of the sources in CAIXA were extracted homogeneously and a baseline model was applied in order to derive their basic X-ray properties. These data are complemented by multiwavelength data found in the literature: Black Hole masses, Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of Hbeta, radio and optical fluxes. A systematic search for correlations between the X-ray spectral properties and the multiwavelength data was performed for the sources in CAIXA. We discuss here some of the significant (>99.9 % confidence level) correlations.
astro-ph.GA:Context. IC 1396N is a bright-rimmed cloud associated with an intermediate-mass star-forming region, where a number of Herbig-Haro objects, H2 jet-like features, CO molecular outflows, and millimeter compact sources have been observed. Aims. To study in detail the complex structure of the IC 1396N core and the molecular outflows detected in the region and to reveal the presence of additional YSOs inside this globule. Methods. We carried out a deep survey of the IC 1396N region in the J, H, K' broadband filters and deep high-angular resolution observations in the H2 narrowband filter with NICS at the TNG telescope. The completeness limits in the 2MASS standard are Ks~17.5, H~18.5 and J~19.5. Results. A total of 736 sources have been detected in all three bands within the area where the JHK' images overlap. There are 128 sources detected only in HK', 67 detected only in K', and 79 detected only in H. We found only few objects exhibiting a Near-Infrared excess and no clear signs of clustering of sources towards the southern rim. In case of triggered star formation in the southern rim of the globule, this could be very recent, because it is not evidenced through Near-Infrared imaging alone. The H2 emission is complex and knotty and shows a large number of molecular hydrogen features spread over the region, testifying a recent star-formation activity throughout the whole globule. This emission is resolved into several chains or groups of knots that sometimes show a jet-like morphology. The shocked cloudlet model scenario previously proposed to explain the V-shaped morphology of the CO molecular outflow powered by the intermediate-mass YSO BIMA 2 seems to be confirmed by the presence of H2 emission at the position of the deflecting western clump. New possible flows have been discovered in the globule,
astro-ph.GA:We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations, made with the TIMMI2 camera on the ESO 3.6 m telescope, toward 14 young massive star-forming regions. All regions were imaged in the N band, and nine in the Q band, with an angular resolution of ~ 1 arcsec. Typically, the regions exhibit a single or two compact sources (with sizes in the range 0.008-0.18 pc) plus extended diffuse emission. The Spitzer-Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire images of these regions show much more extended emission than that seen by TIMMI2, and this is attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands. For the MIR sources associated with radio continuum radiation (Paper I) there is a close morphological correspondence between the two emissions, suggesting that the ionized gas (radio source) and hot dust (MIR source) coexist inside the H II region. We found five MIR compact sources which are not associated with radio continuum emission, and are thus prime candidates for hosting young massive protostars. In particular, objects IRAS 14593-5852 II (only detected at 17.7 microns) and 17008-4040 I are likely to be genuine O-type protostellar objects. We also present TIMMI2 N-band spectra of eight sources, all of which are dominated by a prominent silicate absorption feature (~ 9.7 microns). From these data we estimate column densities in the range (7-17)x10^22 cm^-2, in good agreement with those derived from the 1.2 mm data (Paper II). Seven sources show bright [Ne II] line emission, as expected from ionized gas regions. Only IRAS 123830-6128 shows detectable PAH emission at 8.6 and 11.3 microns.
astro-ph.GA:We consider the possibility of detecting intermediate-mass ($10^3-10^4 M_{\odot}$) black holes, whose existence at the centers of globular clusters is expected from optical and infrared observations, using precise pulse arrival timing for the millisecond pulsars in globular clusters known to date. For some of these pulsars closest to the cluster centers, we have calculated the expected delay times of pulses as they pass in the gravitational field of the central black hole. The detection of such a time delay by currently available instruments for the known pulsars is shown to be impossible at a black hole mass of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ and very problematic at a black hole mass of $10^4 M_{\odot}$. In addition, the signal delay will have a negligible effect on the pulsar periods and their first derivatives compared to the current accuracy of their measurements.
astro-ph.GA:In recent years, organic molecules of increasing complexity have been found toward the prolific Galactic center source Sagittarius B2. We wish to explore the degree of complexity that the interstellar chemistry can reach in star-forming regions. We carried out a complete line survey of the hot cores Sgr B2(N) and (M) with the IRAM 30 m telescope in the 3 mm range. We analyzed this spectral survey in the LTE approximation. We modeled the emission of all known molecules simultaneously, which allows us to search for less abundant, more complex molecules. We compared the derived column densities with the predictions of a coupled gas-phase and grain-surface chemical code. We report the first detection in space of ethyl formate (C2H5OCHO) and n-propyl cyanide (C3H7CN) toward Sgr B2(N). The abundances of ethyl formate and n-propyl cyanide relative to H2 are estimated to be 3.6e-9 and 1.0e-9, respectively. Our chemical modeling suggests that the sequential, piecewise construction of ethyl and n-propyl cyanide from their constituent functional groups on the grain surfaces is their most likely formation route. Ethyl formate is primarily formed on the grains by adding CH3 to functional-group radicals derived from methyl formate, although ethanol may also be a precursor. The detection in Sgr B2(N) of the next stage of complexity in two classes of complex molecule, esters and alkyl cyanides, suggests that greater complexity in other classes of molecule may be present in the interstellar medium. {Abridged}
astro-ph.GA:We present medium-resolution spectra of 16 radial velocity red-giant members of the low-luminosity Bootes I dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy, that have sufficient S/N for abundance determination, based on the strength of the Ca II K line. Assuming [Ca/Fe] ~ +0.3, the abundance range in the sample is Delta [Fe/H] ~ 1.7 dex, with one star having [Fe/H] = -3.4. The dispersion is sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.45 +/- 0.08 -- similar to those of the Galaxy's more luminous dSph systems and Omega Centauri. This suggests that the large mass (greater than approximately 10 million solar masses) normally assumed to foster self-enrichment and the production of chemical abundance spreads was provided by the non-baryonic material in Bootes I.
astro-ph.GA:We present VLT-SINFONI K-band IFU spectroscopy of the central galaxies in the cool core clusters A1664, A2204 and PKS 0745-191, to probe the Pa-alpha and ro-vibrational H2 line emission. In A1664 the two emission-line velocity systems seen in our previous H-alpha data appear in both Pa-alpha and H2 emission, with notable morphological differences. The recession velocity of the red component of Pa-alpha increases linearly with decreasing radius, particularly along an 8 kpc filament aligned with the major axis of the underlying galaxy and the cluster X-ray emission. These kinematics are modelled as gravitational free-fall as gas cools rapidly out of the hot phase. In A2204 the gas shows 3 or 4 filaments reaching 10 kpc, three of which lie towards `ghost bubbles' seen in X-ray imaging. For PKS 0745-191, we confirm the twin-arm morphology of previous narrow-band images; the Pa-alpha kinematics suggest rotational motion about an axis aligned with the kpc-scale radio jet; on nucleus, we find a broad Pa-alpha component (FWHM 1700 km/s) and a secondary H2 system redshifted by +500 km/s.   The H2 v=1-0 S(3)/Pa-alpha ratio is highest in isolated and extended regions where it matches the levels in the NGC 1275 filaments as modelled by Ferland et al. Regions with lower ratios highlight active star formation and are often kinematically quiescent (FWHM < 200 km/s). Our findings suggest that these clusters may be captured in different stages of the `cold feedback' cycle of Pizzolato & Soker, with A1664 in a brief phase of extreme cooling and star formation prior to an AGN heating event; PKS 0745-191 in outburst with the AGN accreting from a cool gas disk, and A2204 in a later phase where cool gas is dragged out of the galaxy by the buoyant rise of old radio bubbles (abridged).
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) Bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) are isolated molecular clouds located on the edges of evolved HII regions where star formation is thought may have been triggered. In this paper we investigate the current level of star formation within a sample of BRCs and evaluate to what extent star formation may have been induced. We present the results of a programme of position-switched CO observations towards 45 southern BRCs. The 12CO, 13CO and C18O (J=1-0) were simultaneously observed using the 22m Mopra telescope. We complement these observations with archival mid-IR submm and radio data. Analysis of the CO, mid-IR and radio data result in the clouds being divided into three distinct groups. We refer to these groups as spontaneous, triggered, and zapped clouds, respectively. Comparing the physical parameters of spontaneous and triggered samples we find striking differences in luminosity, surface temperature and column density with all three quantities significantly enhanced for the clouds considered to have been triggered. Furthermore, we find strong evidence for star formation within the triggered sample by way of methanol and H_2O masers, embedded mid-IR point sources and CO wings, however, we find evidence of ongoing star formation within only two of the spontaneous sample. We have used CO, mid-IR and radio data to identify 24 of the 45 southern BRCs that are undergoing a strong interaction with their HII region. We can therefore exclude ~50% from future studies. 14 of the 24 interacting BRCs are found to be associated with embedded mid-IR point sources and we find strong evidence of that these clouds are forming stars. The absence of mid-infrared sources towards the remaining ten clouds leads us to conclude that these represent an earlier evolutionary stage of star formation.
astro-ph.GA:To better understand the initial conditions of the high-mass star formation process, it is crucial to study at high-angular resolution the morphology, the kinematics, and eventually the interactions of the coldest condensations associated with intermediate-/high-mass star forming regions. The paper studies the cold condensations in the intermediate-/high-mass proto-cluster IRAS 05345+3157, focusing the attention on the interaction with the other objects in the cluster. We have performed millimeter high-angular resolution observations, both in the continuum and several molecular lines, with the PdBI and the SMA. In a recent paper, we have already published part of these data. The main finding of that work was the detection of two cold and dense gaseous condensations, called N and S (masses ~2 and ~9 M_sun), characterised by high values of the deuterium fractionation (~0.1 in both cores). In this paper, we present a full report of the observations, and a complete analysis of the data obtained. The millimeter maps reveal the presence of 3 cores inside the interferometers primary beam, called C1-a, C1-b and C2. None of them are associated with cores N and S. C1-b is very likely associated with a newly formed early-B ZAMS star embedded inside a hot-core, while C1-a is more likely associated with a class 0 intermediate-mass protostar. The nature of C2 is unclear. Both C1-a and C1-b are good candidates as driving sources of a powerful CO outflow, which strongly interacts with N and S, as demonstrated by the velocity gradient across both condensations. Our major conclusion is that the chemical properties of these pre-stellar cores are similar to those observed in low-mass isolated ones, while the kinematics is dominated by the turbulence triggered by the CO outflow and can influece their evolution.
astro-ph.GA:We explore what dominant physical mechanism sets the kinetic energy contained in neutral, atomic (HI) gas. We compare the HI line widths predicted from turbulence driven by supernova (SN) explosions and magneto-rotational instability (MRI) to direct observations in 11 disk galaxies. We use high-quality maps of the HI mass surface density and line width, obtained by the THINGS survey. We show that all sample galaxies exhibit a systematic radial decline in the HI line width, which appears to be a generic property of HI disks and also implies a radial decline in kinetic energy density of HI. At a galactocentric radius of r25 there is a characteristic value of the HI velocity dispersion of $10\pm2$ \kms. Inside this radius, galaxies show HI line widths above the thermal value expected from a warm HI component, implying that turbulence drivers must be responsible for maintaining this line width. Therefore, we compare maps of HI kinetic energy to maps of the star formation rate (SFR) and to predictions for energy generated by MRI. We find a positive correlation between kinetic energy of HI and SFR. For a given turbulence dissipation timescale we can estimate the energy input required to maintain the observed kinetic energy. The SN rate implied by the observed recent SFR is sufficient to maintain the observed velocity dispersion, if the SN feedback efficiency is at least \epsilon_SN\simeq0.1. Beyond r25, this efficiency would have to increase to unrealistic values, $\epsilon>1$, suggesting that mechanical energy from young stars does not supply most energy in outer disks. On the other hand, both thermal broadening and turbulence driven by MRI can produce the velocity dispersions and kinetic energies that we observe in this regime.
astro-ph.GA:Magnetic pressure has long been known to dominate over gas pressure in atomic and molecular regions of the interstellar medium. Here I review several recent observational studies of the relationships between the H^+, H^0 and H_2 regions in M42 (the Orion complex) and M17. A simple picture results. When stars form they push back surrounding material, mainly through the outward momentum of starlight acting on grains, and field lines are dragged with the gas due to flux freezing. The magnetic field is compressed and the magnetic pressure increases until it is able to resist further expansion and the system comes into approximate magnetostatic equilibrium. Magnetic field lines can be preferentially aligned perpendicular to the long axis of quiescent cloud before stars form. After star formation and pushback occurs ionized gas will be constrained to flow along field lines and escape from the system along directions perpendicular to the long axis. The magnetic field may play other roles in the physics of the H II region and associated PDR. Cosmic rays may be enhanced along with the field and provide additional heating of atomic and molecular material. Wave motions may be associated with the field and contribute a component of turbulence to observed line profiles.
astro-ph.GA:It has been argued that the energy content in time varying spacetimes can be obtained by using the approximate Lie symmetries of the geodesics equations in that spacetime. When applied to cylindrical gravitational waves, it gives a self-damping of the waves. According to this proposal the energy of the waves go to zero asymptotically as the radial distance to the two-thirds power. If true, this would mean that the estimates for the sensitivity of the detectors for the various sources would have to be revised
astro-ph.GA:We present intermediate resolution long-slit spectra and narrow-band Halpha, [NII] and [OIII] images of PM1-242, PM318 and PM1-333, three IRAS sources classified as possible planetary nebulae. The spectra show that the three objects are true planetary nebulae and allow us to study their physical properties; the images provide a detailed view of their morphology. PM1-242 is a medium-to-high-excitation (e.g., HeII4686/Hbeta ~0.4; [NII]6584/Halpha ~0.3) planetary nebula with an elliptical shape containing [NII] enhanced point-symmetric arcs. An electron temperature [Te([SIII])] of ~10250 K and an electron density [Ne([SII])] of ~2300 cm-3 are derived for PM1-242. Abundance calculations suggest a large helium abundance (He/H ~0.29) in PM1-242. PM1-318 is a high-excitation (HeII4686/Hbeta ~1) planetary nebula with a ring-like inner shell containing two enhanced opposite regions, surrounded by a fainter round attached shell brighter in the light of [OIII]. PM1-333 is an extended planetary nebula with a high-excitation (HeII4686/Hbeta up to ~0.9) patchy circular main body containing two low-excitation knotty arcs. A low Ne([SII]) of ~450 cm-3 and Te([OIII]) of ~15000 K are derived for this nebula. Abundance calculations suggest that PM1-333 is a type I planetary nebula. The lack of a sharp shell morphology, low electron density, and high-excitation strongly suggest that PM1-333 is an evolved planetary nebula. PM1-333 also shows two low-ionization polar structures whose morphology and emission properties are reminiscent of collimated outflows. We compare PM1-333 with other evolved planetary nebulae with collimated outflows and find that outflows among evolved planetary nebulae exhibit a large variety of properties, in accordance with these observed in younger planetary nebula.
astro-ph.GA:The main objective of this work is to investigate the role played by Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) and Upper Centaurus Lupus (UCL), both subcomponents of the Scorpio Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen), in the formation of the groups beta Pictoris, TW Hydrae and the eta Chamaeleontis cluster. The dynamical evolution of all the stellar groups involved and of the bubbles and shells blown by LCC and UCL are calculated and followed from the past to the present. This leads to a formation scenario in which (1) the groups beta Pictoris, TW Hydrae were formed in the wake of the shells created by LCC and UCL, (2) the young cluster eta Chamaeleontis was born as a consequence of the collision of the shells of LCC and UCL, and (3) the formation of Upper Scorpius (US), the other main subcomponent of the Sco-Cen association, may have been started by the same process that created eta Chamaeleontis.
astro-ph.GA:Most stars are born in rich young stellar clusters (YSCs) embedded in giant molecular clouds. The most massive stars live out their short lives there, profoundly influencing their natal environments by ionizing HII regions, inflating wind-blown bubbles, and soon exploding as supernovae. Thousands of lower-mass pre-main sequence stars accompany the massive stars, and the expanding HII regions paradoxically trigger new star formation as they destroy their natal clouds. While this schematic picture is established, our understanding of the complex astrophysical processes involved in clustered star formation have only just begun to be elucidated. The technologies are challenging, requiring both high spatial resolution and wide fields at wavelengths that penetrate obscuring molecular material and remove contaminating Galactic field stars. We outline several important projects for the coming decade: the IMFs and structures of YSCs; triggered star formation around YSC; the fate of OB winds; the stellar populations of Infrared Dark Clouds; the most massive star clusters in the Galaxy; tracing star formation throughout the Galactic Disk; the Galactic Center region and YSCs in the Magellanic Clouds. Programmatic recommendations include: developing a 30m-class adaptive optics infrared telescope; support for high-resolution and wide field X-ray telescopes; large-aperture sub-millimeter and far-infrared telescopes; multi-object infrared spectrographs; and both numerical and analytical theory.
astro-ph.GA:Our multi-epoch survey of ~20 sq. deg. of the Canis Major overdensity has detected only 10 RR Lyrae stars (RRLS). We show that this number is consistent with the number expected from the Galactic halo and thick disk populations alone, leaving no excess that can be attributed to the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy that some authors have proposed as the origin of the CMa overdensity. If this galaxy resembles the dSph satellites of the Milky Way and of M31 and has the putative Mv~-14.5, our survey should have detected several tens of RRLS. Even if Mv<-12, the expected excess is >10, which is not observed. Either the old stellar population of this galaxy has unique properties or, as others have argued before, the CMa overdensity is produced by the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way and not by a collision with a dSph satellite galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:We have constructed an analytical model of AGN feedback and studied its implications for elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters. The results show that momentum injection above a critical value will eject material from low mass elliptical galaxies, and leads to an X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm X}$, that is $\propto$ $\sigma^{8-10}$, depending on the AGN fuelling mechanism, where $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the hot gas. This result agrees well with both observations and semi-analytic models. In more massive ellipticals and clusters, AGN outflows quickly become buoyancy-dominated. This necessarily means that heating by a central cluster AGN redistributes the intracluster medium (ICM) such that the mass of hot gas, within the cooling radius, should be $ \propto L_{\rm X}(<r_{\rm cool})/[g(r_{\rm cool})\sigma]$, where $g(r_{\rm cool})$ is the gravitational acceleration at the cooling radius. This prediction is confirmed using observations of seven clusters. The same mechanism also defines a critical ICM cooling time of $\sim 0.5$ Gyr, which is in reasonable agreement with recent observations showing that star formation and AGN activity are triggered below a universal cooling time threshold.
astro-ph.GA:We study the feedback from an AGN on stellar formation within its host galaxy, mainly using one high resolution numerical simulation of the jet propagation within the interstellar medium of an early-type galaxy. In particular, we show that in a realistic simulation where the jet propagates into a two-phase ISM, star formation can initially be slightly enhanced and then, on timescales of few million years, rapidly quenched, as a consequence both of the high temperatures attained and of the reduction of cloud mass (mainly due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities). We then introduce a model of (prevalently) {\em negative} AGN feedback, where an exponentially declining star formation is quenched, on a very short time scale, at a time t_AGN, due to AGN feedback. Using the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) population synthesis model and our star formation history, we predict galaxy colours from this model and match them to a sample of nearby early-type galaxies showing signs of recent episodes of star formation (Kaviraj et al. 2007). We find that the quantity t_gal - t_AGN, where t_gal is the galaxy age, is an excellent indicator of the presence of feedback processes, and peaks significantly around t_gal - t_AGN \approx 0.85 Gyr for our sample, consistent with feedback from recent energy injection by AGNs in relatively bright (M_{B} \lsim -19) and massive nearby early-type galaxies. Galaxies that have experienced this recent feedback show an enhancement of 3 magnitudes in NUV(GALEX)-g, with respect to the unperturbed, no-feedback evolution. Hence they can be easily identified in large combined near UV-optical surveys.
astro-ph.GA:The structure of globular clusters and elliptical galaxies are described in an unified way through a new class of lowered models inspired on the nonextensive kinetic theory. These power law models are specified by a single parameter q which quantifies to what extent they depart from the class of lowered stellar distributions discussed by Michie and King. For q equal to unity, the Michie-King profiles are recovered. However, for q smaller than unity there is a gradual modification in the shape of the density profiles which depends on the degree of tidal damage imposed on the model, thereby also providing a good fit for globular clusters. It is also shown that a subclass of these models, those with a deeper potential and $q$ slightly less than unity, present a distribution resembling the de Vaucoulers $r^{1/4}$ profile which yields a good description of the structure of elliptical galaxies. This subset of models follows this trend, with a slight departure over nearly 10 orders of magnitudes.
astro-ph.GA:We obtained long-slit spectra of high signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy M32 with the GMOS spectrograph at the GEMINI North telescope. We analysed the integrated spectra by means of full spectral fitting in order to extract the mixture of stellar populations that best represents its composite nature. Three different galactic radii were analysed, from the nuclear region out to 2 arcmin from the centre. This allows us to compare, for the first time, the results of integrated light spectroscopy with those of resolved colour-magnitude diagrams from the literature. As our main result, we propose that an ancient and an intermediate-age population coexist in M32, and that the balance between these two populations change between the nucleus and outside 1 effective radius in the sense that the contribution from the intermediate population is larger at the nuclear region. We retrieve a smaller signal of a young population at all radii whose origin is unclear and may be a contamination from horizontal-branch stars, such as the ones identified by Brown et al. in the nuclear region. We compare our metallicity distribution function for a region 1 to 2 arcmin from the centre to the one obtained with photometric data by Grillmair et al. Both distributions are broad, but our spectroscopically derived distribution has a significant component with $[Z/Z_{\sun}] \leq -1$, which is not found by Grillmair et al.
astro-ph.GA:This is an introduction to the basic elements needed for the measurements and interpretation of data in the millimeter and sub-mm wavelength range. A more complete version will be published in the proceedings of the Saas Fee Winter School 2008.
astro-ph.GA:We present an analysis of results on absorption from Ca II, Ca I, K I, and the molecules CH+, CH, C2, and CN that probes gas interacting with the supernova remnant IC443. The eleven directions sample material across the visible nebula and beyond its eastern edge. Most of the neutral material, including the diatomic molecules, is associated with the ambient cloud detected via H I and CO emission. Analysis of excitation and chemistry yields gas densities that are typical of diffuse molecular gas. The low density gas probed by Ca II extends over a large range in velocities, from -120 to +80 km/s in the most extreme cases. This gas is distributed among several velocity components, unlike the situation for the shocked molecular clumps, whose emission occurs over much the same range but as very broad features. The extent of the high-velocity absorption suggests a shock velocity of 100 km/s for the expanding nebula.
astro-ph.GA:This paper reports dual-epoch, Very Long Baseline Array observations of H I absorption toward 3C 147. One of these epochs (2005) represents new observations while one (1998) represents the reprocessing of previous observations to obtain higher signal-to-noise results. Significant H I opacity and column density variations, both spatially and temporally, are observed with typical variations at the level of \Delta\tau ~ 0.20 and in some cases as large as \Delta\tau ~ 0.70, corresponding to column density fluctuations of order 5 x 10^{19} cm^{-2} for an assumed 50 K spin temperature. The typical angular scale is 15 mas; while the distance to the absorbing gas is highly uncertain, the equivalent linear scale is likely to be about 10 AU. Approximately 10% of the face of the source is covered by these opacity variations, probably implying a volume filling factor for the small-scale absorbing gas of no more than about 1%. Comparing our results with earlier results toward 3C 138 (Brogan et al.), we find numerous similarities, and we conclude that small-scale absorbing gas is a ubiquitous phenomenon, albeit with a low probability of intercept on any given line of sight. Further, we compare the volumes sampled by the line of sight through the Galaxy between our two epochs and conclude that, on the basis of the motion of the Sun alone, these two volumes are likely to be substantially different. In order to place more significant constraints on the various models for the origin of these small-scale structures, more frequent sampling is required in any future observations.
astro-ph.GA:We have conducted a systematic investigation of the origin and underlying physics of the line--line and line--continuum correlations of AGNs, particularly the Baldwin effect. Based on the homogeneous sample of Seyfert 1s and QSOs in the SDSS DR4, we find the origin of all the emission-line regularities is Eddington ratio (L/Ledd). The essential physics is that L/Ledd regulates the distributions of the properties (particularly column density) of the clouds bound in the line-emitting region.
astro-ph.GA:Using 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we studied in detail the fountain flow and its dependence with several factors, such as the Galactic rotation, the distance to the Galactic center, and the presence of a hot gaseous halo. We have considered the observed size-frequency distribution of young stellar clusters within the Galaxy in order to appropriately fuel the multiple fountains in our simulations. The present work confirms the localized nature of the fountain flows: the freshly ejected metals tend to fall back close to the same Galactocentric region where they are delivered. Therefore, the fountains do not change significantly the radial profile of the disk chemical abundance. The multiple fountains simulations also allowed to consistently calculate the feedback of the star formation on the halo gas. Finally, we have also considered the possibility of mass infall from the intergalactic medium and its interaction with the clouds that are formed by the fountains. Though our simulations are not suitable to reproduce the slow rotational pattern that is typically observed in the halos around the disk galaxies, they indicate that the presence of an external gas infall may help to slow down the rotation of the gas in the clouds and thus the amount of angular momentum that they transfer to the coronal gas, as previously suggested in the literature.
astro-ph.GA:The spiral structure of our Milky Way Galaxy is not yet known. HII regions and giant molecular clouds are the most prominent spiral tracers. We collected the spiral tracer data of our Milky Way from the literature, namely, HII regions and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). With weighting factors based on the excitation parameters of HII regions or the masses of GMCs, we fitted the distribution of these tracers with models of two, three, four spiral-arms or polynomial spiral arms. The distances of tracers, if not available from stellar or direct measurements, were estimated kinetically from the standard rotation curve of Brand & Blitz (1993) with $R_0$=8.5 kpc, and $\Theta_0$=220 km s$^{-1}$ or the newly fitted rotation curves with $R_0$=8.0 kpc and $\Theta_0$=220 km s$^{-1}$ or $R_0$=8.4 kpc and $\Theta_0$=254 km s$^{-1}$. We found that the two-arm logarithmic model cannot fit the data in many regions. The three- and the four-arm logarithmic models are able to connect most tracers. However, at least two observed tangential directions cannot be matched by the three- or four-arm model. We composed a polynomial spiral arm model, which can not only fit the tracer distribution but also match observed tangential directions. Using new rotation curves with $R_0$=8.0 kpc and $\Theta_0$=220 km s$^{-1}$ and $R_0$=8.4 kpc and $\Theta_0$=254 km s$^{-1}$ for the estimation of kinematic distances, we found that the distribution of HII regions and GMCs can fit the models well, although the results do not change significantly compared to the parameters with the standard $R_0$ and $\Theta_0$.
astro-ph.GA:Carbon solids are ubiquitous material in the interstellar space. However, the formation pathway of carbonaceous matter in astrophysical environments as well as in terrestrial gas-phase condensation reactions is not yet understood. Laser ablation of graphite in different quenching gas atmospheres such as pure He, He/H$_2$, and He/H$_2$O at varying pressures is used to synthesize very small, fullerene-like carbon nanoparticles. The particles are characterized by very small diameters between 1 and 4 nm and a disturbed onion-like structure. The soot particles extracted from the condensation zone obviously represent a very early stage of particle condensation. The spectral properties have been measured from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) ($\lambda$=120 nm) to the mid-infrared (MIR) ($\lambda$=15 ~$\mu$m). The seed-like soot particles show strong absorption bands in the 3.4 ~$\mu$m range. The profile and the intensity pattern of the 3.4 ~$\mu$m band of the diffuse interstellar medium can be well reproduced by the measured 3.4 ~$\mu$m profile of the condensed particles, however, all the carbon which is left to form solids is needed to fit the intensity of the interstellar bands. In contrast to the assumption that onion-like soot particles could be the carrier of the interstellar ultraviolet (UV) bump, our very small onion-like carbon nanoparticles do not show distinct UV bands due to ($\pi-\pi$*) transitions.
astro-ph.GA:Carbonaceous grains represent a major component of cosmic dust. In order to understand their formation pathways, they have been prepared in the laboratory by gas-phase condensation reactions such as laser pyrolysis and laser ablation. Our studies demonstrate that the temperature in the condensation zone determines the formation pathway of carbonaceous particles. At temperatures lower than 1700 K, the condensation by-products are mainly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), that are also the precursors or building blocks for the condensing soot grains. The low-temperature condensates contain PAH mixtures that are mainly composed of volatile 3-5 ring systems. At condensation temperatures higher than 3500 K, fullerene-like carbon grains and fullerene compounds are formed. Fullerene fragments or complete fullerenes equip the nucleating particles. Fullerenes can be identified as soluble components. Consequently, condensation products in cool and hot astrophysical environments such as cool and hot AGB stars or Wolf Rayet stars should be different and should have distinct spectral properties.
astro-ph.GA:We present new radio and X-ray observations of Abell 262. The X-ray residual image provides the first evidence of an X-ray tunnel in this system while the radio data reveal that the central radio source is more than three times larger than previously known. We find that the well-known cluster-center S-shaped radio source B2 0149+35 is surrounded by extended emission to the east and south-west. The south-western extension is co-spatial with the X-ray tunnel seen in our new Chandra images while the eastern extension shows three clumps of emission with the innermost coincident with a faint X-ray cavity. The outer two eastern radio extensions are coincident with a newly detected X-ray depression. We use the projected separation of the emission regions to estimate a lower limit of tau_rep=28 Myr to the outburst repetition timescale of the central AGN. The total energy input into the cluster over multiple outburst episodes is estimated to be 2.2x 10^{58} ergs, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously thought. The total AGN energy output determined from our new observations shows that the source should be capable of offsetting radiative cooling over several outburst episodes.
astro-ph.GA:We present the first large-scale mosaic performed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in the Galactic center. We have produced a 25-pointing mosaic, covering a ~2' x 2' area around Sgr A*. We have detected emission from two high-density molecular tracers, HCN(4-3) and CS(7-6), the latter never before reported in this region. The data have an angular resolution of 4.6" x 3.1", and the spectral window coverage is from -180 km/s to 1490 km/s for HCN(4-3) and from -1605 km/s to 129 km/s for CS(7-6). Both molecular tracers present a very clumpy distribution along the circumnuclear disk (CND), and are detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the southern part of the CND, while they are weaker towards the northern part. Assuming that the clumps are as close to the Galactic center as their projected distances, they are still dense enough to be gravitationally stable against the tidal shear produced by the supermassive black hole. Therefore, the CND is a non-transient structure. This geometrical distribution of both tracers suggests that the southern part of the CND is denser than the northern part. Also, by comparing the HCN(4-3) results with HCN(1-0) results we can see that the northern and the southern parts of the CND have different excitation levels, with the southern part warmer than the northern. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained with the detection of NH3, which traces the warmer and less dense material detected in the inner cavity of the CND. We suggest that we are detecting the origin point where a portion of the CND becomes destabilized and approaches the dynamical center of the Milky Way, possibly being impacted by the southern streamer and heated on its way inwards.
astro-ph.GA:A new chemical model is presented for the carbon-rich circumstellar envelope of the AGB star IRC+10216. The model includes shells of matter with densities that are enhanced relative to the surrounding circumstellar medium. The chemical model uses an updated reaction network including reactions from the RATE06 database and a more detailed anion chemistry. In particular, new mechanisms are considered for the formation of CN-, C3N- and C2H-, and for the reactions of hydrocarbon anions with atomic nitrogen and with the most abundant cations in the circumstellar envelope. New reactions involving H- are included which result in the production of significant amounts of C2H- and CN- in the inner envelope. The calculated radial molecular abundance profiles for the hydrocarbons C2H, C4H and C6H and the cyanopolyynes HC3N and HC5N show narrow peaks which are in better agreement with observations than previous models. Thus, the narrow rings observed in molecular microwave emission surrounding IRC+10216 are interpreted as arising in regions of the envelope where the gas and dust densities are greater than the surrounding circumstellar medium. Our models show that CN- and C2H- may be detectable in IRC+10216 despite the very low theorised radiative electron attachment rates of their parent neutral species. We also show that magnesium isocyanide (MgNC) can be formed in the outer envelope through radiative association involving Mg+ and the cyanopolyyne species.
astro-ph.GA:High mass star formation and the evolution of HII regions have a substantial impact on the morphology and star formation history of molecular clouds. The HII region Gum 48d, located in the Centaurus Arm at a distance of 3.5 kpc, is an old, well evolved HII region whose ionizing stars have moved off the main sequence. As such, it represents a phase in the evolution of HII regions that is less well studied than the earlier, more energetic, main sequence phase. In this paper we use multi-wavelength archive data from a variety of sources to perform a detailed study of this interesting region. Morphologically, Gum 48d displays a ring-like faint HII region associated with diffuse emission from the associated PDR, and is formed from part of a large, massive molecular cloud complex. There is extensive ongoing star formation in the region, at scales ranging from low to high mass, which is consistent with triggered star formation scenarios. We investigate the dynamical history and evolution of this region, and conclude that the original HII region was once larger and more energetic than the faint region currently seen. The proposed history of this molecular cloud complex is one of multiple, linked generations of star formation, over a period of 10 Myr. Gum 48d differs significantly in morphology and star formation that the other HII regions in the molecular cloud; these differences are likely the result of the advanced age of the region, and its different evolutionary status.
astro-ph.GA:AIMS:The aim of this paper is to study the characteristics of the stellar populations and the metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge. We study the entire stellar population, but also retrieve information using only the red clump stars. METHODS: To study the characteristics of the stellar populations and the metallicity distribution in the Galactic bulge, we compared the output of the galaxy model TRILEGAL, which implements the Binney et al. (1997) bulge model, with observations from 2MASS and OGLE-II. A minimisation procedure has been set up to retrieve the best fitting model with different stellar populations and metallicity distributions. RESULTS: Using the TRILEGAL code we find that the best model resembling the characteristics of the Galactic bulge is a model with the distance to the Galactic centre $R_0 = 8.7\pm^{0.57}_{0.43}$ kpc, the major axis ratios of the bar $1:\eta:\zeta = 1 : 0.68\pm_{0.19}^{0.05} : 0.31\pm_{0.04}^{0.06}$, and the angle between the Sun-centre line and the bar $\phi = 15\deg\pm_{12.7}^{13.3}$. Using these parameters the best model is found for a burst of 8 Gyr, although it is almost indistinguishable from models with ages of 9 and 10 Gyr. The metallicity distribution found is consistent with metallicity distributions in the literature based on spectroscopic results.
astro-ph.GA:In this chapter we discuss the X-ray radiation from relativistic accretion disks around supermassive black holes, supposed to exist in the centers of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Our focus is on the X-ray radiation, especially in the Fe K$\alpha$ line which originates in the innermost parts of an accretion disk. Moreover, here we discuss some effects which can disturb the Fe K$\alpha$ profile and cause its rapid and irregular variability, observed in the X-ray spectra of some AGN. We will pay attention to three such effects: perturbations in the disk emissivity, absorbtion by warm absorbers and gravitational microlensing. The X-ray emission from accretion disks around non-rotating (Schwarzschild metric), as well as rotating (Kerr metric) supermassive black holes, is discussed. The X-ray radiation of AGN is probably produced in a compact region near their central supermassive black holes, and can provide us some essential information about the plasma conditions and the space-time geometry in these regions. The goal of this chapter is mainly to present a short overview of some important and recent investigations in this field.
astro-ph.GA:The transition from the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) to the planetary nebula (PN) phase is critical in the shaping of PNe. It is suggested that the most asymmetric PNe are the descendant of massive AGB stars. Since these AGB stars are believed to evolve into heavily obscured post-AGB stars and PNe, the compilation of a sample of bona fide obscured post-AGB stars and PNe is important to help understand the formation of asymmetric PNe. We have used 2MASS, Spitzer GLIMPSE, MSX, and IRAS data in search of the near-IR counterparts of a sample of 165 presumably obscured IRAS post-AGB and PN candidates, and DSS red images to identify the optical counterparts among the objects detected in the near-IR. The IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the wavelength range from 1 to 100 microns of the sources with unambiguous near-IR counterparts have been analyzed using appropriate colour-colour diagrams. We have identified the near-IR counterparts of 119 sources out of the 165 IRAS post-AGB and PN candidates in our sample. The improved astrometric coordinates of these sources have allowed us to find optical counterparts for 59 of them, yielding a reduced sample of 60 optically obscured post-AGB star and PN candidates. Among the 119 sources with near-IR counterparts, only 80 have unambiguous identifications in the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue.
astro-ph.GA:The aim of this study is to investigate systematic chemical differentiation of molecules in regions of high mass star formation. We observed five prominent sites of high mass star formation in HCN, HNC, HCO+, their isotopes, C18O, C34S and some other molecular lines, for some sources both at 3 and 1.3 mm and in continuum at 1.3 mm. Taking into account earlier obtained data for N2H+ we derive molecular abundances and physical parameters of the sources (mass, density, ionization fraction, etc.). The kinetic temperature is estimated from CH3C2H observations. Then we analyze correlations between molecular abundances and physical parameters and discuss chemical models applicable to these species. The typical physical parameters for the sources in our sample are the following: kinetic temperature in the range ~ 30-50 K (it is systematically higher than that obtained from ammonia observations and is rather close to dust temperature), masses from tens to hundreds solar masses, gas densities ~ 10^5 cm^{-3}, ionization fraction ~ 10^{-7}. In most cases the ionization fraction slightly (a few times) increases towards the embedded YSOs. The observed clumps are close to gravitational equilibrium. There are systematic differences in distributions of various molecules. The abundances of CO, CS and HCN are more or less constant. There is no sign of CO and/or CS depletion as in cold cores. At the same time the abundances of HCO+, HNC and especially N2H+ strongly vary in these objects. They anti-correlate with the ionization fraction and as a result decrease towards the embedded YSOs. For N2H+ this can be explained by dissociative recombination to be the dominant destroying process. N2H+, HCO+, and HNC are valuable indicators of massive protostars.
astro-ph.GA:Only massive stars contribute to the chemical evolution of the juvenile universe corresponding to [Fe/H]<-1.5. If Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the only relevant sources, then the abundances in the interstellar medium of the juvenile epoch are simply the sum of different SN II contributions. Both low-mass (~8-11M_sun) and normal (~12-25M_sun) SNe II produce neutron stars, which have intense neutrino-driven winds in their nascent stages. These winds produce elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr through charged-particle reactions (CPR). Such elements are often called the light r-process elements, but are considered here as products of CPR and not the r-process. The observed absence of production of the low-A elements (Na through Zn including Fe) when the true r-process elements (Ba and above) are produced requires that only low-mass SNe II be the site if the r-process occurs in SNe II. Normal SNe II produce the CPR elements in addition to the low-A elements. This results in a two-component model that is quantitatively successful in explaining the abundances of all elements relative to hydrogen for -3<[Fe/H]<-1.5. This model explicitly predicts that [Sr/Fe]>-0.32. Recent observations show that there are stars with [Sr/Fe]<-2 and [Fe/H]<-3. This proves that the two-component model is not correct and that a third component is necessary to explain the observations. This leads to a simple three-component model including low-mass and normal SNe II and hypernovae (HNe), which gives a good description of essentially all the data for stars with [Fe/H]<-1.5. We conclude that HNe are more important than normal SNe II in the chemical evolution of the low-A elements, in sharp distinction to earlier models. (Abridged)
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) Studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential to locating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellar medium. In particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorly understood. Our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database of massive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the Galaxy, to understand how and under what conditions star formation takes place. A well characterized sample of star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass function of high-mass, star-forming clumps. This systematic survey at submm wavelengths also represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA. The APEX telescope is ideally located to observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beam size of 19". Taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellent sensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the Galactic Plane, with a noise level of 50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL). As a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. These data reveal 6000 compact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy, as well as extended structures, many of them filamentary. About two thirds of the compact sources have no bright infrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to the precursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources harbor hot cores, compact HII regions or young embedded clusters. Assuming a typical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc with masses from a few 10 to a few 100 M_sun. In this introductory paper, we show preliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss the perspectives of the survey.
astro-ph.GA:We have used FUSE to obtain thirteen observations of the dwarf nova VW Hyi covering the period from the end of a superoutburst through the following normal outburst of the system. Here, we present the quiescent spectra. They contain at least three components. The dominant component is the white dwarf (WD), which cools following the superoutburst. The amount of cooling depends somewhat on the WD models used. For log g of 8.0, the temperature drops from 24,000K just after the outburst to 20,000 K just before the normal outburst. For this model, and a distance of 65 pc, the WD radius is ~8 x 10**8 cm and v sin(i) is ~420 km/s. The fact that the derived radius is smaller than expected for a WD with log g=8 suggests a higher gravity WD or that VW Hyi is somewhat further than 65 pc. Either is possible given the current distance uncertainty of +-20 pc. Earlier suggestions that the WD photosphere shows evidence of CNO processed material are confirmed, but our analysis also shows that issues remain in terms of analyzing the spectra of WDs in such unusual physical situations. The second component is relatively featureless and shows modulation on the orbital (and just after outburst, the superhump) period. It is likely associated with the hot spot where material from the secondary encounters the disk, rather than the boundary layer region between the inner disk and WD. The second component fades ~10 days after the superoutburst. There is also a third component, clearly visible in broad emission lines of C III 977, N III 991, Lyman Beta and O VI 1032,1038, which appears to be accompanied by a flat continuum. The strength of the emission lines, which are almost surely associated with the accretion disk, appear relatively constant throughout the observations.
astro-ph.GA:We present Spitzer/IRS spectral mapping observations of the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) Arp299 (IC694 + NGC3690) covering the central 45arcsec ~ 9kpc. The integrated mid-IR spectrum of Arp299 is similar to that of local starbursts despite its strongly interacting nature and high infrared luminosity, L_IR ~ 6x10^11 Lsun. This is explained because the star formation (probed by e.g. high [NeIII]15.56micron/[NeII]micron line ratios) is spread across at least 6-8kpc. Moreover, a large fraction of this star formation is taking place in young regions of moderate mid-IR optical depths such as the C+C' complex in the overlap region between the two galaxies and in HII regions in the disks of the galaxies. It is only source A, the nuclear region of IC694, that shows the typical mid-IR characteristics of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, L_IR > 10^12 Lsun), that is, very compact (less than 1kpc) and dust-enshrouded star formation resulting in a deep silicate feature and moderate equivalent widths of the PAHs. The nuclear region of NGC3690, known as source B1, hosts a low-luminosity AGN and is surrounded by regions of star formation. Although the high excitation [NeV]14.32micron line typical of AGN is not detected in B1, its upper limit is consistent with the value expected from the X-ray luminosity. The AGN emission is detected in the form of a strong hot dust component that accounts for 80-90% of the 6micron luminosity of B1. The similarity between the Arp299 integrated mid-IR spectrum and those of high-z ULIRGs suggests that Arp299 may represent a local example, albeit with lower IR luminosity and possibly higher metallicity, of the star-formation processes occurring at high-z.
astro-ph.GA:High-resolution ultraviolet spectra from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) were used to search for unidentified interstellar absorption features in the well studied sightline towards X Per (HD 24534). The significance of features detected was determined from Gaussian fits to the data, as well as the features' persistence in multiple observations. Fixed pattern noise characteristics were studied in STIS echelle data to distinguish between interstellar and instrumental features. We report the detection of two unidentified features that stand out from the more common fixed pattern noise features. Both features have depths of > 3% of the continuum level making them very likely of interstellar origin. Lastly, we comment on possible carriers, and discuss future prospects for studying these and perhaps other unidentified lines in larger samples of sightlines.
astro-ph.GA:We present radial velocity measurements of four wide halo binary candidates from the sample in Chaname & Gould (2004; CG04) which, to date, is the only sample containing a large number of such candidates. The four candidates that we have observed have projected separations >0.1 pc, and include the two widest binaries from the sample, with separations of 0.45 and 1.1 pc. We confirm that three of the four CG04 candidates are genuine, including the one with the largest separation. The fourth candidate, however, is spurious at the 5-sigma level. In the light of these measurements we re-examine the implications for MACHO models of the Galactic halo. Our analysis casts doubt on what MACHO constraints can be drawn from the existing sample of wide halo binaries.
astro-ph.GA:Open clusters have long been used to illuminate both stellar evolution and Galactic evolution. The oldest clusters, though rather rare, can reveal the chemical and nucleosynthetic processes early in the history of the Galaxy. We have studied two turn-off stars in the old, metal-rich open cluster, NGC 6791. The Keck + HIRES spectra have a resolution of 45,000 and signal-to-noise ratios of 40 per pixel. We confirm the high value for [Fe/H] finding +0.30 $\pm$0.08, in agreement with earlier results from evolved stars in other parts of the HR diagram. We have also determined abundances for Na, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Y and Ba. These are compared to a sample of old, metal-rich field stars. With the probable exception of enhanced Ni in the cluster stars, the field and cluster stars show similar abundances of the elements. Model predictions show that the Ni enhancement could result from enrichment of the pre-cluster gas by SN Ia. Orbital evidence indicates that NGC 6791 could have originated near the inner regions of the Galaxy where the metallicity is generally higher than it is in the disk or halo. Subsequent perturbations and migrations may have resulted in its current heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and 1 kpc above the Galactic plane.
astro-ph.GA:The QSO HE0450-2958 was brought to the front scene by the non-detection of its host galaxy and strong upper limits on the latter's luminosity. The QSO is also a powerful infrared emitter, in gravitational interaction with a strongly distorted UltraLuminous InfraRed companion galaxy. We investigate the properties of the companion galaxy, through new near- and mid-infrared observations of the system obtained with NICMOS onboard HST, ISAAC and VISIR on the ESO VLT. The companion galaxy is found to harbour a point source revealed only in the infrared, in what appears as a hole or dark patch in the optical images. Various hypotheses on the nature of this point source are analyzed and it is found that the only plausible one is that it is a strongly reddened AGN hidden behind a thick dust cloud. The hypothesis that the QSO supermassive black hole might have been ejected from the companion galaxy in the course of a galactic collision involving 3-body black holes interaction is also reviewed, on the basis of this new insight on a definitely complex system.
astro-ph.GA:We aim to characterise the properties of a third massive, red supergiant dominated galactic cluster. To accomplish this we utilised a combination of near/mid-IR photometry and spectroscopy to identify and classify the properties of cluster members, and statistical arguments to determine the mass of the cluster. We found a total of 16 strong candidates for cluster membership, for which formal classification of a subset yields spectral types from K3-M4 Ia and luminosities between log(L/L_sun)~4.5-4.8 for an adopted distance of 6+/-1 kpc. For an age in the range of 16-20 Myr, the implied mass is 2-4x10^4 M_sun, making it one of the most massive young clusters in the Galaxy. This discovery supports the hypothesis that a significant burst of star formation occurred at the base of Scutum-Crux arm between 10-20 Myr ago, yielding a stellar complex comprising at least ~10^5M_sun of stars (noting that since the cluster identification criteria rely on the presence of RSGs, we suspect that the true stellar yield will be significantly higher). We highlight the apparent absence of X-ray binaries within the star formation complex and finally, given the physical association of at least two pulsars with this region, discuss the implications of this finding for stellar evolution and the production and properties of neutron stars.
astro-ph.GA:The collapse and fragmentation of initially prolate and oblate, magnetic molecular clouds is calculated in three dimensions with a gravitational, radiative hydrodynamics code. The code includes magnetic field effects in an approximate manner: magnetic pressure, tension, braking, and ambipolar diffusion are all modelled. The parameters varied for both the initially prolate and oblate clouds are the initial degree of central concentration of the radial density profile, the initial angular velocity, and the efficiency of magnetic braking (represented by a factor $f_{mb} = 10^{-4}$ or $10^{-3}$). The oblate cores all collapse to form rings that might be susceptible to fragmentation into multiple systems. The outcome of the collapse of the prolate cores depends strongly on the initial density profile. Prolate cores with central densities 20 times higher than their boundary densities collapse and fragment into binary or quadruple systems, whereas cores with central densities 100 times higher collapse to form single protostars embedded in bars. The inclusion of magnetic braking is able to stifle protostellar fragmentation in the latter set of models, as when identical models were calculated without magnetic braking (Boss 2002), those cores fragmented into binary protostars. These models demonstrate the importance of including magnetic fields in studies of protostellar collapse and fragmentation, and suggest that even when magnetic fields are included, fragmentation into binary and multiple systems remains as a possible outcome of protostellar collapse.
astro-ph.GA:Based on the K\"onigl's inhomogeneous jet model, we estimate the jet parameters, such as bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, viewing angle $\theta$ and electron number density $n_{\rm e}$ from radio VLBI and X-ray data for a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) assuming that the X-rays are from the jet rather than the intracluster gas. The bulk kinetic power of jets is then calculated using the derived jet parameters. We find a strong correlation between the total luminosity of broad emission lines and the bulk kinetic power of the jets. This result supports the scenario that the accretion process are tightly linked with the radio jets, though how the disk and jet are coupled is not revealed by present correlation analysis. Moreover, we find a significant correlation between the bulk kinetic power and radio extended luminosity. This implies that the emission from the radio lobes are closely related with the energy flux transported through jets from the central part of AGNs.
astro-ph.GA:The correlation between black hole masses and stellar velocity dispersions provides an efficient method to determine the masses of black holes in active galaxies. We obtained optical spectra of a Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) galaxy 4C +29.70, using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) equipped with OSIS, in August 6, 2003. Several stellar absorption features, such as Mg I (5175\AA), Ca E band (5269\AA) and Na D (5890\AA), were detected in the spectra. The stellar velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, of the host galaxy, measured from absorption features is $\rm \approx 250 km s^{-1}$. If 4C +29.70 follows the $\rm M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation established for nearby galaxies, then its central black hole has a mass of $\rm \approx3.3\times10^{8}M_{\odot}$. In combination with the black hole masses of seven GPS galaxies in Snellen et al. (2003), we find that the average black hole mass of these eight young radio sources is smaller than that of the Bettoni et al. (2003) sample of extended radio galaxies. This may indicate that young radio sources are likely at the early evolutionary stage of radio galaxies, at which the central black holes may still undergo rapid growth. However, this needs further investigations.
astro-ph.GA:Suzaku observed the Galactic center region near the Radio Arc at ~20' southeast of Sagittarius A*.In the 18'x18' field of view, we found four distinct X-ray sources: a bright star and a diffuse source associated with the star clusters in the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV), a small clump in a higher energy band (4-6 keV), and a peculiar clump in the 6.4 keV line band.The latter two clumps are located at the south end of the Radio Arc. This paper reports on the results, and discusses the origin of these X-ray sources, with a particular emphasis on small clumps.
astro-ph.GA:Optical images and high-dispersion spectra have been obtained of the ejected material surrounding the pulsating AGB star Mira A. The two streams of knots on either side of the star, found in far ultra-viollet (FUV) GALEX images, have now been imaged clearly in the light of Halpha. Spatially resolved profiles of the same line reveal that the bulk of these knots form a bi-polar outflow with radial velocity extremes of +- 150 km/s with respect to the central star. The South stream is approaching and the North stream receding from the observer. A displacement away from Mira A between the position of one of the South stream knots in the new Halpha image and its position in the previous Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS I) red plate has been noted. If interpreted as a consequence of expansion proper motions the bipolar outflow is tilted at 69deg +- 2deg to the plane of the sky, has an outflow velocity of 160 +- 10 km/s and is ~1000 y old.
astro-ph.GA:Recent investigations have revealed a surprising lack of close binaries among extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars in the globular cluster NGC6752, at variance with the analogous sdB field stars. Another puzzling result concerns the derived spectroscopic masses for some EHB stars. The present paper extends our study of NGC6752 to M80 and NGC5986. Twenty-one horizontal branch stars (out of which 5 EHBs) in NGC5986 and 31 in M80 (11 EHBs) were observed during four consecutive nights. We measured radial velocity variations, temperatures, gravities, and helium abundances. By means of a statistical analysis, we detected one EHB close binary candidate per cluster. In M80, the best estimate of the close binary EHB fraction is f=12%, and even the lowest estimate of the binary fraction among field sdB stars can be ruled out within a 90% confidence level. Because of the small observed sample, no strong conclusions can be drawn on the close EHB binary fraction for NGC5986, although our best estimate is rather low (f=25%). For the discrepancy in spectroscopic derived masses with theoretical models observed in NGC6752, our analysis of M80 EHB stars shows a similar trend. For the first time, we report a clear trend in surface helium abundance with temperature. Our results show that the deficiency of close binaries among EHB stars is now confirmed in two, and possibly three, globular clusters. This feature is therefore not a peculiarity of NGC6752. Our analysis also proves that the strangely high spectroscopic masses among EHB stars are now confirmed in at least a second cluster. Our results confirm that f could be a function of the age of the sdB star population, but we find that recent models have some problem reproducing all observations.
astro-ph.GA:The goals of this work are to develop a new method to separate early and late type stellar components of a dense stellar cluster based on narrow band filters, to apply it to the central parsec of the GC, and to conduct a population analysis of this area. We use AO assisted observations obtained at the ESO VLT in the NIR H-band and 7 intermediate bands covering the NIR K-band. A comparison of the resulting SEDs with a blackbody of variable extinction then allows us to determine the presence and strength of a CO absorption feature to distinguish between early and late type stars. The new method is suitable to classify K giants (and later) as well as B2 main sequence (and earlier) stars which are brighter than 15.5 mag in the K band in the central parsec. Compared to previous spectroscopic investigations that are limited to 13-14 mag, this represents a major improvement in the depth of the observations as well as reducing the needed observation time. We classify 312 stars as early type candidates out of a sample of 5914 sources. The distribution of the early type stars can be fitted with a steep power law (beta(R>1'') = -1.49 +/- 0.12, alternatively with a broken power law, beta(R=1-10'') = -1.08 +/- 0.12, beta(R=10-20'') = -3.46 +/- 0.58, since we find a drop of the early type density at ~10''). We also detect early type candidates outside of 0.5 pc in significant numbers for the first time. The late type density function shows an inversion in the inner 6'', with a power law slope of beta(R<6'') = 0.17 +/- 0.09. The late type KLF has a power law slope of 0.30$\pm$0.01, closely resembling the KLF obtained for the bulge of the Milky Way. The early type KLF has a much flatter slope of 0.14 +/- 0.02. Our results agree best with an in-situ star formation scenario.
astro-ph.GA:The massive Arches cluster near the Galactic center should be an ideal laboratory for investigating massive star formation under extreme conditions. But it comes at a high price: the cluster is hidden behind several tens of magnitudes of visual extinction. Severe crowding requires space or AO-assisted instruments to resolve the stellar populations, and even with the best instruments interpreting the data is far from direct. Several investigations using NICMOS and the most advanced AO imagers on the ground revealed an overall top-heavy IMF for the cluster, with a very flat IMF near the center. There are several effects, however, that could potentially bias these results, in particular the strong differential extinction and the problem of transforming the observations into a standard photometric system in the presence of strong reddening. We present new observations obtained with the NAOS-Conica (NACO) AO-imager on the VLT. The problem of photometric transformation is avoided by working in the natural photometric system of NACO, and we use a Bayesian approach to determine masses and reddenings from the broad-band IR colors. A global value of $\Gamma=-1.1 \pm 0.2$ for the high-mass end ($M>10M_{\sun}$) of the IMF is obtained, and we conclude that a power law of Salpeter slope cannot be discarded for the Arches cluster. The flattening of the IMF towards the center is confirmed, but is less severe than previously thought. We find $\Gamma=-0.88\pm0.20$, which is incompatible with previous determinations. Within 0.4 pc we derive a total mass of $\sim2.0(\pm0.6)\times10^{4}M_{\sun}$ for the cluster and a central mass density $\rho = 2(\pm0.4)\times10^{5} M_{\sun}pc^{-3}$ that confirms Arches as the densest known young massive cluster in the Milky Way.
astro-ph.GA:We present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of massive stars in three stellar clusters located in the direction of the inner Galaxy. One of them, the Quartet, is a new discovery while the other two were previously reported as candidate clusters identified on mid-infrared Spitzer images (GLIMPSE20 and GLIMPSE13). Using medium-resolution (R=900-1320) H and K spectroscopy, we firmly establish the nature of the brightest stars in these clusters, yielding new identifications of an early WC and two Ofpe/WN9 stars in the Quartet and an early WC star in GLIMPSE20. We combine this information with the available photometric measurements from 2MASS, to estimate cluster masses, ages, and distances. The presence of several massive stars places the Quartet and GLIMPSE20 among the small sample of known Galactic stellar clusters with masses of a few 10^3 Msun, and ages from 3 to 8 Myr. We estimate a distance of about 3.5 kpc for Glimpse 20, and 6.0 kpc for Quartet. The large number of giant stars identified in GLIMPSE13 indicates that it is another massive (~ 6500 Msun) cluster, but older, with an age between 30 and 100 Myr, at a distance of about 3 kpc.
astro-ph.GA:Supernova explosions inject a considerable amount of energy into the interstellar medium (ISM) in regions with high to moderate star formation rates. In order to assess whether the driving of turbulence by supernovae is also important in the outer Galactic disk, where the star formation rates are lower, we study the spatial distribution of molecular cloud (MC) inclinations with respect to the Galactic plane. The latter contains important information on the nature of the mechanism of energy injection into the ISM. We analyze the spatial correlations between the position angles (PAs) of a selected sample of MCs (the largest clouds in the catalogue of the outer Galaxy published by Heyer et al. 2001). Our results show that when the PAs of the clouds are all mapped to values into the [0,90]degrees interval, there is a significant degree of spatial correlation between the $PA$s on spatial scales in the range of 100-800 pc. These scales are of the order of the sizes of individual SN shells in low density environments such as those prevailing in the outer Galaxy and where the metallicity of the ambient gas is of the order of the solar value or smaller. These findings suggest that individual SN explosions, occurring in the outer regions of the Galaxy and in likewise spiral galaxies, albeit at lower rates, continue to play an important role in shaping the structure and dynamics of the ISM in those regions. The SN explosions we postulate here are likely associated with the existence of young stellar clusters in the far outer regions of the Galaxy and the UV emission and low levels of star formation observed with the GALEX satellite in the outer regions of local galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:We identify, categorize, and quantify alignment effects among host and satellite galaxies using a spectroscopically-confirmed, low-redshift (z<0.23) galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6. Consistent with other recent findings, we find that satellite galaxies (SGs) of red, centrally concentrated (elliptical) host galaxies (HGs) with radial velocity separation |Delta_V|<600 km/s preferentially reside near the projected major axes of their HGs. Among these, this preference is strongest for highly concentrated, red SGs. We find that fractional anisotropy increases with decreasing \Delta_V and Delta_R and is nearly 40% greater among the closest SGs (Delta_R<250 kpc/h) relative to more distant (Delta_R>500 kpc/h) SGs. For highly concentrated SGs at small (<300 kpc/h) projected separation, we observe a strong radial (hostward) alignment signal in isophotal position angles (PAs) due to isophotal twisting and contamination that is not present when using galaxy model PAs. Among objects for which both isophotal and galaxy model PAs agree to <15 degrees, this elongation signal is significantly weaker. We also investigate the "Holmberg Effect," a well-known result wherein nearby (<40 kpc/h) SGs of large, inclined spiral HGs were seen to preferentially reside near the minor axes of their HGs. Survey limitations preclude a strict test of this effect using only SDSS spectroscopic galaxies. By adopting a looser set of cuts than those of Holmberg's study, we recover a comparable preference among faint blue SGs for the HG minor axis at marginal significance (~3 sigma). We conclude that several types of alignment likely exist among different galaxy populations, but that the observed nature and strength of alignment trends depend sensitively on both selection criteria and on the method used to determine galaxy orientation.
astro-ph.GA:A study of the blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy Mrk 996 based on high resolution optical VLT VIMOS integral field unit spectroscopy is presented. Mrk 996 displays multi-component line emission, with most line profiles consisting of a narrow, central Gaussian with an underlying broad component. The broad HI Balmer component splits into two separate broad components inside a 1".5 radius from the nucleus; these are attributed to a two-armed mini-spiral. The rotation curve of Mrk 996 derived from the H\alpha narrow component yields a total mass of 5x10^8 Msol within a radius of 3 kpc.   The high excitation energy, high critical density [O III] 4363 and [N II] 5755 lines are only detected from the inner region and exist purely in broad component form, implying unusual excitation conditions. Surface brightness, radial velocity, and FWHM maps for several emission components are presented. A separate physical analysis of the broad and narrow emission line regions is undertaken. We derive an upper limit of 10,000 K for the electron temperature of the narrow line gas, together with an electron density of 170 cm^-3, typical of normal H II regions. For the broad line component, we estimate a temperature of 11,000 K and an electron density of 10^7 cm^-3. The broad line emission regions show a N/H enrichment factor of ~20 relative to the narrow line regions, but no He/H, O/H, S/H, or Ar/H enrichment is inferred. The dominant line excitation mechanism is photoionisation by the ~3000 WR stars and ~150,000 O-type stars estimated to be present in the core. This is indeed a peculiar BCD, with extremely dense zones of gas in the core, through which stellar outflows and possible shock fronts permeate contributing to the excitation of the broad line emission. [Abridged]
astro-ph.GA:The properties of polarization in scattered light by aligned ellipsoidal grains are investigated with the Fredholm integral equation method (FIM) and the T-matrix method (Tmat), and the results are applied to the observed circular polarization in OMC1. We assume that the grains are composed of silicates and ellipsoidal (oblate, prolate, or tri-axial ellipsoid) in shape with a typical axial ratio of 2:1. The angular dependence of circular polarization p_c on directions of incident and scattered light is investigated with spherical harmonics and associated Legendre polynomials. The degree of circular polarization p_c also depends on the Rayleigh reduction factor R which is a measure of imperfect alignment. We find that p_c is approximately proportional to R for grains with |m|x_{eq} < 3 - 5, where x_{eq} is the dimensionless size parameter and m is the refractive index of the grain. Models that include those grains can explain the observed large circular polarization in the near infrared, ~15%, in the south-east region of the BN object (SEBN) in OMC1, if the directions of incidence and scattering of light is optimal, and if grain alignment is strong, i.e. R > 0.5. Such a strong alignment cannot be explained by the Davis-Greenstein mechanism; we prefer instead an alternative mechanism driven by radiative torques. If the grains are mixed with silicates and ice, the degree of circular polarization p_c decreases in the 3 micron ice feature, while that of linear polarization increases. This wavelength dependence is different from that predicted in a process of dichroic extinction.
astro-ph.GA:We use mid-infrared spectroscopy of unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to reveal their native dusty environments. We concentrate on Seyfert 1 galaxies, observing a sample of 31 with the Infrared Spectrograph aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, and compare them with 21 higher-luminosity quasar counterparts. Silicate dust reprocessing dominates the mid-infrared spectra, and we generally measure the 10 and 18 micron spectral features weakly in emission in these galaxies. The strengths of the two silicate features together are sensitive to the dust distribution. We present numerical radiative transfer calculations that distinguish between clumpy and smooth geometries, which are applicable to any central heating source, including stars as well as AGNs. In the observations, we detect the obscuring ``torus'' of unified AGN schemes, modeling it as compact and clumpy. We also determine that star formation increases with AGN luminosity, although the proportion of the galaxies' bolometric luminosity attributable to stars decreases with AGN luminosity.
astro-ph.GA:We report the discovery of a previously unknown massive Galactic star cluster at l=29.22, b=-0.20. Identified visually in mid-IR images from the Spitzer GLIMPSE survey, the cluster contains at least 8 late-type supergiants, based on followup near-IR spectroscopy, and an additional 3-6 candidate supergiant embers having IR photometry consistent with a similar distance and reddening. The cluster lies at a local minimum in the 13-CO column density and 8 micron emission. We interpret this feature as a hole carved by the energetic winds of the evolving massive stars. The 13-CO hole seen in molecular maps at V_LSR ~95 km/s corresponds to near/far kinematic distances of 6.1/8.7+/-1 kpc. We calculate a mean spectrophotometric distance of 7.0^+3.7_-2.4 kpc, broadly consistent with the kinematic distances inferred. This location places it near the northern end of the Galactic bar. For the mean extinction of A_V=12.6+/-0.5 mag (A_K=1.5+/-0.1 mag), the color-magnitude diagram of probable cluster members is well fit by isochrones in the age range 18-24 Myr. The estimated cluster mass is ~20,000 Msun. With the most massive original cluster stars likely deceased, no strong radio emission is detected in this vicinity. As such, this RSG cluster is representative of adolescent massive Galactic clusters that lie hidden behind many magnitudes of dust obscuration. This cluster joins two similar red supergiant clusters as residents of the volatile region where the end of our Galaxy's bar joins the base of the Scutum-Crux piral arm, suggesting a recent episode of widespread massive star formation there.
astro-ph.GA:This White Paper, submitted to the National Academy of Sciences' Astro2010 Decadal Review Committee, focuses on 2 central themes in the study of young brown dwarfs -- their formation mechanism and disk characteristics -- which are of direct relevance to fundamental questions of stellar and planetary origins and properties.
astro-ph.GA:We calculate the absorption efficiency of the composite grains, made up of host silicate spheroids and inclusions of ices/graphites/or voids, in the spectral region $7.0-14.0\mu$m The absorption efficiencies of the composite spheroidal grains for three axial ratios are computed using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) as well as using the effective medium approximation & T-Matrix (EMT-Tmatrix) ap proach. We study the absorption as a function of the volume fraction of the inclusions and porosity. In particular, we study the variation in the $10.0\mu$m feature with the volume fraction of the inclusions and porosity. We then calculate the infrared fluxes for these composite grains and compare the model curves with the average observed IRAS-LRS curve, obtained for several circumstellar dust shells around stars. These results on the composite grains show that the wavelength of the peak absorption shifts and the width of the $10.0\mu$m feature varies with the variation in the volume fraction of the inclusions. The model curves for composite grains with axial ratios not very large (AR$\sim$1.3) and volume fractions of inclusions with f=0.20, and dust temperature of about 250-300$^{\circ}$K, fit the observed emission curves reasonably well.
astro-ph.GA:Simultaneous multifrequency observations of the Crab pulsar giant pulses (GPs) were performed with the 64-m Kalyazin radio telescope at four frequencies 0.6, 1.4, 2.2 and 8.3 GHz using the K5 VLBI recording terminal. The K5 terminal provided continuous recording in 16 4-MHz wide frequency channels distributed over 4 frequency bands. Several thousands of GPs were detected during about 6 hours of observations in two successive days in July 2005. Radio spectra of single GPs were analysed at separate frequencies and over whole frequency range. These spectra manifest notable modulation over frequency ranges, $\Delta\nu$, both on large ($\Delta\nu/\nu\approx 0.5$) and small ($\Delta\nu/\nu\approx 0.01$) frequency scales. Cross-correlation analysis of GPs at 2.2 GHz showed that their pulse shapes can be interpreted as an ensemble of unresolved bursts grouped together at time scales of $\approx 1$ mcs being well-correlated over a 60-MHz band. The corresponding GP cross-correlation functions do not obey the predictions of the amplitude-modulated noise model of Rickett (1975), thus indicating that unresolved components represent a small number of elementary emitters.
astro-ph.GA:Almost all stars in the 1-8 Msun range evolve through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), preplanetary nebula (PPN) and planetary nebula (PN) evolutionary phases. Most stars that leave the main sequence in a Hubble time will end their lives in this way. The heavy mass loss which occurs during the AGB phase is important across astrophysics, and the particulate matter crucial for the birth of new solar systems is made and ejected by AGB stars. Yet stellar evolution from the beginning of the AGB phase to the PN phase remains poorly understood. We do not understand how the mass-loss (rate, geometry, temporal history) depends on fundamental stellar parameters or the presence of a binary companion. While the study of evolved non-massive stars has maintained a relatively modest profile in recent decades, we are nonetheless in the midst of a quiet but exciting revolution in this area, driven by new observational results, such as the discovery of jets and disks in stellar environments where these were never expected, and by the recognition of new symmetries such as multipolarity and point-symmetry occuring frequently in the nebulae resulting from the outflows. In this paper we summarise the major unsolved problems in this field, and specify the areas where allocation of effort and resources is most likely to help make significant progress.
astro-ph.GA:We have performed observations of water maser emission towards a sample of low-mass protostars, in order to investigate the properties of jets associated with the earliest stages of star formation and their interaction with the surrounding medium. The main aim is to measure the absolute positions and proper motions of the H_2O spots in order to investigate the kinematics of the region from where the jet is launched. We imaged the protostars in the nearby region NGC 1333-IRAS 4 in the water maser line at 22.2 GHz by using the VLBA in phase-reference mode at the milliarcsecond scale over four epochs, spaced by one month to measure proper motions. Two protostars (A2 and B) were detected in a highly variable H_2O maser emission, with an active phase shorter than four weeks. The H_2O maps allow us to trace the fast jet driven by the B protostar: we observed both the red- and blue-shifted lobes very close to the protostar, =< 35 AU, moving away with projected velocities of ~10-50 km/s. The comparison with the molecular outflow observed at larger scale suggests a jet precession with a 18'/yr rate. By measuring the positional spread of the H_2O spots we estimate a jet width of ~2 AU at a distance of ~12 AU from the driving protostar.
astro-ph.GA:In this paper we have analyzed IUE high resolution spectra of the central star (BD+602522) of the Bubble nebula. We discuss velocities of the different regions along the line of sight to the bubble. We find that the Bubble Nebula is younger (by a factor of 100) than the exciting star suggesting that either the bubble is expanding into an inhomogenuous interstellar medium or that the mechanics of the stellar wind are not fully understood.
astro-ph.GA:We use 14 orbits of ACS observations to reach the end of the white-dwarf cooling sequence in the globular cluster M4. Our photometry and completeness tests show that the end is located at magnitude m_F606W = 28.5+/-0.1, which implies an age of 11.6+/-0.6 Gyr (internal errors only). This is consistent with the age from fits to the main sequence turn-off (12.0+/-1.4 Gyr).
astro-ph.GA:A deep wide-field image in the light of the Halpha+[N II] emission lines, of the planetary nebula HFG1 which surrounds the precataclysmic binary system V664 Cas, has revealed a tail of emission at least 20' long, at a position angle of 316deg. Evidence is presented which suggests that this is an ~10^5 y old trail of shocked material, left behind V664 Cas as it ejects matter whilst ploughing through its local interstellar media at anywhere between 29 and 59 km/s depending on its distance from the Sun.
astro-ph.GA:Electromagnetic streaming instabilities of multicomponent collisional magnetized accretion disks are studied. Sufficiently ionized regions of the disk are explored where there is strong collisional coupling of neutral atoms with both ions and dust grains simultaneously. The steady state is investigated in detail and the azimuthal and radial background velocities of species are calculated. The azimuthal velocity of ions, dust grains, and neutrals is found to be less than the Keplerian velocity. The radial velocity of neutrals and dust grains is shown to be directed inward of the disk. The general solution for the perturbed velocities of species taking into account collisions and thermal pressure is obtained. The effect on the collisional frequencies, due to density perturbations of charged species and neutrals, is included. It is shown that dust grains can be involved in the fast electromagnetic perturbations induced by the ions and electrons through the strong collisions of these grains with neutrals that in turn have a strong collisional coupling with the ions. The dispersion relation for the vertical perturbations is derived and its unstable solutions due to different background velocities of ions and electrons are found. The growth rates of the streaming instabilities considered can be much larger than the Keplerian frequency.
astro-ph.GA:We have measured the amount of kinematic substructure in the Galactic halo using the final data set from the Spaghetti project, a pencil-beam high latitude sky survey. Our sample contains 101 photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed giants with accurate distance, radial velocity and metallicity information. We have developed a new clustering estimator: the "4distance" measure, which when applied to our data set leads to the identification of 1 group and 7 pairs of clumped stars. The group, with 6 members, can confidently be matched to tidal debris of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Two pairs match the properties of known Virgo structures. Using models of the disruption of Sagittarius in Galactic potentials with different degrees of dark halo flattening, we show that this favors a spherical or prolate halo shape, as demonstrated by Newberg et al. (2007) using SDSS data. One additional pair can be linked to older Sagittarius debris. We find that 20% of the stars in the Spaghetti data set are in substructures. From comparison with random data sets we derive a very conservative lower limit of 10% to the amount of substructure in the halo. However, comparison to numerical simulations shows that our results are also consistent with a halo entirely built up from disrupted satellites, provided the dominating features are relatively broad due to early merging or relatively heavy progenitor satellites.
astro-ph.GA:We describe a technique for probing the statistical properties of cosmic magnetic fields based on radio polarimetry data. Second-order magnetic field statistics like the power spectrum cannot always distinguish between magnetic fields with essentially different spatial structure. Synchrotron polarimetry naturally allows certain 4th-order magnetic field statistics to be inferred from observational data, which lifts this degeneracy and can thereby help us gain a better picture of the structure of the cosmic fields and test theoretical scenarios describing magnetic turbulence. In this work we show that a 4th-order correlator of physical interest, the tension-force spectrum, can be recovered from the polarized synchrotron emission data. We develop an estimator for this quantity based on polarized-emission observations in the Faraday-rotation-free frequency regime. We consider two cases: a statistically isotropic field distribution, and a statistically isotropic field superimposed on a weak mean field. In both cases the tension force power spectrum is measurable; in the latter case, the magnetic power spectrum may also be obtainable. The method is exact in the idealized case of a homogeneous relativistic-electron distribution that has a power-law energy spectrum with a spectral index p=3, and assumes statistical isotropy of the turbulent field. We carry out tests of our method using synthetic data generated from numerically simulated magnetic fields. We show that the method is valid, that it is not prohibitively sensitive to the value of the electron spectral index, and that the observed tension-force spectrum allows one to distinguish between, e.g., a randomly tangled magnetic field (a default assumption in many studies) and a field organized in folded flux sheets or filaments.
astro-ph.GA:We discuss a new type of dust acceleration mechanism that acts in a turbulent magnetized medium. The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence can accelerate grains through resonant as well as nonresonant interactions. We show that the magnetic compression provides higher velocities for super-Alfvenic turbulence and can accelerate an extended range of grains in warm media compared to gyroresonance. While fast modes dominate the acceleration for the large grains, slow modes can be important for sub-micron grains. We provide comprehensive discussion of all the possible grain acceleration mechanisms in interstellar medium. We show that supersonic velocities are attainable for Galactic dust grains. We discuss the consequence of the acceleration. The implications for extinction curve, grain alignment, chemical abundance, etc, are provided.
astro-ph.GA:Ammonia is one of the best tracers of cold dense cores. It is also a minor constituent of interstellar ices and, as such, one of the important nitrogen reservoirs in the protosolar nebula, together with the gas phase nitrogen, in the form of N2 and N. An important diagnostic of the various nitrogen sources and reservoirs of nitrogen in the Solar System is the 14N/15N isotopic ratio. While good data exist for the Solar System, corresponding measurements in the interstellar medium are scarce and of low quality. Following the successful detection of the singly, doubly, and triply deuterated isotopologues of ammonia, we have searched for 15NH2D in dense cores, as a new tool for investigating the 14N/15N ratio in dense molecular gas. With the IRAM-30m telescope, we have obtained deep integrations of the ortho 15NH2D (1(1,1)-1(0,1)) line at 86.4 GHz, simultaneously with the corresponding ortho NH2D line at 85.9 GHz. o-15NH2D is detected in Barnard-1b, NGC1333-DCO+, and L1689N, while we obtained upper limits towards LDN1544 and NGC1333-IRAS4A, and a tentative detection towards L134N(S). The 14N/15N abundance ratio in NH2D ranges between 350 and 850, similar to the protosolar value of ~ 424, and likely higher than the terrestrial ratio of 270.
astro-ph.GA:Photon-dominated regions (PDRs) are powerful molecular line emitters in external galaxies. They are expected in galaxies with high rates of massive star formation due to either starburst (SB) events or starburst coupled with active galactic nuclei (AGN) events. We have explored the PDR chemistry for a range of physical conditions representing a variety of galaxy types. Our main result is a demonstration of the sensitivity of the chemistry to changes in the physical conditions. We adopt crude estimates of relevant physical parameters for several galaxy types and use our models to predict suitable molecular tracers of those conditions. The set of recommended molecular tracers differs from that which we recommended for use in galaxies with embedded massive stars. Thus, molecular observations can in principle be used to distinguish between excitation by starburst and by SB+AGN in distant galaxies. Our recommendations are intended to be useful in preparing Herschel and ALMA proposals to identify sources of excitation in galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:We present an analysis of star-forming gas cores in an SPH simulation of a Giant Molecular Cloud. We identify cores using their deep potential wells. This yields a smoother distribution with clearer boundaries than density. Additionally, this gives an indication of future collapse, as bound potential cores (p-cores) represent the earliest stages of fragmentation in molecular clouds. We find that the mass function of the p-cores resembles the stellar IMF and the observed clump mass function, although p-core masses (~0.7 Msol) are smaller than typical density clumps. The bound p-cores are generally subsonic, have internal substructure, and are only quasi-spherical. We see no evidence of massive bound cores supported by turbulence. We trace the evolution of the p-cores forward in time, and investigate the connection between the original p-core mass and the stellar mass that formed from it. We find that there is a poor correlation, with considerable scatter suggesting accretion onto the core is dependent on more factors than just the initial core mass. During the accretion process the p-cores accrete from beyond the region first bound, highlighting the importance of the core environment to its subsequent evolution.
astro-ph.GA:We present high resolution (R = 60,000) measurements of the NaI D1 and D2 (5890 A) and CaII K (3933 A) interstellar absorption line profiles recorded towards several post-AGB stars located within the M13 and M15 globular clusters, supplemented with a lower resolution spectrum of the CaII K-line observed in absorption towards an Ofpe/WN9 star in the central region of the M33 galaxy. The normalized interstellar absorption profiles have been fit with cloud component velocities, doppler widths and column densities in order to investigate the kinematics and physical conditions of the neutral and partially ionized gas observed along each sight-line. Our CaII observations towards M13 have revealed 4 absorption components that can be identified with galactic Intermediate Velocity Clouds (IVCs) spanning the -50 > Vlsr > -80 km/s range. The NaI/CaII ratio for these IVC's is<0.3, which characterizes the gas as being warm (T=1000 K) and partially ionized. Similar observations towards two stars within M15 have revealed absorption due to a galactic IVC at Vlsr=+65 km/s. This IVC is revealed to have considerable velocity structure, requiring at least 3 cloud components to fit the observed NaI and CaII profiles. CaII K-line observations of a sight-line towards the center of the M33 galaxy have revealed at least 10 cloud components. A cloud at Vlsr=-130 km/s is either an IVC associated with the M33 galaxy occurring at +45 km/s with respect to the M33 local standard of rest, or it is a newly discovered HVC associated with our own Galaxy. In addition, 4 clouds have been discovered in the -165 > Vlsr > -205 km/s range. Three of these clouds are identified with the disk gas of M33, whereas a component at - 203 km/s could be IVC gas in the surrounding halo of M33.
astro-ph.GA:We present observations of L1155 and L1148 in the Cepheus molecular cloud, taken using the FIS instrument on the Akari satellite. We compare these data to submillimetre data taken using the SCUBA camera on the JCMT, and far-infrared data taken with the ISOPHOT camera on board the ISO satellite. All of the data show a relation between the position of the peak of emission and the wavelength for the core of L1155. We interpret this as a temperature gradient. We fit modified blackbody curves to the spectral energy distributions at two positions in the core and see that the central core in L1155 (L1155C) is approximately 2 degrees warmer at one edge than it is in the centre. We consider a number of possible heating sources and conclude that the A6V star BD+67 1263 is the most likely candidate. This star is at a distance of 0.7 pc from the front of L1155C in the plane of the sky. We carry out radiative transfer modelling of the L1155C core including the effects from the nearby star. We find that we can generate a good fit to the observed data at all wavelengths, and demonstrate that the different morphologies of the core at different wavelengths can be explained by the observed 2 degree temperature gradient. The L1148 core exhibits a similar morphology to that of L1155C, and the data are also consistent with a temperature gradient across the core. In this case, the most likely heating source is the star BD197053. Our findings illustrate very clearly that the apparent observed morphology of a pre-stellar core can be highly dependent on the wavelength of the observation, and that temperature gradients must be taken into account before converting images into column density distributions. This is important to note when interpreting Akari and Spitzer data and will also be significant for Herschel data.
astro-ph.GA:The cosmological evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is important for understanding the mechanism of accretion onto supermassive black holes, and the related evolution of the host galaxy. In this work, we include objects with very low Eddington ratio (10^{-3} - 10^{-2}) in an evolution scenario, and compare the results with the observed local distribution of black holes. We test several possibilities for the AGN population, considering obscuration and dependence with luminosity, and investigate the role of the Eddington ratio and radiative accretion efficiency on the shape of the evolved mass function. We find that three distinct populations of AGN can evolve with a wider parameter range than is usually considered, and still be consistent with the local mass function. In general, the black holes in our solutions are spinning rapidly. Taking fixed values for accretion efficiency and Eddington ratio neither provides a full knowledge of the evolution mechanism nor is consistent with the existence of low Eddington ratio objects.
astro-ph.GA:We present the first 3D spectroscopic observations of a nearby HI detected poststarburst, or E+A, galaxy, SDSS J230743.41+152558.4, obtained with the VIMOS IFU spectrograph at ESO VLT. Using the NBursts full spectral fitting technique, we derive maps of stellar kinematics, age, and metallicity out to 2-3 half-light radii. Our analysis reveals a large-scale rapidly rotating disc (v_circ = 300km/s) with a positive age gradient (0.6 to 1.5 Gyr), and a very metal-rich central region ([Fe/H]=+0.25 dex). If a merger or interaction is responsible for triggering the starburst, the presence of this undisturbed disc suggests a minor merger with a gas-rich satellite as the most plausible option, rather than a disruptive major merger. We find spectroscopic evidence for the presence of a LINER or AGN. This is an important clue to the feedback mechanism that truncated the starburst. The presently observed quiescent phase may well be a temporary episode in the galaxy's life. SDSS J230743.41+152558.4 is gas-rich and may restart forming stars, again becoming blue before finally settling at the red sequence.
astro-ph.GA:We present a multiwavelength photometric analysis of the globular cluster M2. The data-set has been obtained by combining high-resolution (HST/WFPC2 and ACS) and wide-field (GALEX) space observations and ground based (MEGACAM-CFHT, EMMI-NTT) images. The photometric sample covers the entire cluster extension from the very central regions up to the tidal radius and beyond. It allows an accurate determination of the cluster center of gravity and other structural parameters derived from the star count density profile. Moreover we study the BSS population and its radial distribution. A total of 123 BSS has been selected, and their radial distribution has been found to be bimodal (highly peaked in the center, decreasing at intermediate radii and rising outward), as already found in a number of other clusters. The radial position of the minimum of the BSS distribution is consistent with the radius of avoidance caused by the dynamical friction of massive objects over the cluster age. We also searched for gradients in the red giant branch (RGB) and the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) populations. At the $2\sigma$ level we found an overabundance of AGB stars within the core radius and confirmed the result of Sohn et al.(1996) that the central region of M2 is bluer than the outer part. We show that the latter is due to a deficit of very luminous RGB stars in the central region.
astro-ph.GA:Two WSRT observations were performed and five archival VLA data were reduced in order to redetect the enigmatic radio transient GCRT J1745-3009. The source was not redetected. We were, however, able to extract important new information from the discovery dataset. Our reanalysis excludes models that predict symmetric bursts, but the transient white dwarf pulsar is favoured. Although we now have more contraints on the properties of this source, we are still unsure about its basic model.
astro-ph.GA:We present ATCA interferometric observations of the old (13 Myr), nearby (86pc) classical T Tauri star, PDS 66. Unresolved 3 and 12 mm continuum emission is detected towards PDS 66, and upper limits are derived for the 3 and 6 cm flux densities. The mm-wave data show a spectral slope flatter than that expected for ISM-sized dust particles, which is evidence of grain growth. We also present HST/NICMOS 1.1 micron PSF-subtracted coronagraphic imaging of PDS 66. The HST observations reveal a bilaterally symmetric circumstellar region of dust scattering about 0.32% of the central starlight, declining radially in surface brightness. The light-scattering disk of material is inclined 32 degrees from face-on, and extends to a radius of 170 AU. These data are combined with published optical and longer wavelength observations to make qualitative comparisons between the median Taurus and PDS 66 spectral energy distributions (SEDs). By comparing the near-infrared emission to a simple model, we determine that the location of the inner disk radius is consistent with the dust sublimation radius (1400 K at 0.1 AU). We place constraints on the total disk mass using a flat-disk model and find that it is probably too low to form gas giant planets according to current models. Despite the fact that PDS 66 is much older than a typical classical T Tauri star (< 5 Myr), its physical properties are not much different.
astro-ph.GA:Helium has been proposed as the key element to interpret the observed multiple main sequences (MS), subgiant branches (SGB) and red giant branches (RGB), as well as the complex horizontal branch (HB) morphology in Globular Clusters (GC). However, up to now, He was never directly measured in suitable GC stars (8500<Teff<11500 K) with the purpose of verify this hypothesis. We studied 7 hot blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars (Teff<11500 K) in the GC NGC 6752 with the purpose to measure their Helium content. In addition Fe,Cr,Si,Ti,O,Na, and Ba abundances were measured. We could measure He abundance only for stars warmer than Teff=8500 K. All our targets with measurable He are zero age HB (ZAHB) objects and turned out to have a homogeneous He content with a mean value of Y=0.245+-0.012, compatible with the most recent measurements of the primordial He content of the Universe (Y~0.25). The whole sample of stars have a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.56+-0.03 and [alpha/Fe]=+0.21+-0.03. Our HB targets show the same Na-O anticorrelation identified among the TO-SGB-RGB stars. This is the first direct measurement of the He abundance for a significative sample of GC stars in a temperature regime where the He content is not altered by sedimentation processing or extreme mixing as suggested for the hottest, late helium flasher HB stars.
astro-ph.GA:Near-future surveys promise a dramatic improvement in the number and precision of astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic measurements of stars in the Milky Way's disk. We examine the impact of such surveys on our understanding of the Galaxy by "observing" particle realizations of non-axisymmetric disk distributions orbiting in an axisymmetric halo with appropriate errors and then attempting to recover the underlying potential using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We demonstrate that the azimuthally averaged gravitational force field in the Galactic plane--and hence, to a lesser extent, the Galactic mass distribution--can be tightly constrained over a large range of radii using a variety of types of surveys so long as the error distribution of the measurements of the parallax, proper motion and radial velocity are well-understood and the disk is surveyed globally. One advantage of our method is that the target stars can be selected non-randomly in real or apparent-magnitude space to ensure just such a global sample without biasing the results. Assuming we can always measure the line-of-sight velocity of a star with at least 1 km/s precision, we demonstrate that the force field can be determined to better than ~1% for Galactocentric radii in the range R=4-20 kpc We conclude that near-future surveys, like SIM Lite, Gaia, and VERA, will provide the first precise mapping of the gravitational force field in the region of the Galactic disk.
astro-ph.GA:We present Spitzer IRAC (~2 deg^2) and MIPS (~8 deg^2) observations of the Cepheus Flare which is associated with the Gould Belt, at an approximate distance of ~300 pc. Around 6500 sources are detected in all four IRAC bands, of which ~900 have MIPS 24 micron detections. We identify 133 YSO candidates using color-magnitude diagram techniques, a large number of the YSO candidates are associated with the NGC 7023 reflection nebula. Cross identifications were made with the Guide Star Catalog II and the IRAS Faint Source Catalog, and spectral energy distributions (SED) were constructed. SED modeling was conducted to estimate the degree of infrared excess. It was found that a large majority of disks were optically thick accreting disks, suggesting that there has been little disk evolution in these sources. Nearest-neighbor clustering analysis identified four small protostellar groups (L1228, L1228N, L1251A, and L1251B) with 5-15 members each and the larger NGC 7023 association with 32 YSO members. The star formation efficiency for cores with clusters of protostars and for those without clusters was found to be ~8% and ~1% respectively. The cores L1155, L1241, and L1247 are confirmed to be starless down to our luminosity limit of L_bol=0.06 L_sol.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the relationship between the star formation rate per unit area and the surface density of the ISM (the local Kennicutt-Schmitt law) using a simplified model of the ISM and a simple estimate of the star formation rate based on the mass of gas in bound clumps, the local dynamical timescales of the clumps, and an efficiency parameter of around 5 per cent. Despite the simplicity of the approach, we are able to reproduce the observed linear relation between star formation rate and surface density of dense (molecular) gas. We use a simple model for the dependence of H_2 fraction on total surface density to argue why neither total surface density nor the HI surface density are good local indicators of star formation rate. We also investigate the dependence of the star formation rate on the depth of the spiral potential. Our model indicates that the mean star formation rate does not depend significantly on the strength of the spiral potential, but that a stronger spiral potential, for a given mean surface density, does result in more of the star formation occurring close to the spiral arms. This agrees with the observation that grand design galaxies do not appear to show a larger degree of star formation compared to their flocculent counterparts.
astro-ph.GA:We have obtained the mass-metallicity (M-Z) relation at different lookback times for the same set of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, using the stellar metallicities estimated with our spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT. We have found that this relation steepens and spans a wider range in both mass and metallicity at higher redshifts. We have modeled the time evolution of stellar metallicity with a closed-box chemical evolution model, for galaxies of different types and masses. Our results suggest that the M-Z relation for galaxies with present-day stellar masses down to 10^10 M_sun is mainly driven by the history of star formation history and not by inflows or outflows.
astro-ph.GA:Classical and Type II Cepheids are used to reinvestigate specific properties of the Galaxy. A new Type II reddening-free Cepheid distance parameterization is formulated from LMC Cepheids (OGLE), with uncertainties typically no larger than 5-15%. A distance to the Galactic centre of R0=7.8+-0.6 kpc is derived from the median distance to Type II Cepheids in the bulge (OGLE), R0=7.7+-0.7 kpc from a distance to the near side of the bulge combined with an estimated bulge radius of 1.3+-0.3 kpc derived from planetary nebulae. The distance of the Sun from the Galactic plane inferred from classical Cepheid variables is Zsun=26+-3 pc, a result dependent on the sample's distance and direction because of the complicating effects of Gould's Belt and warping in the Galactic disk. Classical Cepheids and young open clusters delineate consistent and obvious spiral features, although their characteristics do not match conventional pictures of the Galaxy's spiral pattern. The Sagittarius-Carina arm is confirmed as a major spiral arm that appears to originate from a different Galactic region than suggested previously. Furthermore, a major feature is observed to emanate from Cygnus-Vulpecula and may continue locally near the Sun. Significant concerns related to the effects of metallicity on the VI-based reddening-free Cepheid distance relations used here are allayed by demonstrating that the computed distances to the Galactic centre, and to several globular clusters (M54, NGC 6441, M15, and M5) and galaxies (NGC 5128 and NGC 3198) which likely host Type II Cepheids: agree with literature results to within the uncertainties.
astro-ph.GA:We have analyzed HCN(1-0) and CS(2-1) line profiles obtained with high signal-to-noise ratios toward distinct positions in three selected objects in order to search for small-scale structure in molecular cloud cores associated with regions of high-mass star formation. In some cases, ripples were detected in the line profiles, which could be due to the presence of a large number of unresolved small clumps in the telescope beam. The number of clumps for regions with linear scales of ~0.2-0.5 pc is determined using an analytical model and detailed calculations for a clumpy cloud model; this number varies in the range: ~2 10^4-3 10^5, depending on the source. The clump densities range from ~3 10^5-10^6 cm^{-3}, and the sizes and volume filling factors of the clumps are ~(1-3) 10^{-3} pc and ~0.03-0.12. The clumps are surrounded by inter-clump gas with densities not lower than ~(2-7) 10^4 cm^{-3}. The internal thermal energy of the gas in the model clumps is much higher than their gravitational energy. Their mean lifetimes can depend on the inter-clump collisional rates, and vary in the range ~10^4-10^5 yr. These structures are probably connected with density fluctuations due to turbulence in high-mass star-forming regions.
astro-ph.GA:Observations of distinct positions in Orion and W3 revealed ripples on the HCN(1-0), HCO^+(1-0) and CO(1-0) line profiles which can be result of emission of large number of unresolved thermal clumps in the beam that move with random velocities. The total number of such clumps are ~(0.4-4) 10^5 for the areas with linear sizes ~0.1-0.5 pc.
astro-ph.GA:We present photometry for the globular cluster NGC 6642 using the F606W and F814W filters with the ACS/WFC third generation camera on board of Hubble Space Telescope. The Colour Magnitude Diagram shows sources reaching ~ 6 mags below the turn-off in m_F606W. A theoretical isochrone fitting was performed and evolutionary parameters were obtained, such as the metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.80 +/- 0.2 and age log(Age) = 10.14 +/- 0.05. We confirm that NGC 6642 is located in the Galactic bulge, with a distance to the Sun d_{\odot} = 8.05 +/- 0.66 ~ kpc$ and the reddening E(B-V) = 0.46 +/- 0.02. These values are in general agreement with those of previous authors. About 30 blue stragglers were found within the central 1.6 pc of NGC 6642. They are strongly concentrated to the very central regions. The cluster displays a well-developed horizontal branch, with a much redder morphology than that of typical old halo globular clusters of similar metallicity. Completeness corrected luminosity and mass functions were obtained for different annuli centred on NGC 6642. Their spatial variation indicates the existence of mass segregation and depletion of low mass stars. Most striking is the inverted shape of the mass function itself, with an increase in number as a function of increasing mass. This has been previously observed in other globular clusters and is also the result of N-body simulations of stellar systems which have undergone ~ 90% of their lifetime and which are subjected to strong tidal effects. We also analysed the density profile and concluded that NGC 6642 has a collapsed core, provided completeness effects are correctly accounted for. We thus conclude from independent means that NGC 6642 is a very old, highly-evolved, core-collapsed globular cluster with an atypical HB morphology.
astro-ph.GA:We use the distant outer halo globular cluster Palomar 14 as a test case for classical vs. modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Previous theoretical calculations have shown that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion predicted by these theories can differ by up to a factor of three for such sparse, remote clusters like Pal 14. We determine the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of Palomar 14 by measuring radial velocities of 17 red giant cluster members obtained using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Keck telescope. The systemic velocity of Palomar 14 is (72.28+-0.12)km/s. The derived velocity dispersion of (0.38+-0.12)km/s of the 16 definite member stars is in agreement with the theoretical prediction for the classical Newtonian case according to Baumgardt et al. (2005). In order to exclude the possibility that a peculiar mass function might have influenced our measurements, we derived the cluster's main sequence mass function down to 0.53Msolar using archival images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We found a mass function slope of 1.27+-0.44, which is, compared to the canonical mass function, a significantly shallower slope. The derived lower limit on the cluster's mass is higher than the theoretically predicted mass in case of MOND. Our data are consistent with a central density of 0.1 Msolar pc^-3. We need no dark matter in Palomar 14. If the cluster is on a circular orbit, our spectroscopic and photometric results argue against MOND, unless this cluster experienced significant mass loss.
astro-ph.GA:We present accurate new ultraviolet and optical BVI photometry for the Galactic globular cluster ngc2808, based on both ground-based and archival HST imagery. From this we have selected a sample of ~2,000 HB stars; given the extensive wavelength range considered and the combination of both high-angular-resolution and wide-field photometric coverage, our sample should be minimally biased. We divide the HB stars into three radial bins and find that the relative fractions of cool, hot and extreme HB stars do not change radically when moving from the center to the outskirts of the cluster: the difference is typically smaller than ~2sigma. These results argue against the presence of strong radial differentiation among any stellar subpopulations having distinctly different helium abundances. The ratio between HB and RG stars brighter than the ZAHB steadly increases when moving from the innermost to the outermost cluster regions. The difference is larger than ~4sigma and indicates a deficiency of bright RGs in the outskirts of the cluster.
astro-ph.GA:The observed dynamical mass-to-light (M/L) ratios of globular clusters (GCs) are systematically lower than those expected from `canonical' simple stellar population models, which do not account for the preferential loss of low-mass stars due to energy equipartition. It was recently shown that low-mass star depletion can qualitatively explain the M/L discrepancy. To verify whether it is indeed the driving mechanism, we derive dissolution timescales and use these to predict the M/L_V ratios of the 24 Galactic GCs for which orbital parameters and dynamical M/L_V are known. We also predict the slopes of their low-mass stellar mass functions (MFs). We use the SPACE cluster models, which include dynamical dissolution, low-mass star depletion, stellar evolution, stellar remnants and various metallicities. The predicted M/L_V are in 1 sigma agreement with the observations for 12 out of 24 GCs. The discrepancy for the other GCs probably arises because our predictions give global M/L ratios, while the observations represent extrapolated central values that are different from global ones in case of mass segregation and a long dissolution timescale. GCs in our sample which likely have dissimilar global and central M/L ratios can be excluded by imposing limits on the dissolution timescale and King parameter. For the remaining GCs, the observed and predicted average M/L_V are 78^+9_-11% and 78+/-2% of the canonically expected values, while for the entire sample the values are 74^+6_-7% and 85+/-1%. The predicted correlation between the slope of the low-mass stellar MF and M/L_V is qualitatively consistent with observed MF slopes. It is concluded that the variation of M/L ratio due to dissolution and low-mass star depletion is a plausible explanation for the discrepancy between the observed and canonically expected M/L ratios of GCs.

astro-ph.GA:It is generally agreed that interstellar dust grains consist of two main components, namely, silicates and graphites. Some models, like MRN model, assume these grains to be homogeneous spheres following a power law size distribution. This paper presents, in the framework of Mie theory, a parametrization of extinction spectrum curves of the silicates and the graphites separately in terms of frequency and the minimum and maximum of sizes in the distribution. Analytic expressions in ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet are presented for both types of grains.The values of maximum and minimum sizes for which these equations are valid have been identified. These equations can be useful in a number of situations involving silicate and graphite grains.
astro-ph.GA:Using the near-infrared spectral stellar library of Cenarro et al. (2001a,b), the behaviours of the Mg I line at 8807 angstrom and nearby TiO bands are analyzed in terms of the effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity of the library stars. New spectroscopic indices for both spectral features -namely MgI and sTiO- are defined, and their sensitivities to different signal-to-noise ratios, spectral resolutions, flux calibrations, and sky emission line residuals are characterized. The new two indices exhibit interesting properties. In particular, MgI reveals as a good indicator of the Mg abundance, whereas sTiO is a powerful dwarf-to-giant discriminator for cold spectral types. Empirical fitting polynomials that reproduce the strength of the new indices as a function of the stellar atmospheric parameters are computed, and a FORTRAN routine with the fitting functions predictions is made available. A thorough study of several error sources, non-solar [Mg/Fe] ratios, and their influence on the fitting function residuals is also presented. From this analysis, a [Mg/Fe] underabundance of ~ -0.04 is derived for the Galactic open cluster M67.
astro-ph.GA:This paper presents the analysis of candidate quiescent low mass xray binarie (qLMXBs) observed during a short Chandra/ACIS observation of the globular cluster (GC) NGC 6304. Two out of the three candidate qLMXBs of this cluster, XMMU 171433-292747 and XMMU 171421-292917, lie within the field of view. This permits comparison with the discovery observation of these sources. The one in the GC core -- XMMU 171433-292747 -- is spatially resolved into two separate X-ray sources, one of which is consistent with a pure H-atmosphere qLMXB, and the other is an X-ray power-law spectrum source. These two spectral components separately account for those observed from XMMU 171433-292747 in its discovery observation. We find that the observed flux and spectral parameters of the H-atmosphere spectral components are consistent with the previous observation, as expected from a qLMXB powered by deep crustal heating. XMMU 171421-292917 also has neutron star atmosphere spectral parameters consistent with those in the XMM-Newton observation and the observed flux has decreased by a factor 0.54^{+0.30}_{-0.24}.
astro-ph.GA:We present the largest, most homogeneous catalogue of merging galaxies in the nearby universe obtained through the Galaxy Zoo project - an interface on the world-wide web enabling large-scale morphological classification of galaxies through visual inspection of images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The method converts a set of visually-inspected classifications for each galaxy into a single parameter (the `weighted-merger-vote fraction,' $f_m$) which describes our confidence that the system is part of an ongoing merger. We describe how $f_m$ is used to create a catalogue of 3003 visually-selected pairs of merging galaxies from the SDSS in the redshift range $0.005 < z <0.1$. We use our merger sample and values of $f_m$ applied to the SDSS Main Galaxy Spectral sample (MGS) to estimate that the fraction of volume-limited ($M_r < -20.55$) major mergers ($1/3 < {M}^*_1/{M}^*_2 < 3$) in the nearby universe is $1 - 3 \times C%$ where $C \sim 1.5$ is a correction factor for spectroscopic incompleteness. Having visually classified the morphologies of the constituent galaxies in our mergers, we find that the spiral-to-elliptical ratio of galaxies in mergers is higher by a factor $\sim 2$ relative to the global population. In a companion paper, we examine the internal properties of these merging galaxies and conclude that this high spiral-to-elliptical ratio in mergers is due to a longer time-scale over which mergers with spirals are detectable compared to mergers with ellipticals.
astro-ph.GA:We have used archival 74 MHz VLA data spanning the last 15 years in combination with new data from the Long Wavelength Demonstrator Array (LWDA) and data from the literature covering the last 50 years to explore the evolution of Cas A at low radio frequencies. We find that the secular decrease of the flux density of Cas A at ~80 MHz is rather stable over five decades of time, decreasing at a rate of 0.7-0.8% yr^-1. This is entirely consistent with previous estimates at frequencies as low as 38 MHz, indicating that the secular decrease is roughly the same at low frequencies, at least between 38 and 80 MHz. We also find strong evidence for as many as four modes of flux density oscillation about the slower secular decrease with periods of 3.10+/-0.02$ yr, 5.1+/-0.3 yr, 9.0+/-0.2 yr, and 24+/-2 yr. These are also consistent with fluctuations seen previously to occur on scales of a few years. These results provide compelling motivation for a thorough low frequency monitoring campaign of Cas A to constrain the nature and physical origins of these fluctuations, and to be able to better predict the flux density of Cas A at any given epoch so that it may be used as a reliable low frequency calibrator.
astro-ph.GA:Following the study of Darg et al. (2009; hereafter D09a) we explore the environments, optical colours, stellar masses, star formation and AGN activity in a sample of 3003 pairs of merging galaxies drawn from the SDSS using visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project. While D09a found that the spiral-to-elliptical ratio in (major) mergers appeared higher than that of the global galaxy population, no significant differences are found between the environmental distributions of mergers and a randomly selected control sample. This makes the high occurrence of spirals in mergers unlikely to be an environmental effect and must, therefore, arise from differing time-scales of detectability for spirals and ellipticals. We find that merging galaxies have a wider spread in colour than the global galaxy population, with a significant blue tail resulting from intense star formation in spiral mergers. Galaxies classed as star-forming using their emission-line properties have average star-formation rates approximately doubled by the merger process though star formation is negligibly enhanced in merging elliptical galaxies. We conclude that the internal properties of galaxies significantly affect the time-scales over which merging systems can be detected (as suggested by recent theoretical studies) which leads to spirals being `over-observed' in mergers. We also suggest that the transition mass $3\times10^{10}{M}_{\astrosun}$, noted by \citet{kauffmann1}, below which ellipticals are rare could be linked to disc survival/destruction in mergers.
astro-ph.GA:We employ an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based technique to develop a pipeline for automated segregation of stars from the galaxies to be observed by Tel-Aviv University Ultra-Violet Experiment (TAUVEX). We use synthetic spectra of stars from UVBLUE library and selected International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) low resolution spectra for galaxies in the ultraviolet (UV) region from 1250 to 3220\AA as the training set and IUE low-resolution spectra for both the stars and the galaxies as the test set. All the data sets have been pre-processed to get band integrated fluxes so as to mimic the observations of the TAUVEX UV imager. We also perform the ANN based segregation scheme using the full length spectral features (which will also be useful for the ASTROSAT mission). Our results suggest that, in the case of the non-availability of full spectral features, the limited band integrated features can be used to segregate the two classes of objects; although the band data classification is less accurate than the full spectral data classification.
astro-ph.GA:Gamma Doradus stars are excellent targets for asteroseismology since the gravity modes present in these stars probe the deep stellar interiors. Mode identification will improve the knowledge of these stars considerably. A selected group of Gamma Doradus stars and some candidates were observed with the Mercator telescope to find and/or confirm the periodicities in the light variations and to derive reliable amplitude ratios in different pass bands. A frequency analysis was performed on all new data obtained in the Geneva photometric system. In order to have more reliable and accurate frequencies, the new data were combined with similar data from the literature and with Hipparcos observations. A set of frequencies that minimized the the residuals in a harmonic fit was searched for while allowing means and amplitudes to vary from one observation set to another. Frequencies and amplitudes in the photometric passbands of the Geneva system are given for 21 Gamma Doradus stars. We report the discovery of HD 74504 as a newly found Gamma Doradus star. Our study provides the first extensive multicolour database for the understanding of gravity modes in F-type stars.
astro-ph.GA:We have detected significant Rotation Measure variations for 9 bright pulsars, as a function of pulse longitude. An additional sample of 10 pulsars showed a rather constant RM with phase, yet a small degree of RM fluctuation is visible in at least 3 of those cases. In all cases, we have found that the rotation of the polarization position angle across our 1.4 GHz observing band is consistent with the wavelength-squared law of interstellar Faraday Rotation. We provide for the first time convincing evidence that RM variations across the pulse are largely due to interstellar scattering, although we cannot exclude that magnetospheric Faraday Rotation may still have a minor contribution; alternative explanations of this phenomenon, like erroneous de-dispersion and the presence of non-orthogonal polarization modes, are excluded. If the observed, phase-resolved RM variations are common amongst pulsars, then many of the previously measured pulsar RMs may be in error by as much as a few tens of rad m-2.
astro-ph.GA:We present GALEX near ultraviolet (NUV:1750 - 2750A) and far ultraviolet (FUV: 1350 - 1750A) imaging observations of two 1.2 degree diameter fields in the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters in order to detect possible UV variability of the member stars. We have performed a detailed software search for short-term UV flux variability during these observations of the approx 400 sources detected in each of the Hyades and Pleiades fields to identify flare-like (dMe) stellar objects. This search resulted in the detection of 16 UV variable sources, of which 13 can be directly associated with probable M-type stars. The other UV sources are G-type stars and one newly discovered RR Lyrae star, USNOB1.0 1069-0046050, of period 0.624 day and distance 4.5-7.0 kpc. Light curves of photon flux versus time are shown for 7 flare events recorded on six probable dMe stars. UV energies for these flares span the range 2E27 to 5E29 erg, with a corresponding NUV variability change of 1.82 mag. Only one of these flare events (on the star Cl* Melotte 25 LH129) can definitely be associated with an origin on a member the Hyades cluster itself. Finally, many of our M-type candidates show long periods of enhanced UV activity but without the associated rapid increase in flux that is normally associated with a flare event. However, the total UV energy output during such periods of increased activity is greater than that of many short-term UV flares. These intervals of enhanced low-level UV activity concur with the idea that, even in quiescence, the UV emission from dMe stars may be related to a superposition of many small flare events possessing a wide range of energies.
astro-ph.GA:Parallax is the most fundamental technique to measure distances to astronomical objects. Although terrestrial parallax was pioneered over 2000 years ago by Hipparchus (ca. 140 BCE) to measure the distance to the Moon, the baseline of the Earth is so small that terrestrial parallax can generally only be applied to objects in the Solar System. However, there exists a class of extreme gravitational microlensing events in which the effects of terrestrial parallax can be readily detected and so permit the measurement of the distance, mass, and transverse velocity of the lens. Here we report observations of the first such extreme microlensing event OGLE-2007-BLG-224, from which we infer that the lens is a brown dwarf of mass M=0.056 +- 0.004 Msun, with a distance of 525 +- 40 pc and a transverse velocity of 113 +- 21 km/s. The velocity places the lens in the thick disk, making this the lowest-mass thick-disk brown dwarf detected so far. Follow-up observations may allow one to observe the light from the brown dwarf itself, thus serving as an important constraint for evolutionary models of these objects and potentially opening a new window on sub-stellar objects. The low a priori probability of detecting a thick-disk brown dwarf in this event, when combined with additional evidence from other observations, suggests that old substellar objects may be more common than previously assumed.
astro-ph.GA:We present a 9 deg^2 map of the North American and Pelican Nebulae regions obtained in all four IRAC channels with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The resulting photometry is merged with that at JHKs from 2MASS and a more spatially limited $BVI$ survey from previous ground-based work. We use a mixture of color- color diagrams to select a minimally contaminated set of more than 1600 objects that we claim are young stellar objects (YSOs) associated with the star forming region. Because our selection technique uses IR excess as a requirement, our sample is strongly biased against inclusion of Class III YSOs. The distribution of IRAC spectral slopes for our YSOs indicates that most of these objects are Class II, with a peak towards steeper spectral slopes but a substantial contribution from a tail of flat spectrum and Class I type objects. By studying the small fraction of the sample that is optically visible, we infer a typical age of a few Myr for the low mass population. The young stars are clustered, with about a third of them located in eight clusters that are located within or near the LDN 935 dark cloud. Half of the YSOs are located in regions with surface densities higher than 1000 YSOs / deg^2. The Class I objects are more clustered than the Class II stars.
astro-ph.GA:We used the Extended Submillimeter Array (eSMA) in its most extended configuration to investigate the innermost (within a radius of 290 R* from the star) circumstellar envelope (CSE) of IRC+10216. We imaged the CSE using HCN and other molecular lines with a beam size of 0."22 x 0."46, deeply into the very inner edge (15 R*) of the envelope where the expansion velocity is only 3 km/s. The excitation mechanism of hot HCN and KCl maser lines is discussed. HCN maser components are spatially resolved for the first time on an astronomical object. We identified two discrete regions in the envelope: a region with a radius of . 15 R*, where molecular species have just formed and the gas has begun to be accelerated (region I) and a shell region (region II) with a radius of 23 R* and a thickness of 15 R*, whose expansion velocity has reached up to 13 km/s, nearly the terminal velocity of 15 km/s. The Si$^{34}$S line detected in region I shows a large expansion velocity of 16 km/s due to strong wing components, indicating that the emission may arise from a shock region in the innermost envelope. In region II, the P.A. of the most copious mass loss direction was found to be 120 +/- 10 degrees, which may correspond to the equatorial direction of the star. Region II contains a torus-like feature. These two regions may have emerged due to significant differences in the size distributions of the dust particles in the two regions.
astro-ph.GA:We have made CO(J=2-1) observations towards the HII region RCW 49 and its ionizing source, the rich stellar cluster Westerlund 2 (hereafter Wd2), with the NANTEN2 sub-mm telescope. These observations have revealed that two molecular clouds in velocity ranges of -11 to +9 km/s and 11 to 21 km/s respectively, show remarkably good spatial correlations with the Spitzer IRAC mid-infrared image of RCW 49, as well a velocity structures indicative of localized expansion around the bright central regions and stellar cluster. This strongly argues that the two clouds are physically associated with RCW 49. We obtain a new kinematic distance estimate to RCW 49 and Wd2 of 5.4^{+ 1.1}_{- 1.4} kpc, based on the mean velocity and velocity spread of the associated gas. We argue that acceleration of the gas by stellar winds from Wd2 is insufficient to explain the entire observed velocity dispersion of the molecular gas, and suggest a scenario in which a collision between the two clouds ~4 Myrs ago may have triggered the formation of the stellar cluster.
astro-ph.GA:We report on phase-referenced 23 GHz Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry (VLBI) observations of the type IIb supernova SN 2008ax, made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) on 2 April 2008 (33 days after explosion). These observations resulted in a marginal detection of the supernova. The total flux density recovered from our VLBI image is 0.8$\pm$0.3 mJy (one standard deviation). As it appears, the structure may be interpreted as either a core-jet or a double source. However, the supernova structure could be somewhat confused with a possible close by noise peak. In such a case, the recovered flux density would decrease to 0.48$\pm$0.12 mJy, compatible with the flux densities measured with the VLA at epochs close in time to our VLBI observations. The lowest average expansion velocities derived from our observations are $(1.90 \pm 0.30) \times 10^5$ km s$^{-1}$ (case of a double source) and $(5.2 \pm 1.3) \times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$ (taking the weaker source component as a spurious, close by, noise peak, which is the more likely interpretation). These velocities are 7.3 and 2 times higher, respectively, than the maximum ejecta velocity inferred from optical-line observations.
astro-ph.GA:Most stars do not form in isolation but as part of a cluster comprising anywhere between a few dozen to several million stars with stellar densities ranging from 0.01 to several 10$^5$ \Msun pc$^{-3}$. The majority of these clusters dissolve within 20 Myr. The general assumption is that clusters are born more or less over this entire density range. A new analysis of cluster observations is presented. It demonstrates that, in fact, clustered star formation works under surprisingly tight constraints with respect to cluster size and density. The observed multitude of cluster densities simply results from snapshots of two sequences evolving in time along pre-defined tracks in the density-radius plane. This implies that the cluster size can actually be used to determine its age.
astro-ph.GA:We present high resolution spectra of the five known hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) stars in the vicinity of the 10830 Angstrom line of neutral helium. In R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars the He I line is known to be strong and broad, often with a P Cygni profile, and must be formed in the powerful winds of those stars. RCB stars have similar chemical abundances as HdC stars and also share greatly enhanced 18O abundances with them, indicating a common origin for these two classes of stars, which has been suggested to be white dwarf mergers. A narrow He I absorption line may be present in the hotter HdC stars, but no line is seen in the cooler stars, and no evidence for a wind is found in any of them. The presence of wind lines in the RCB stars is strongly correlated with dust formation episodes so the absence of wind lines in the HdC stars, which do not make dust, is as expected.
astro-ph.GA:We present the first determination of the radial velocities and metallicities of 78 red giant stars in the isolated dwarf irregular galaxy WLM. Observations of the calcium II triplet in these stars were made with FORS2 at the VLT-UT2 in two separated fields of view in WLM, and the [Fe/H] values were conformed to the Carretta & Gratton (1997) metallicity scale. The mean metallicity is <[Fe/H]> = -1.27 +/- 0.04 dex, with a standard deviation of 0.37. We find that the stars in the inner field are more metal rich by [Fe/H] =0.30 +/- 0.06 dex. These results are in agreement with previous photometric studies that found a radial population gradient, as well as the expectation of higher metallicities in the central star forming regions. Age estimates using Victoria-Regina stellar models show that the youngest stars in the sample (< 6 Gyr) are more metal rich by [Fe/H] = 0.32 +/- 0.08 dex. These stars also show a lower velocity dispersion at all elliptical radii compared to the metal-poor stars. Kinematics for the whole red giant sample suggest a velocity gradient approximately half that of the gas rotation curve, with the stellar component occupying a thicker disk decoupled from the HI rotation plane. Taken together, the kinematics, metallicities, and ages in our sample suggest a young metal-rich, and kinematically cold stellar population in the central gas-rich regions of WLM, surrounded by a separate dynamically hot halo of older, metal poor stars.
astro-ph.GA:To search for Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) and to study star formation in tidal features, we are conducting a large UV imaging survey of interacting galaxies selected from the Arp (1996) Atlas using the GALEX telescope. As part of that study, we present a GALEX UV and SDSS and SARA optical study of the gas-rich interacting galaxy pair Arp 305 (NGC 4016/7). The GALEX UV data reveal much extended diffuse UV emission and star formation outside the disks. This includes a luminous star forming region between the two galaxies, and a number of such regions in tidal tails. We have identified 45 young star forming clumps in Arp 305, including several TDG candidates. By comparing the UV and optical colors to population synthesis models, we determined that the clumps are very young, with several having ages of about 6 Myr. We do not find many intermediate age clumps in spite of the fact that the last closest encounter was about 300 Myr ago. We have used a smooth particle hydrodynamics code to model the interaction and determine the fate of the star clusters and candidate TDGs.
astro-ph.GA:We present high angular resolution observations of water masers at 1.3 cm and radio continuum emission at 1.3, 3.6 and 6 cm towards the Bok globule CB 54 using the Very Large Array. At 1.3 cm, with subarsecond angular resolution, we detect a radio continuum compact source located to the south-west of the globule and spatially coincident with a mid-infrared embedded object (MIR-b). The spectral index derived between 6 and 1.3 cm (alpha=0.3+/-0.4) is flat, consistent with optically thin free-free emission from ionized gas. We propose the shock-ionization scenario as a viable mechanism to produce the radio continuum emission observed at cm frequencies. Water masers are detected at two different positions separated by 2.3'', and coincide spatially with two mid-infrared sources: MIR-b and MIR-c. The association of these mid-IR sources with water masers confirms that they are likely protostars undergoing mass-loss, and they are the best candidate as driving sources of the molecular outflows in the region.
astro-ph.GA:We have detected stellar halo streams in the solar neighborhood using data from the 7th public data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which includes the directed stellar program SEGUE: Sloan Extension For Galactic Understanding and Exploration. In order to derive distances to each star, we used the metallicity-dependent photometric parallax relation from Ivezic et al. (2008) for which we examine and quantify the accuracy. Our final sample consists of 22,321 nearby (d < 2 kpc), metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -0.5) main-sequence stars with 6D estimates of position and space velocity. We characterize the orbits of these stars through suitable kinematic proxies for their "effective" integrals of motion, angular momentum, eccentricity, and orbital polar angle and compare the observed distribution to expectations from a smooth distribution in four [Fe/H] bins. On this basis we identify at least five significant "phase-space overdensities" of stars on very similar orbits in the solar neighborhood to which we can assign unambiguously peaked [Fe/H] distributions. Three of them have been identified previously, including the halo stream discovered by Helmi et al. (1999) at a significance level of 12.0. In addition, we find at least two new genuine halo streams, judged by their kinematics and [Fe/H], at significance levels of 2.9 and 4.8, respectively. For one stream the stars even show coherence in configuration space, matching a spatial overdensity of stars found by Juric et al. (2008) at (R,z) \approx (9.5,0.8) kpc. Our results demonstrate the practical power of our search method to detect substructure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars without making a-priori assumptions about the detailed form of the gravitational potential.
astro-ph.GA:We define new potential-density pairs and examine the impact of the potential flattening on the vertical velocity ellipsoid tilt, $\delta$. By means of numerical integrations and analytical calculations, we estimate $\delta$ in a variety of galactic potentials. We show that at 1 kpc above the Galactic plane at the solar radius, $\delta$ can differ by 5 degrees, depending on whether the dark matter halo is flat or spherical. This result excludes the possibility of an extremely flattened Galactic dark halo.
astro-ph.GA:Molecular outflows provide an alternative method of identifying protostellar cores, complementary to recent mid-infrared studies. Continuing our studies of Perseus, we investigate whether all Spitzer-identified protostars, and particularly those with low luminosities, drive outflows, and if any new protostellar cores (perhaps harbouring low-mass sources) can be identified via their outflows alone. We have used the heterodyne array receiver HARP on JCMT to make deep 12CO 3-2 maps of submm cores in Perseus, extending and deepening our earlier study with RxB and bringing the total number of SCUBA cores studied up to 83. Our survey includes 23/25 of the Dunham et al. (2008) Spitzer low-luminosity objects believed to be embedded protostars, including three VeLLOs. All but one of the cores identified as harbouring embedded YSOs have outflows, confirming outflow detections as a good method for identifying protostars. We detect outflows from 20 Spitzer low-luminosity objects. We do not conclusively detect any outflows from IR-quiet cores, though confusion in clustered regions such as NGC1333 makes it impossible to identify all the individual driving sources. This similarity in detection rates despite the difference in search methods and detection limits suggests either that the sample of protostars in Perseus is now complete, or that the existence of an outflow contributes to the Spitzer detectability, perhaps through the contribution of shocked H2 emission in the IRAC bands. For five of the low-luminosity sources, there is no protostellar envelope detected at 350 microns and the Spitzer emission is entirely due to shocks. Additionally, we detect the outflow from IRAS 03282+3035 at 850 microns with SCUBA due to CO line contamination in the continuum passband.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the nature of 4 young and low-mass open clusters (OCs) located in the $2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ quadrants with near-IR 2MASS photometry (errors $<0.1$ mag). After field decontamination, the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) display similar morphologies: a poorly-populated main sequence (MS) and a dominant fraction of pre-MS (PMS) stars somewhat affected by differential reddening. Pismis 5, vdB 80 and BDSB 96 have MS ages within $5\pm4$ Myr, while the MS of NGC 1931 is $10\pm3$ Myr old. However, non-instantaneous star formation is implied by the wider ($\sim20$ Myr) PMS age spread. The cluster masses derived from MS + PMS stars are low, within $\sim60-180 \ms$, with mass functions (MFs) significantly flatter than Salpeter's initial mass function (IMF). Distances from the Sun are within $1.0-2.4$ kpc, and the visual absorptions are in the range $\aV=1.0-2.0$. From the stellar radial density profiles (RDPs), we find that they are small ($\rc\la0.48$ pc, $\rl\la5.8$ pc), especially Pismis 5 with $\rc\approx0.2$ pc and $\rl\approx1.8$ pc. Except for the irregular and cuspy inner regions of NGC 1931 and Pismis 5, the stellar RDPs follow a King-like profile. At $\sim10$ Myr, central cusps - which in old clusters appear to be related to advanced dynamical evolution - are probably associated with a star-formation and/or molecular cloud fragmentation effect. Despite the flat MFs, vdB 80 and BDSB 96 appear to be typical young, low-mass OCs. NGC 1931 and especially Pismis 5, with irregular RDPs, low cluster mass and flat MFs, do not appear to be in dynamical equilibrium. Both may be evolving into OB associations and/or doomed to dissolution in a few $10^7$ yr.
astro-ph.GA:We perform a stability test of triaxial models in MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) using N-body simulations. The triaxial models considered here have densities that vary with $r^{-1}$ in the center and $r^{-4}$ at large radii. The total mass of the model varies from $10^8\Msun$ to $10^{10}\Msun$, representing the mass scale of dwarfs to medium-mass elliptical galaxies, respectively, from deep MOND to quasi-Newtonian gravity. We build triaxial galaxy models using the Schwarzschild technique, and evolve the systems for 200 Keplerian dynamical times (at the typical length scale of 1.0 kpc). We find that the systems are virial overheating, and in quasi-equilibrium with the relaxation taking approximately 5 Keplerian dynamical times (1.0 kpc). For all systems, the change of the inertial (kinetic) energy is less than 10% (20%) after relaxation. However, the central profile of the model is flattened during the relaxation and the (overall) axis ratios change by roughly 10% within 200 Keplerian dynamical times (at 1.0kpc) in our simulations. We further find that the systems are stable once they reach the equilibrium state.
astro-ph.GA:We constructed a sample of 185 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) by cross-correlating the Shen et al.'s SDSS DR3 X-ray quasar sample with FIRST and GB6 radio catalogues. From the spectrum energy distribution (SED) constructed using multi-band (radio, UV, optical, Infrared and X-ray) data, we derived the synchrotron peak frequency and peak luminosity. The black hole mass and the broad line region (BLR) luminosity (then the bolometric luminosity) were obtained by measuring the line-width and strength of broad emission lines from SDSS spectra. We define a subsample of 118 FSRQs, of which the nonthermal jet emission is thought to be dominated over the thermal emission from accretion disk and host galaxy. For this subsample, we found 25 FSRQs having synchrotron peak frequency > 10^{15} Hz, which is higher than the typical value for FSRQs. While only a weak anti-correlation is found between the synchrotron peak frequency and peak luminosity, it becomes significant when combining with the Wu et al.'s sample of 170 BL Lac objects. At similar peak frequency, the peak luminosity of FSRQs with $\nupeak > 10^{15}$ Hz is systematically higher than that of BL Lac objects, with some FSRQs out of the range covered by BL Lac objects. Although high $\nupeak$ are found in some FSRQs, they do not reach the extreme value of BL Lacs. For the subsample of 118 FSRQs, we found significant correlations between the peak luminosity and black hole mass, the Eddington ratio, and the BLR luminosity, indicating that the jet physics may be tightly related with the accretion process.
astro-ph.GA:We show that the relation between the mass of supermassive black holes located in the center of the host galaxies and the kinetic energy of random motions of the corresponding bulges is a useful tool to study the evolution of galaxies. In the form log[M_BH] = b + m log[M_G sigma^2/c^2], the best-fitting results for a sample of 64 galaxies of various morphological types are the slope m=0.80 and the normalization b=4.53. We note that, in analogy with the H-R diagram for stars, each morphological type of galaxy generally occupies a different area in the M_BH - (M_G sigma^2)/c^2 plane. In particular, we find elliptical galaxies in the upper part of the line of best fit, the lenticular galaxies in the middle part, and the late-type galaxies in the lower part, the mass of the central black hole giving an estimate of the age, whereas the kinetic energy of the stellar bulges is directly connected with the temperature of each galactic system. Finally, the values of the linear correlation coefficient, the intrinsic scatter, and the chi^2 obtained by using the M_BH - M_G sigma^2 relation are better than the corresponding ones obtained from the M_BH - sigma or M_BH - M_G relation.
astro-ph.GA:We present high resolution (R=80,000) spectroscopy of [NeII] emission from two young stars, GM Aur and AA Tau, which have moderate to high inclinations. The emission from both sources appears centered near the stellar velocity and is broader than the [NeII] emission measured previously for the face-on disk system TW Hya. These properties are consistent with a disk origin for the [NeII] emission we detect, with disk rotation (rather than photoevaporation or turbulence in a hot disk atmosphere) playing the dominant role in the origin of the line width. In the non-face-on systems, the [NeII] emission is narrower than the CO fundamental emission from the same sources. If the widths of both diagnostics are dominated by Keplerian rotation, this suggests that the [NeII] emission arises from larger disk radii on average than does the CO emission. The equivalent width of the [NeII] emission we detect is less than that of the spectrally unresolved [NeII] feature in the Spitzer spectra of the same sources. Variability in the [NeII] emission or the mid-infrared continuum, a spatially extended [NeII] component, or a very (spectrally) broad [NeII] component might account for the difference in the equivalent widths.
astro-ph.GA:Spiral galaxies dominate the local galaxy population. Disks are known to be fragile with respect to collisions. Thus it is worthwhile to probe under which conditions a disk can possibly survive such interactions. We present a detailed morpho-kinematics study of a massive galaxy with two nuclei, J033210.76--274234.6, at z=0.4. The morphological analysis reveals that the object consists of two bulges and a massive disk, as well as a faint blue ring. Combining the kinematics with morphology we propose a near-center collision model to interpret the object. We find that the massive disk is likely to have survived the collision of galaxies with an initial mass ratio of ~4:1. The N-body/SPH simulations show that the collision possibly is a single-shot polar collision with a very small pericentric distance of ~1 kpc and that the remnant of the main galaxy will be dominated by a disk. The results support the disk survival hypothesis. The survival of the disk is related to the polar collision with an extremely small pericentric distance. With the help of N-body/SPH simulations we find the probability of disk survival is quite large regardless whether the two galaxies merge or not.
astro-ph.GA:We exploit the large number of archival HST images of 47 Tuc to examine its subgiant branch (SGB) and main sequence (MS) for signs of multiple populations. In the cluster core, we find that the cluster's SGB exhibits a clear spread in luminosity, with at least two distinct components: a brighter one with a spread that is real but not bimodal, and a second one about 0.05 mag fainter, containing about 10% of the stars. In a less crowded field 6 arcminutes from the center, we find that the MS is broadened much more than can be accounted for by photometric errors, and that this broadening increases at fainter magnitudes.
astro-ph.GA:As an extension of four point mass lenses at the vertices of a rhombus, we present five point mass lenses at the center and vertices of a diamond, which constitute, for a source behind the center, a soluble model giving expressions of all the image positions (with the maximum number of images as twenty for five lenses). For a source near the center, all the image positions are obtained in the linear approximation.
astro-ph.GA:The periodical component predicted by the theory of optic-metrical parametric resonance was recently found in the signal of Sep A radio source. If such observations performed independently give similar results, they would provide another evidence of the gravitational waves (GW) existence and the perspectives of the GW astronomy could be discussed.
astro-ph.GA:We search for very small-diameter galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) representing the earliest phases of PN evolution. A recently published IPHAS catalogue of Ha-emitting stars provides a useful base for this study as all sources present in this catalogue must be of small angular diameter.   The PN candidates are selected based on their location in two colour-colour diagrams: IPHAS (r' - Ha) vs. (r' - i'), and 2MASS (J - H) vs. (H - Ks). Spectroscopic follow-up has been carried out on a sample of candidates in order to confirm their nature.   We present a total of 83 PN candidates. We were able to obtain spectra or find the classification from the literature for 35 candidates. Five of these objects are likely to be new PNe, including one large bipolar PN discovered serendipitously near an emission-line star. PN distances deduced from extinction-distance relations based on IPHAS field-star photometry are presented for the first time. These yield distance estimates for our objects in the range from 2 kpc to 6 kpc. From the data to hand, we conclude that four of the discovered objects are very probably young PNe.
astro-ph.GA:Cosmic rays and magnetic fields can substantially impact the launching of large-scale galactic winds. Many researchers have investigated the role of cosmic rays; our group previously showed that a cosmic-ray and thermally-driven wind could explain soft X-ray emission towards the center of the Galaxy. In this paper, we calculate the synchrotron emission from our original wind model and compare it to observations; the synchrotron data shows that earlier assumptions about the launching conditions of the wind must be changed: we are required to improve that earlier model by restricting the launching region to the domain of the inner "Molecular Ring", and by decreasing the magnetic field strength from the previously assumed maximum strength. With these physically-motived modifications, we find that a wind model can fit both the radio synchrotron and the X-ray emission, although that model is required to have a higher gas pressure and density than the previous model in order to reproduce the observed X-ray emission measure within the smaller `footprint'. The drop in magnetic field also decreases the effect of cosmic-ray heating, requiring a higher temperature at the base of the wind than the previous model.
astro-ph.GA:Interstellar polarization at far-infrared through millimeter wavelengths (0.1 - 1 mm) is primarily due to thermal emission from dust grains aligned with magnetic fields. This mechanism has led to studies of magnetic fields in a variety of celestial sources, as well as the physical characteristics of the dust grains and their interaction with the field. Observations have covered a diverse array of sources, from entire galaxies to molecular clouds and proto-stellar disks. Maps have been generated on a wide range of angular scales, from surveys covering large fractions of the sky, down to those with arcsecond spatial resolution. Additionally, the increasing availability of observations at multiple wavelengths in this band allows empirical tests of models of grain alignment and cloud structure. I review some of the recent work in this field, emphasizing comparisons of observations on multiple spatial scales and at multiple wavelengths.
astro-ph.GA:We propose to the community a comprehensive UV/optical/NIR imaging survey of Galactic star formation regions to probe all aspects of the star formation process. The primary goal of such a study is to understand the evolution of circumstellar protoplanetary disks and other detailed aspects of star formation in a wide variety of different environments. This requires a comprehensive emission-line survey of nearby star-forming regions in the Milky Way, where a high spatial resolution telescope+camera will be capable of resolving circumstellar material and shock structures. In addition to resolving circumstellar disks themselves, such observations will study shocks in the jets and outflows from young stars, which are probes of accretion in the youngest protoplanetary disks still embedded in their surrounding molecular clouds. These data will allow the measurement of proper motions for a large sample of stars and jets/shocks in massive star-forming regions for the first time, opening a new window to study the dynamics of these environments. It will require better than 30 mas resolution and a stable PSF to conduct precision astrometry and photometry of stars and nebulae. Such data will allow production of precise color-color and color magnitude diagrams for millions of young stars to study their evolutionary states. One can also determine stellar rotation, multiplicity, and clustering statistics as functions of environment and location in the Galaxy. For the first time we can systematically map the detailed excitation structure of HII regions, stellar winds, supernova remnants, and supershells/superbubbles. This survey will provide the basic data required to understand star formation as a fundamental astrophysical process that controls the evolution of the baryonic contents of the Universe.
astro-ph.GA:The last two decades have seen remarkable progress in our long-standing goal of determining the abundance and diversity of worlds in the Galaxy. Understanding of this subject involves tracing the path of interstellar material from dense cloud cores, to young stellar objects, protoplanetary disks, and finally extrasolar planets. Here we discuss the critical information provided on these objects by point-source far-ultraviolet spectroscopy with a large aperture, high resolution spectrograph of a large sample of unique protostellar and protoplanetary objects that will leverage our existing knowledge to lay out a path to new and powerful insight into the formation process. We lay out a systematic case of coordinated observations that will yield new knowledge about the process of assembly for both protostellar and protoplanetary systems - that addresses specific uncertainties in our current knowledge and takes advantage of potential new technologies to acquire the data needed.
astro-ph.GA:We present 1" resolution CARMA observations of the 3mm continuum and 95 GHz methanol masers toward 14 candidate high mass protostellar objects (HMPOs). Dust continuum emission is detected toward seven HMPOs, and methanol masers toward 5 sources. The 3mm continuum sources have diameters < 2x10^4 AU, masses between 21 and 1200 M_sun, and volume densities > 10^8 cm^-3. Most of the 3mm continuum sources are spatially coincident with compact HII regions and/or water masers, and are presumed to be formation sites of massive stars. A strong correlation exists between the presence of 3mm continuum emission, 22 GHz water masers, and 95 GHz methanol masers. However, no 3mm continuum emission is detected toward ultracompact HII regions lacking maser emission. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that 22 GHz water masers and methanol masers are signposts of an early phase in the evolution of an HMPO before an expanding HII region destroys the accretion disk.
astro-ph.GA:In this paper we estimated the temperatures and brightnesses of the Monoceros radio loop at 1420, 820 and 408 MHz. Linear spectrum is estimated for mean temperatures versus frequency between 1420, 820 and 408 MHz. The spectral index of Monoceros loop is also obtained. The brightness temperatures and surface brightnesses of the loop are computed using data taken from radio-continuum surveys at the three frequencies. The spectral index of the loop is also obtained from $T-T$ plots between 1420 - 820, 1420 - 408 and 820 - 408 MHz. The obtained results confirm non-thermal origin of the Monoceros radio loop.
astro-ph.GA:An isolated HI cloud with peculiar properties has recently been discovered by Dedes, Dedes, & Kalberla (2008, A&A, 491, L45) with the 300-m Arecibo telescope, and subsequently imaged with the VLA. It has an angular size of ~6', and the HI emission has a narrow line profile of width ~ 3 km/s.   We explore the possibility that this cloud could be associated with a circumstellar envelope ejected by an evolved star.   Observations were made in the rotational lines of CO with the IRAM-30m telescope, on three positions in the cloud, and a total-power mapping in the HI line was obtained with the Nancay Radio Telescope.   CO was not detected and seems too underabundant in this cloud to be a classical late-type star circumstellar envelope. On the other hand, the HI emission is compatible with the detached-shell model that we developed for representing the external environments of AGB stars.   We propose that this cloud could be a fossil circumstellar shell left over from a system that is now in a post-planetary-nebula phase. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that it is a Galactic cloud or a member of the Local Group, although the narrow line profile would be atypical in both cases.
astro-ph.GA:In extragalactic jets, the apparent position of the bright/narrow end (the core) depends on the observing frequency, owing to synchrotron self-absorption and external absorption. The effect must be taken into account in order to achieve unbiased results from multi-frequency VLBI data on AGN jets. Multi-frequency core shift measurements supplemented by other data enable estimating the absolute geometry and a number of fundamental physical properties of the jets and their environment. We have previously measured the shift between 13 and 3.6 cm in a sample of 29 AGNs to range between 0 and 1.4 mas. In these proceedings, we present and discuss first results of our follow-up study using VLBA between 1.4 and 15.4 GHz.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) Gas and star velocity dispersions have been derived for four circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) and the nucleus of the spiral galaxy NGC2903 using high resolution spectroscopy in the blue and far red. Stellar velocity dispersions have been obtained from the CaII triplet (CaT) lines at 8494, 8542, 8662A, using cross-correlation techniques while gas velocity dispersions have been measured by Gaussian fits to the Hbeta line.   The CNSFRs, with sizes of about 100 to 150pc in diameter, show a complex structure at the Hubble Space Telescope resolution, with a good number of subclusters with linear diameters between 3 and 8pc. Their stellar velocity dispersions range from 39 to 67 km/s. These values, together with the sizes measured on archival HST images yield upper limits to the dynamical masses for the individual star clusters between 1.8 and 8.7 x 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ and upper limits to the masses for the whole CNSFR between 4.9 x 10$^6$ and 4.3 x 10$^7$ M$_\odot$. ...
astro-ph.GA:We present new results based on high-resolution observations of Sgr A West at the Galactic center with the VLA at 1.3 cm. We measured proper motions for 71 compact HII components. We also investigated radial velocities in the LSR velocity using the H92a line data. Combining proper motion and radial velocity measurements, we have determined the 3D velocity distribution in Sgr A West. We find that the three ionized streams (Northern Arm, Eastern Arm, and Western Arc) can be modeled with three bundles of Keplerian orbits around Sgr A*. We determined the five orbital parameters for each of them using LSQ fitting to the locii of the streams. Our results confirm earlier results on the streams in the Western Arc and the Northern Arm to be in Keplerian orbits, suggesting that the stream in the Eastern Arm is also consistent with an elliptical orbit. Both the Northern and Eastern Arm streams have high eccentricities, while the Western Arc stream is nearly circular. All three streams orbit around Sgr A* in a counterclockwise sense (viewed from the Earth). We also report an ionized nebula associated with IRS 8, including a bow shock in radio continuum emission which shows excellent agreement with near IR observations. From the H92a line data, we find evidence for interaction between the IRS 8 nebula and the Northern Arm stream. Other new morphological features revealed in our high-resolution image include: 1) a helical structure in the Northern Arm, suggesting that MHD plays an important role in the motion of the ionized gas, in addition to the dynamics determined by the central gravitational field and 2) a linear feature in the IRS 16 region, suggesting the compressed edge of the Northern Arm may result from the collective winds and radiation pressure from the high mass stars in the IRS16 cluster.
astro-ph.GA:We report subarcsecond images of the high-mass star forming region Onsala 1 (ON 1) made with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 0.85 mm and the Very Large Array at 1.3 cm and 3.6 cm. ON~1 is one of the smallest ultracompact HII regions in the Galaxy and exhibits various star formation signposts. With our VLA and SMA observations, two new cm-wave sources and five sub-mm dust sources, respectively, within a field of ~3" (corresponding to a linear scale of 0.05 pc) are identified, indicating the multiplicity at the center of the ON 1 region. The dust and gas masses of these sub-mm sources are in the range of 0.8 to 6.4 M_sun. Among the five sub-mm dust sources, SMA2, with a dust and gas mass of 2.6 M_sun, demonstrates several star formation signatures, and hence likely represents an intermediate-mass (or even high-mass) star forming core. Due to the low star formation efficiency of ~10%, we suggest that star formation in the ON 1 region will continue. For example, SMA4 and SMA5 are not associated with any star formation signatures and likely mark star formation cores at very early evolutionary stages.
astro-ph.GA:Many physical properties of this SNR such as spectrum and polarization can only be investigated by radio observations. The $\lambda$11 cm and $\lambda$6\ cm continuum and polarization observations of SNR G65.2+5.7 were made with the Effelsberg 100-m and the Urumqi 25-m telescopes, respectively, to investigate the integrated spectrum, the spectral index distribution, and the magnetic field properties. $\lambda$21 cm archival data from the Effelsberg 100-m telescope have been also used. The integrated flux densities of G65.2+5.7 at $\lambda 11$ cm and $\lambda 6$ cm are $21.9\pm3.1$ Jy and 16.8$\pm$1.8 Jy, respectively. The power-law spectrum ($S\sim\nu^{\alpha}$) is well fitted by $\alpha = -0.58\pm0.07$ from 83 MHz to 4.8 GHz. Spatial spectral variations are small. Along the northern shell strong depolarizion is observed at both wavelengths. The southern filamentary shell of SNR G65.2+5.7 is polarized up to 54% at $\lambda 6$ cm. There is significant depolarization at $\lambda 11$ cm and confusion with diffuse polarized Galactic emission. Using equipartition principle, we estimated the magnetic field strength for the southern filamentary shell about 20 $\mu$G (filling factor 1) to 50 $\mu$G (filling factor 0.1). A faint HI shell may be associated with the SNR. Despite its unusual strong X-ray and optical emission and its very low surface brightness, the radio properties of SNR G65.2+5.7 are found to be typical for evolved shell type SNRs. SNR G65.2+5.7 may be expanding in a preblown cavity as indicated by a deficit of HI gas and a possible HI-shell.
astro-ph.GA:Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are considered as a major constituent of interstellar dust. They have been proposed as the carriers of the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs) observed in emission in the mid-IR. They likely have a significant contribution to various features of the extinction curve such as the 220 nm bump,the far-UV rise and the diffuse interstellar bands. Emission bands are also expected in the far-IR, which are better fingerprints of molecular identity than the AIBs. They will be searched for with the Herschel Space Observatory. Rotational emission is also expected in the mm range for those molecules which carry significant dipole moments. Despite spectroscopic studies in the laboratory, no individual PAH species could be identified. This emphasises the need for an investigation on where interstellar PAHs come from and how they evolve due to environmental conditions: ionisation and dissociation upon UV irradiation, interactions with electrons, gas and dust. There is also evidence for PAH species to contribute to the depletion of heavy atoms from the gas phase, in particular Si and Fe. This paper illustrates how laboratory work can be inspired from observations. In particular there is a need for understanding the chemical properties of PAHs and PAH-related species, including very small grains, in physical conditions that mimic those found in interstellar space. This motivates a joint effort between astrophysicists, physicists and chemists. Such interdisciplinary studies are currently performed, taking advantage of the PIRENEA set-up, a cold ion trap dedicated to astrochemistry.
astro-ph.GA:- Context: We present the results of a near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic study of the star forming region G61.48+0.09. - Aims: The purpose of this study is to characterize the stellar content of the cluster and to determine its distance, extinction, age and mass. - Methods: The stellar population was studied by using color-magnitude diagrams to select twenty promising cluster members, for which follow up spectroscopy was done. The observed spectra allowed a spectral classification of the stars. - Results: Two stars have emission lines, twelve are G-type stars, and six are late-O or early-B stars. - Conclusions: The cluster's extinction varies from A_{K_S} = 0.9 to A_{K_S} = 2.6, (or A_{V}~8 to A_{V}~23). G61.48+0.09 is a star forming region located at 2.5+/-0.4 Kpc. The cluster is younger than 10 Myr and has a minimum stellar mass of 1500+/-500 Solar masses. However, the actual total mass of the cluster remains undetermined, as we cannot see its whole stellar content.
astro-ph.GA:The observed slope at the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) displays a remarkable universality in a wide variety of physical environments. We predict that competitive accretion, the ongoing accretion of gas from a common reservoir by a collection of protostellar cores, can provide a natural explanation for such a universal slope in star forming regions with metallicities roughly greater than 1e-5 the solar value. In our discussion, we point out that competitive accretion will occur whenever a gaseous region has multiple Jeans masses of material and contains large-scale motions that are controlled by the gravitational potential well. We describe how and when these conditions can be reached during the chemical enrichment of the Universe, showing that they can occur for a wide range of metallicities and environmental conditions. We also discuss the ability of other physical processes to limit the effects of further accretion onto protostellar cores. Current theoretical and numerical studies show that competitive accretion is robust against disrupting effects - such as feedback from young stars, supersonic turbulence and magnetic fields - in all but the most extreme cases.
astro-ph.GA:We present deep HI observations of the moderately inclined spiral galaxy, NGC 2997. The goal of these observations was to search for HI clouds in the vicinity of NGC 2997 analogous to the high velocity clouds of the Milky Way and gain insight into their origins. We find evidence for the presence of a galactic fountain as well as the accretion of intragalactic material, however we do not identify any large clouds of HI far from the disk of the galaxy. NGC 2997 has a thick, lagging HI disk that is modeled with a vertical velocity gradient of 18-31 km/s/kpc. Anomalous velocity HI clouds with masses of order 10^7 Msun, which cannot be explained by galactic fountain models allow us to estimate a lower limit to the accretion of extragalactic gas of 1.2 Msun/yr. The number and mass of these clouds have implications for cosmological simulations of large scale structure and the presence of dark matter halos. We have used values from the the literature to estimate a star formation rate of 5 +/- 1 Msun/yr and to derive a new distance to NGC 2997 of 12.2 +/- 0.9 Mpc using published Tully-Fisher relations.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the star-formation ocurring in the region towards IRAS07527-3446 in the molecular cloud [MAB97]250.63-3.63, in the far outer Galaxy. We report the discovery of a new young stellar cluster, and describe its properties and those of its parent molecular cloud. Near-infrared JHKS images were obtained with VLT/ISAAC, and millimetre line CO spectra were obtained with the SEST telescope. VLA archive date were also used. The cloud and cluster are located at a distance of 10.3 kpc and a Galactocentric distance of 15.4 kpc, in the far outer Galaxy. Morphologically, IRAS 07527-3446 appears as a young embedded cluster of a few hundred stars seen towards the position of the IRAS source, extending for about 2-4 pc and exhibiting sub-clustering. The cluster contains low and intermediate-mass young reddened stars, a large fraction having cleared the inner regions of their circumstellar discs responsible for (H-Ks) colour excess. The observations are compatible with a < 5 Myr cluster with variable spatial extinction of between Av = 5 and Av = 11. Decomposition of CO emission in clumps, reveals a clump clearly associated with the cluster position, of mass 3.3 x 10^3 M(solar). Estimates of the slopes of the Ks-band luminosity function and of the star-formation efficiency yield values similar to those seen in nearby star-formation sites. These findings reinforce previous results that the distant outer Galaxy continues to be active in the production of new and rich stellar clusters, with the physical conditions required for the formation of rich clusters continuing to be met in the very distant environment of the outer Galactic disc.
astro-ph.GA:A strong signature of a circumstellar disc around a high-mass protostar has been inferred from high resolution methanol maser observations in NGC7538-IRS1 N. This interpretation has however been challenged with a bipolar outflow proposed as an alternative explanation. We compare the two proposed scenarios for best consistency with the observations. Using a newly developed formalism we model the optical depth of the maser emission at each observed point in the map and LOS velocity for the two scenarios. We find that if the emission is symmetric around a central peak in both space and LOS velocity then it has to arise from an edge-on disc in sufficiently fast differential rotation. Disc models successfully fit ~100 independent measurement points in position-velocity space with 4 free parameters to an overall accuracy of 3-4%. Solutions for Keplerian rotation require a central mass of at least 4 solar masses. Close to best-fitting models are obtained if Keplerian motion is assumed around a central mass equaling ~30 solar masses as inferred from other observations. In contrast we find that classical bipolar outflow models cannot fit the data, although could be applicable in other sources. Our results strongly favour the differentially rotating disc hypothesis to describe the main feature of the 12.2 (and 6.7) GHz methanol maser emission in NGC7538 IRS1 N. Furthermore, for Keplerian rotation around a ~30 solar masses protostar we predict the position and velocity at which tangentially amplified masers should be detected in high dynamic range observations.

astro-ph.GA:We look for observational signatures that could discriminate between Newtonian and modified Newtonian (MOND) dynamics in the Milky Way, in view of the advent of large astrometric and spectroscopic surveys. Indeed, a typical signature of MOND is an apparent disk of "phantom" dark matter, which is uniquely correlated with the visible disk-density distribution. Due to this phantom dark disk, Newtonian models with a spherical halo have different signatures from MOND models close to the Galactic plane. The models can thus be differentiated by measuring dynamically (within Newtonian dynamics) the disk surface density at the solar radius, the radial mass gradient within the disk, or the velocity ellipsoid tilt angle above the Galactic plane. Using the most realistic possible baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we predict that, if MOND applies, the local surface density measured by a Newtonist will be approximately 78 Msun/pc2 within 1.1 kpc of the Galactic plane, the dynamically measured disk scale-length will be enhanced by a factor of 1.25 with respect to the visible disk scale-length, and the local vertical tilt of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpc above the plane will be approximately 6 degrees. None of these tests can be conclusive for the present-day accuracy of Milky Way data, but they will be of prime interest with the advent of large surveys such as GAIA.
astro-ph.GA:In this paper we use N-body simulations to study the effects of primordial mass segregation on the early and long-term evolution of star clusters. Our simulations show that in segregated clusters early mass loss due to stellar evolution triggers a stronger expansion than for unsegregated clusters. Tidally limited, strongly segregated clusters may dissolve rapidly as a consequence of this early expansion, while segregated clusters initially underfilling their Roche lobe can survive the early expansion and have a lifetime similar to that of unsegregated clusters. Long-lived initially segregated clusters tend to have looser structure and reach core collapse later in their evolution than initially unsegregated clusters. We have also compared the effects of dynamical evolution on the global stellar mass function (MF) of low-mass main sequence stars. In all cases the MF flattens as the cluster loses stars. The amount of MF flattening induced by a given amount of mass loss in a rapidly dissolving initially segregated cluster is less than for an unsegregated cluster. The evolution of the MF of a long-lived segregated cluster, on the other hand, is very similar to that of an initially unsegregated cluster.
astro-ph.GA:Observations indicate that the fraction of potential binary star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds is about 10%. In contrast, it is widely accepted that the binary cluster frequency in the Galaxy disk is much lower. Here we investigate the multiplicity of clusters in the Milky Way disk to either confirm or disprove this dearth of binaries. We quantify the open cluster multiplicity using complete, volume-limited samples from WEBDA and NCOVOCC. At the Solar Circle, at least 12% of all open clusters appear to be experiencing some type of interaction with another cluster; i.e., are possible binaries. As in the Magellanic Clouds, the pair separation histogram hints of a bimodal distribution. Nearly 40% of identified pairs are probably primordial. Most of the remaining pairs could be undergoing some type of close encounter, perhaps as a result of orbital resonances. Confirming early theoretical predictions, the characteristic time scale for destruction of bound pairs in the disk is 200 Myr or one galactic orbit. Our results show that the fraction of possible binary clusters in the Galactic disk is comparable to that in the Magellanic Clouds.
astro-ph.GA:We further develop the model of molecular cloud fragmentation introduced in Field, Blackman and Keto (2007; FBK). We show that external pressure acting on fragments establishes a scale-dependent critical mass. Fragments with masses less than the critical value are confined largely by pressure, while those with masses greater than or equal to the critical value collapse under self gravitation. Both types of fragments are commonly observed. Without specifying the source of the external pressure, and without assuming any other scaling relations, we predict the power - law index in the relation between the rms velocity of supersonic motions and the size of fragments . We then investigate the possibility that the external pressure is due to the kinetic energy of H atoms released by photodissociation of hydrogen molecules in the fragment. This can account approximately for the observed values of external pressure and two additional observations: the value of the scaling coefficient in the power law mentioned above, and the observation of outflowing atomic hydrogen around molecular clouds. A further prediction is HI at fragment edges with column densities of order 1E20 per sq. cm and velocities of a few km/s that should be detectable with high resolution 21 cm observations. Finally, we predict the magnitude of the coefficient of dissipation in the observed supersonic flows.
astro-ph.GA:We report high sensitivity sub-arcsecond angular resolution observations of the massive star forming region DR21(OH) at 3.6, 1.3, and 0.7 cm obtained with the Very Large Array. In addition, we conducted observations of CH3OH 44 GHz masers. We detected more than 30 new maser components in the DR21(OH) region. Most of the masers appear to trace a sequence of bow-shocks in a bipolar outflow. The cm continuum observations reveal a cluster of radio sources; the strongest emission is found toward the molecular core MM1. The radio sources in MM1 are located about 5" north of the symmetry center of the CH3OH outflow, and therefore, they are unlikely to be associated with the outflow. Instead, the driving source of the outflow is likely located in the MM2 core. Although based on circumstantial evidence, the radio continuum from MM1 appears to trace free-free emission from shock-ionized gas in a jet. The orientation of the putative jet in MM1 is approximately parallel to the CH3OH outflow and almost perpendicular to the large scale molecular filament that connects DR21 and DR21(OH). This suggests that the (accretion) disks associated with the outflows/jets in the DR21 - DR21(OH) region have symmetry axes mostly perpendicular to the filament.
astro-ph.GA:We for the first time propose a physical model of the precursor (PR) and interpulse (IP) components of the radio pulsar profiles. It is based on propagation effects in the secondary plasma flow of a pulsar. The components are suggested to result from the induced scattering of the main pulse (MP) into background. The induced scattering appears efficient enough to transfer a significant part of the MP energy to the background radiation. In the regimes of superstrong and moderately strong magnetic field, the scattered components are approximately parallel and antiparallel to the velocity of the scattering particles and can be identified with the PR and IP, respectively. The spectral evolution, polarization properties, and fluctuation behaviour of the scattered components are examined and compared with the observational results. The perspectives of the complex profile studies are outlined as well.
astro-ph.GA:We demonstrate a significant difference in the angular momentum transport properties of galactic disks between regions in which the interstellar medium is single phase or two phase. Our study is motivated by observations of HI in extended galactic disks which indicate velocity dispersions of nonthermal origin, suggesting that turbulence in the gas may be contributing significantly to the observed dispersion. To address this, we have implemented a shearing-box framework within the FLASH code. The new code was used to perform local simulations of galactic disks that incorporate differential rotation, self-gravity, vertical stratification, hydrodynamics and cooling. These simulations explore plausible mechanisms for driving turbulent motions via the thermal and self-gravitational instabilities coupling to differential rotation. Where a two-phase medium develops, gravitational angular momentum transporting stresses are much greater, creating a possible mechanism for transferring energy from galactic rotation to turbulence. In simulations where the disk conditions do not trigger the formation of a two-phase medium, it is found that perturbations to the flow damp without leading to a sustained mechanism for driving turbulence. The differing angular momentum transport properties of the single- and two-phase regimes of the disk suggest that a significant, dynamically motivated division can be drawn between the two, even when this division occurs far outside the star formation cutoff in a galactic disk.
astro-ph.GA:We report on the presence of 6.7-GHz methanol masers, known tracers of high-mass star formation, in the 3-kpc arms of the inner Galaxy. We present 49 detections from the Methanol Multibeam Survey, the largest Galactic plane survey for 6.7-GHz methanol masers, which coincide in longitude, latitude and velocity with the recently discovered far-side 3-kpc arm and the well known near-side 3-kpc arm. The presence of these masers is significant evidence for high-mass star formation actively occurring in both 3-kpc arms.
astro-ph.GA:Recent VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometer) observations determined the distances and proper motions of star-forming regions in spiral arms directly. They showed that star-forming regions and young stars have large peculiar motions, as large as 30 km/s with complex structures. Such a large peculiar motion is incompatible with the prediction of the standard theory of quasi-stationary spiral arms. We use a high-resolution, self-consistent N-body+hydrodynamical simulation to explore how the spiral arms are formed and maintained, and how star-forming regions move. We found that arms are not quasi-stationary but transient and recurrent, as suggested in alternative theories of spiral structures. Because of this transient nature of the spiral arms, star-forming regions exhibit a trend of large and complex non-circular motions, which is qualitatively consistent with the VLBI observations. Owing to this large non-circular motion, a kinematically estimated gas map of our Galaxy has a large systematic errors of ~2-3 kpc in the distance from the Sun.
astro-ph.GA:The correlation between stellar metallicity and the presence of giant planets is well established. It has been tentatively explained by the possible increase of planet formation probability in stellar disks with enhanced amount of metals. However, there are two caveats to this explanation. First, giant stars with planets do not show a metallicity distribution skewed towards metal-rich objects, as found for dwarfs. Second, the correlation with metallicity is not valid at intermediate metallicities, for which it can be shown that giant planets are preferentially found orbiting thick disk stars.   None of these two peculiarities is explained by the proposed scenarios of giant planet formation. We contend that they are galactic in nature, and probably not linked to the formation process of giant planets. It is suggested that the same dynamical effect, namely the migration of stars in the galactic disk, is at the origin of both features, with the important consequence that most metal-rich stars hosting giant planets originate from the inner disk, a property that has been largely neglected until now. We illustrate that a planet-metallicity correlation similar to the observed one is easily obtained if stars from the inner disk have a higher percentage of giant planets than stars born at the solar radius, with no specific dependence on metallicity. We propose that the density of molecular hydrogen in the inner galactic disk (the molecular ring) could play a role in setting the high percentage of giant planets that originate from this region.
astro-ph.GA:We explore the gravitational influence of pressure supported stellar systems on the internal density distribution of a gaseous environment. We conclude that compact massive star clusters with masses >= 10^6 M_sun act as cloud condensation nuclei and are able to accrete gas recurrently from a warm interstellar medium which may cause further star formation events and account for multiple stellar populations in the most massive globular and nuclear star clusters. The same analytical arguments can be used to decide whether an arbitrary spherical stellar system is able to keep warm or hot interstellar material or not. These mass thresholds coincide with transition masses between pressure supported galaxies of different morphological types.
astro-ph.GA:We argue that the origin of "FRI/FRI{-.1em}I dichotomy" -- the division between Fanaroff-Riley class I (FRI) with subsonic lobes and class I{-.1em}I (FRI{-.1em}I) radio sources with supersonic lobes is sharp in the radio-optical luminosity plane (Owen-White diagram) -- can be explained by the deceleration of advancing radio lobes. The deceleration is caused by the growth of the effective cross-sectional area of radio lobes. We derive the condition in which an initially supersonic lobe turns into a subsonic lobe, combining the ram-pressure equilibrium between the hot spots and the ambient medium with the relation between "the hot spot radius" and "the linear size of radio sources" obtained from the radio observations. We find that the dividing line between the supersonic lobes and subsonic ones is determined by the ratio of the jet power $L_{\rm j}$ to the number density of the ambient matter at the core radius of the host galaxy $\bar{n}_{\rm a}$. It is also found that there exists the maximal ratio of $(L_{\rm j}/\bar{n}_{\rm a})$ and its value resides in $(L_{\rm j}/\bar{n}_{\rm a})_{\rm max}\approx 10^{44-47} {\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1} {\rm cm}^{3}$, taking account of considerable uncertainties. This suggests that the maximal value $(L_{\rm j}/\bar{n}_{\rm a})_{\rm max}$ separates between FRIs and FRI{-.1em}Is.
astro-ph.GA:Deep JHK-Brg photometry of the southern arm of the grand-design spiral galaxy NGC 2997 was obtained by ISAAC/VLT. All sources in the field brighter than K=19 mag were located. Color-color diagrams were used to identify young stellar complexes among the extended sources. Ages can be estimated for the youngest complexes and correlated with azimuthal distances from the spiral arms defined by the K-band intensity variation. The extended sources with Mk <-12 mag display a diffuse appearance and are more concentrated inside the arm region than fainter ones, which are compact and uniformly distributed in the disk. The NIR colors of the bright diffuse objects are consistent with them being young starforming complexes with ages <10 Myr and reddened by up to 8 mag of visual extinction. They show a color gradient as a function of their azimuthal distance from the spiral arms. Interpreting this gradient as an age variation, the pattern speed Op = 16 km/s/kpc of the main spiral was derived assuming circular motion. The alignment and color gradient of the bright, diffuse complexes strongly support a density wave scenario for NGC 2997. Only the brightest complexes with Mk <-12 mag show a well aligned structure along the arm, suggesting that a strong compression in the gas due to the spiral potential is required to form these most massive aggregates, while smaller starforming regions are formed more randomly in the disk. The sharp transition between the two groups at Mk = -12 mag may be associated with expulsion of gas when the first supernovae explode in the complex.
astro-ph.GA:The rate of star formation both in the Galaxy and in external galaxies should be related to the physical properties of the molecular clouds from which stars form. This is expected for the starbursts found both in irregular galaxies and in some mergers. The dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10 is particularly interesting in this context as it shows a number of newly formed Super Star Clusters (SSCs) associated with a very rich molecular environment. We present a high angular resolution study of the molecular gas associated with the SSCs with the aim of deriving the physical properties of the parent molecular clouds. The final goal is to test the expectation that the formation of SSCs requires exceptionally dense and massive clouds. We have used the Submillimeter Array with an angular resolution of 1.9 X 1.3 to map the J=2-1 transition of CO in Henize 2-10. Supplementary measurements of HCN(J=1-0), 13CO(J=2-1) and millimeter continuum were obtained with the APEX, IRAM-30m and SEST single dish telescopes. Our single dish observations confirm the association of the newly formed SSCs in Henize 2-10 with dense molecular gas. Our interferometric observations resolve the CO(2-1) emission in several giant molecular clouds. Overall the molecular gas accounts for approximately half of the mass in the central regions of Henize 2-10. Although we find indications that the molecular clouds associated with the formation of SSCs in Henize 2-10 are massive and dense, the tracer we used (CO) and the linear resolution of our observations (60 X 80 pc) are still not adequate to test the expectation that exceptionally dense and massive cores are required for SSCs formation.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) Recently, the magnetic field induced Zeeman splitting was measured for the strongest known 6.7 GHz methanol maser, which arises in the massive star forming region G09.62+0.20. This maser is one of a handful of periodically flaring methanol masers. The 100-m Effelsberg telescope was used to monitor the 6.7 GHz methanol masers of G09.62+0.20. With the exception of a two week period during the peak of the maser flare, we measure a constant magnetic field of B_||~11+-2 mG in the two strongest maser components of G09.62+0.20 that are separated by over 200 AU. In the two week period that coincides exactly with the peak of the maser flare of the strongest maser feature, we measure a sharp decrease and possible reversal of the Zeeman splitting. The exact cause of both maser and polarization variability is still unclear, but it could be related to either background amplification of polarized emission or the presence of a massive protostar with a close-by companion. Alternatively, the polarization variability could be caused by non-Zeeman effects related to the radiative transfer of polarized maser emission.
astro-ph.GA:The image of planetary nebulae is made by three different physical processes. The first process is the expansion of the shell that can be modeled by the canonical laws of motion in the spherical case and by the momentum conservation when gradients of density are present in the interstellar medium. The second process is the diffusion of particles that radiate from the advancing layer. The 3D diffusion from a sphere as well as the 1D diffusion with drift are analyzed. The third process is the composition of the image through an integral operation along the line of sight. The developed framework is applied to A39, to the Ring nebula and to the etched hourglass nebula MyCn 18.
astro-ph.GA:M4 and NGC 6397 are two very similar galactic globular clusters, which differ mainly in their surface brightness profile. M4 has a classic King-like profile, whereas NGC 6397 has a more concentrated profile, which is often interpreted as that of a post-core collapse cluster. Heggie & Giersz (2008), however, found that M4 is also a post-core collapse cluster, and Giersz & Heggie (2009) concluded that the main reason for the difference between the two surface brightness profiles is fluctuations. This conclusion was reached on the basis of Monte Carlo models, however, and in the present Letter we verify that similar fluctuations occur in N-body models. The models were initialised by generating initial conditions from the Monte Carlo model of NGC 6397 at the simulated age of 12Gyr, and one was followed for 1Gyr. The new models help to clarify the nature of the fluctuations, which have the nature of semi-regular oscillations with a time scale of order 10^8yr. They are influenced by the dynamical role which is played by primordial binaries in the evolution of the core.
astro-ph.GA:We use N-body simulations to survey the response of embedded star clusters to the dispersal of their parent molecular cloud. The final stages of the clusters can be divided into three classes: the cluster (i) is destroyed, (ii) has a loose structure, and (iii) has a compact core. We are interested in three of the governing parameters of the parent cloud: (i) the mass, (ii) the size, and (iii) the dispersing rate. It is known that the final stage of the cluster is well correlated with the star formation efficiency (SFE) for systems with the same cluster and cloud profile. We deem that the SFE alone is not enough to address systems with clouds of different sizes. Our result shows that the initial cluster-cloud mass ratio at a certain Lagrangian radius, and the initial kinetic energy are better indicators for the survivability of embedded clusters.
astro-ph.GA:We combine new HST/ACS observations and existing data to investigate the wavelength dependence of NIR extinction. Previous studies suggest a power-law form, with a "universal" value of the exponent, although some recent observations indicate that significant sight line-to-sight line variability may exist. We show that a power-law model provides an excellent fit to most NIR extinction curves, but that the value of the power, beta, varies significantly from sight line-to-sight line. Therefore, it seems that a "universal NIR extinction law" is not possible. Instead, we find that as beta decreases, R(V) [=A(V)/E(B-V)] tends to increase, suggesting that NIR extinction curves which have been considered "peculiar" may, in fact, be typical for different R(V) values. We show that the power law parameters can depend on the wavelength interval used to derive them, with the beta increasing as longer wavelengths are included. This result implies that extrapolating power law fits to determine R(V) is unreliable. To avoid this problem, we adopt a different functional form for NIR extinction. This new form mimics a power law whose exponent increases with wavelength, has only 2 free parameters, can fit all of our curves over a longer wavelength baseline and to higher precision, and produces R(V) values which are consistent with independent estimates and commonly used methods for estimating R(V). Furthermore, unlike the power law model, it gives R(V)'s that are independent of the wavelength interval used to derive them. It also suggests that the relation R(V) = -1.36 E(K-V)/E(B-V) - 0.79 can estimate R(V) to +/-0.12. Finally, we use model extinction curves to show that our extinction curves are in accord with theoretical expectations.
astro-ph.GA:There exist many physical processes that may contribute to the driving of turbulence in galactic disks. Some of them could drive turbulence even in the absence of star formation. For example, hydrodynamic (HD) or magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, frequent mergers of small satellite clumps, ram pressure, or infalling gas clouds. In this work we present numerical simulations to study the interaction of compact high velocity clouds (CHVC) with the outskirts of magnetized gaseous disks. With our numerical simulations we show that the rain of small HVCs onto the disk is a potential source of random motions in the outer parts of HI disks.
astro-ph.GA:We presented CAIXA, a Catalogue of AGN in the XMM-Newton Archive, in a companion paper. Here, a systematic search for correlations between the X-ray spectral properties and the multiwavelength data was performed for the sources in CAIXA. All the significant (>99.9% confidence level) correlations are discussed along with their physical implications on current models of AGN. Two main correlations are discussed in this paper: a) a very strong anti-correlation between the FWHM of the H$\beta$ optical line and the ratio between the soft and the hard X-ray luminosity. Although similar anti-correlations between optical line width and X-ray spectral steepness have already been discussed in the literature (see e.g., Laor et al. 1994, Boller et al. 1996, Brandt et al. 1997), we consider the formulation we present in this paper is more fundamental, as it links model-independent quantities. Coupled with a strong anti-correlation between the V to hard X-ray flux ratio and the H$\beta$ FHWM, it supports scenarios for the origin of the soft excess in AGN, which require strong suppression of the hard X-ray emission; b) a strong (and expected) correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the black hole mass. Its slope, flatter than 1, is consistent with Eddington ratio-dependent bolometric corrections, such as that recently proposed by Vasudevan & Fabian (2009). Moreover, we critically review through various statistical tests the role that distance biases play in the strong radio to X-ray luminosity correlation found in CAIXA and elsewhere; we conclude that only complete, unbiased samples (such as that recently published by Behar & Laor, 2008) should be used to draw observational constraints on the origin of radio emission in radio-quiet AGN.
astro-ph.GA:Our aim is to show how different hypotheses about Type Ia supernova progenitors can affect Galactic chemical evolution. We include different Type Ia SN progenitor models, identified by their distribution of time delays, in a very detailed chemical evolution model for the Milky Way which follows the evolution of several chemical species. We test the single degenerate and the double degenerate models for supernova Ia progenitors, as well as other more empirical models based on differences in the time delay distributions. We find that assuming the single degenerate or the double degenerate scenario produces negligible differences in the predicted [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation. On the other hand, assuming a percentage of prompt (exploding in the first 100 Myr) Type Ia supernovae of 50%, or that the maximum Type Ia rate is reached after 3-4 Gyr from the beginning of star formation, as suggested by several authors, produces more noticeable effects on the [O/Fe] trend. However, given the spread still existing in the observational data no model can be firmly excluded on the basis of only the [O/Fe] ratios. On the other hand, when the predictions of the different models are compared with the G-dwarf metallicity distribution, the scenarios with very few prompt Type Ia supernovae can be excluded. Models including the single degenerate or double degenerate scenario with a percentage of 10-13% of prompt Type Ia supernovae produce results in very good agreement with the observations. A fraction of prompt Type Ia supernovae larger than 30% worsens the agreement with observations and the same occurs if no prompt Type Ia supernovae are allowed. In particular, two empirical models for the Type Ia SN progenitors can be excluded: the one without prompt Type Ia supernovae and the one assuming delay time distribution going like t^{-0.5}.
astro-ph.GA:Guided by the duality of turbulence (random versus coherent we seek coherent structures in the turbulent velocity field of molecular clouds, anticipating their importance in cloud evolution. We analyse a large map (40' by 20') obtained with the HERA multibeam receiver (IRAM-30m telescope) in a high latitude cloud of the Polaris Flare at an unprecedented spatial (11") and spectral (0.05 km/s) resolutions in the 12CO(2-1) line. We find that two parsec-scale components of velocities differing by ~2 km/s, share a narrow interface ($<0.15$ pc) that appears as an elongated structure of intense velocity-shear, ~15 to 30 km/s/pc. The locus of the extrema of line--centroid-velocity increments (E-CVI) in that field follows this intense-shear structure as well as that of the 12CO(2-1) high-velocity line wings. The tiny spatial overlap in projection of the two parsec-scale components implies that they are sheets of CO emission and that discontinuities in the gas properties (CO enrichment and/or increase of gas density) occur at the position of the intense velocity shear. These results disclose spatial and kinematic coherence between scales as small as 0.03 pc and parsec scales. They confirm that the departure from Gaussianity of the probability density functions of E-CVIs is a powerful statistical tracer of the intermittency of turbulence. They disclose a link between large scale turbulence, its intermittent dissipation rate and low-mass dense core formation.
astro-ph.GA:Recent observations and hydrodynamical simulations of star formation inside a giant molecular cloud have revealed that, within a star forming region, stars do not form evenly distributed throughout this region, but rather in small sub-clumps. It is generally believed that these sub-clumps merge and form a young star cluster. The time-scale of this merging process is crucial for the evolution and the possible survival of the final star cluster. The key issue is whether this merging process happens faster than the time needed to remove the residual gas of the cloud. A merging time-scale shorter than the gas-removal time would enhance the survival chances of the resulting star cluster. In this paper we show by means of numerical simulations that the time-scale of the merging is indeed very fast. Depending on the details of the initial sub-clump distribution, the merging may occur before the gas is expelled from the newly-formed cluster either via supernovae or the winds from massive stars. Our simulations further show that the resulting merger-objects have a higher effective star formation efficiency than the overall star forming region and confirm the results that mass-segregated sub-clumps form mass-segregated merger-objects.
astro-ph.GA:We review the evolution of the interstellar medium in disc galaxies, and show, both analytically and by numerical 3D hydrodynamic simulations, that the disc-halo connection is an essential ingredient in understanding the evolution of star forming galaxies. Depending on the star formation rate of the underlying gaseous disc, a galactic fountain is established. If the star formation rate is sufficiently high and/or cosmic rays are well coupled to the thermal plasma, a galactic wind will be formed and lead to a secular mass loss of the galaxy. Such a wind leaves a unique imprint on the soft X-ray spectra in edge-on galaxies, with delayed recombination being one of its distinctive features. We argue that synthetic spectra, obtained from self-consistent dynamical and thermal modelling of a galactic outflow, should be treated on an equal footing as observed spectra. We show that it is thus possible to successfully fit the spectrum of the starburst galaxy NGC 3079.
astro-ph.GA:The field just West of the galactic supernova remnant W28   (l=6.4\degr, b=-0.2\degr) harbors 3 of 5 newly-discovered 1720 OH maser spots and two recently-discovered candidate supernova candidates (one of which is a $\gamma$-ray source), as well as several compact and classical HII regions. Here, we analyze a datacube of CO J=1-0 emission having 1\arcmin and 1 \kms resolution, made with on-the-fly mapping over the region $5\degr \le l \le 6\degr, -1\degr \le b \le 0.5\degr$}. {Extended and often very bright CO emission was detected at the velocities of the 1720 MHz OH masers and around the supernova remnant G5.55+0.32 which lacks a maser. A new bipolar outflow which is marginally resolved at 1\arcmin resolution and strong in CO (12K) was detected at the periphery of G5.55+0.32, coincident with an MSX source; there is also a bright rim of CO just beyond the periphery of the radio remnant. The OH maser near G5.71-0.08 lies on a shell of strongly-emitting molecular gas (up to 20K) . At the -21 \kms velocity of G5.4-1.2, CO covers much of the field but is weak (3 K) and undisturbed near the remnant. The extended molecular gas around the compact H II region and outflow in G5.89-0.39 (W28A2) is shown for the first time.}
astro-ph.GA:We have carried out high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the carbon star V Hya, covering the 4.6 micron band of CO. These data, taken over 7 epochs, show that the circumstellar environment of V Hya consists of a complex high-velocity (HV) outflow containing at least six kinematic components with expansion velocities ranging between 70 and 120 km/s, together with a slow-moving normal outflow at about 10 km/s. Physical changes occur in the HV outflow regions on a time-scale as short as two days, limiting their extent to < ~ 10^{16} cm. The intrinsic line-width for each HV component is quite large (6-8 km/s) compared to the typical values (~1 km/s) appropriate for normal AGB circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), due to excess turbulence and/or large velocity gradients resulting from the energetic interaction of the HV outflow with the V Hya CSE. We have modelled the absorption features to set constraints on the temperature distribution in, and the mass ejection-rates for gas in the main HV components.
astro-ph.GA:We present Spitzer IRS and IRAC observations of the young supernova remnant E0102 (SNR 1E0102.2-7219) in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The infrared spectra show strong ejecta lines of Ne and O, with the [Ne II] line at 12.8 microns having a large velocity dispersion of 2,000-4,500 km/s indicative of fast-moving ejecta. Unlike the young Galactic SNR Cas A, E0102 lacks emission from Ar and Fe. Diagnostics of the observed [Ne III] line pairs imply that [Ne III] emitting ejecta have a low temperature of 650 K, while [Ne V] line pairs imply that the infrared [Ne V] emitting ejecta have a high density of ~10^4/cm3. We have calculated radiative shock models for various velocity ranges including the effects of photoionization. The shock model indicates that the [Ne V] lines come mainly from the cooling zone, which is hot and dense, whereas [Ne II] and [Ne III] come mainly from the photoinization zone, which has a low temperature of 400-1000 K. We estimate an infrared emitting Ne ejecta mass of 0.04 Msun from the infrared observations, and discuss implications for the progenitor mass. The spectra also have a dust continuum feature peaking at 18 microns that coincides spatially with the ejecta, providing evidence that dust formed in the expanding ejecta. The 18-micron-peak dust feature is fitted by a mixture of MgSiO3 and Si dust grains, while the rest of the continuum requires either carbon or Al2O3 grains. We measure the total dust mass formed within the ejecta of E0102 to be ~0.014 Msun. The dust mass in E0102 is thus a factor of a few smaller than that in Cas A. The composition of the dust is also different, showing relatively less silicate and likely no Fe-bearing dust, as is suggested by the absence of Fe-emitting ejecta.
astro-ph.GA:The chaos in stellar systems is studied using the theory of dynamical systems and the Van Kampen stochastic differential equation approach. The exponential instability (chaos) of spherical N-body gravitating systems, already known previously, is confirmed. The characteristic timescale of that instability is estimated confirming the collective relaxation time obtained by means of the Maupertuis principle.
astro-ph.GA:We have searched for massive molecular outflows in a sample of high-mass star forming regions, and we have characterised both the outflow properties and those of their associated molecular clumps. With a sample composed largely of more luminous objects than previous ones, this work complements analogous surveys performed by other authors by adding the missing highest luminosity sources. The sample under study has been selected so as to favour the earliest evolutionary phases of star formation, and is composed of very luminous objects (L_bol > 2x10^4 L_sun and up to ~10^6 L_sun), possibly containing O-type stars. Each source has been mapped in 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1) with the IRAM-30m telescope on Pico Veleta (Spain). The whole sample shows high-velocity wings in the 13CO(2-1) spectra, indicative of outflowing motions. In addition, we have obtained outflow maps in 9 of our 11 sources, which display well-defined blue and/or red lobes. For these sources, the outflow parameters have been derived from the line wing 13CO(2-1) emission. An estimate of the clump masses from the C18O(2-1) emission is also provided and found to be comparable to the virial masses. From a comparison between our results and those found by other authors at lower masses, it is clear that the outflow mechanical force increases with the bolometric luminosity of the clump and with the ionising photon rate of the associated HII regions, indicating that high-mass stars drive more powerful outflows. A tight correlation between outflow mass and clump mass is also found. Molecular outflows are found to be as common in massive star forming regions as in low-mass star forming regions. This, added to the detection of a few tentative large-scale rotating structures suggests that high-mass stars may generally form via accretion, as low-mass stars.
astro-ph.GA:We present observations in eight wavebands from 1.25-24 microns of four dense cores: L204C-2, L1152, L1155C-2, and L1228. Our goals are to study the YSO population of these cores and to measure the mid-infrared extinction law. With our combined near-infrared and Spitzer photometry, we classify each source in the cores as, among other things, background stars, galaxies, or embedded young stellar objects (YSOs). L1152 contains three YSOs and L1228 has seven, but neither L204C-2 nor L1155C-2 appear to contain any YSOs. We estimate an upper limit of 7x10^-5 to 5x10^-4 solar luminosities for any undiscovered YSOs in our cores. We also compute the line-of-sight extinction law towards each background star. These measurements are averaged spatially, to create chi-squared maps of the changes in the mid-infrared extinction law throughout our cores, and also in different ranges of extinction. From the chi-squared maps we identify two small regions in L1152 and L1228 where the outflows in those cores appear to be destroying the larger dust grains, thus altering the extinction law in those regions. On average, however, our extinction law is relatively flat from 3.6 to 24 microns for all ranges of extinction and in all four cores. From 3.6 to 8 microns this law is consistent with a dust model that includes larger dust grains than the diffuse interstellar medium, which suggests grain growth has occurred in our cores. At 24 microns, our extinction law is 2-4 times higher than predicted by dust models. However, it is similar to other empirical measurements.
astro-ph.GA:Kinematic distances to 750 molecular clouds identified in the 13CO J=1-0 Boston University-Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory Galactic Ring Survey (BU-FCRAO GRS) are derived assuming the Clemens rotation curve of the Galaxy. The kinematic distance ambiguity is resolved by examining the presence of HI self-absorption toward the 13CO emission peak of each cloud using the Very Large Array Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS). We also identify 21 cm continuum sources embedded in the GRS clouds in order to use absorption features in the HI 21 cm continuum to distinguish between near and far kinematic distances. The Galactic distribution of GRS clouds is consistent with a four-arm model of the Milky Way. The locations of the Scutum-Crux and Perseus arms traced by GRS clouds match star count data from the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) star-count data. We conclude that molecular clouds must form in spiral arms and be short-lived (lifetimes < 10 Myr) in order to explain the absence of massive, 13CO bright molecular clouds in the inter-arm space.
astro-ph.GA:We report here on the discovery of an extended far-infrared shell around the AGB star, R Cassiopeia, made by AKARI and Spitzer. The extended, cold circumstellar shell of R Cas spans nearly 3 arcmin and is probably shaped by interaction with the interstellar medium. This report is one of several studies of well-resolved mass loss histories of AGB stars under AKARI and Spitzer observing programs labeled "Excavating Mass Loss History in Extended Dust Shells of Evolved Stars (MLHES)".
astro-ph.GA:Recent far-infrared mapping of mass-losing stars by the AKARI Infrared Astronomy Satellite and Spitzer Space Telescope have suggested that far-infrared bow shock structures are probably ubiquitous around these mass-losing stars, especially when these stars have high proper motion. Higher spatial resolution data of such far-infrared bow shocks now allow detailed fitting to yield the orientation of the bow shock cone with respect to the heliocentric space motion vector of the central star, using the analytical solution for these bow shocks under the assumption of momentum conservation across a physically thin interface between the stellar winds and interstellar medium (ISM). This fitting analysis of the observed bow shock structure would enable determination of the ambient ISM flow vector, founding a new technique to probe the 3-D ISM dynamics that are local to these interacting systems. In this review, we will demonstrate this new technique for three particular cases, Betelgeuse, R Hydrae, and R Cassiopeiae.
astro-ph.GA:We have investigated the role of molecular anion chemistry in pseudo-time dependent chemical models of dark clouds. With oxygen-rich elemental abundances, the addition of anions results in a slight improvement in the overall agreement between model results and observations of molecular abundances in TMC-1 (CP). More importantly, with the inclusion of anions, we see an enhanced production efficiency of unsaturated carbon-chain neutral molecules, especially in the longer members of the families CnH, CnH2, and HCnN. The use of carbon-rich elemental abundances in models of TMC-1 (CP) with anion chemistry worsens the agreement with observations obtained in the absence of anions.
astro-ph.GA:Photoelectric UBV photometry and star counts are presented for the previously unstudied open cluster Collinder 236, supplemented by observations for stars near the Cepheid WZ Car. Collinder 236 is typical of groups associated with Cepheids, with an evolutionary age of (3.4+-1.1)x10^7 years, but it is 1944+-71 pc distant, only half the predicted distance to WZ Car. The cluster is reddened by E(B-V)~0.26, and has nuclear and coronal radii of rn~2 arcmin (1.1 pc) and Rc~8 arcmin (4.5 pc), respectively. The Cepheid is not a member of Collinder 236 on the basis of location beyond the cluster tidal radius and implied distance, but its space reddening can be established as E(B-V)=0.268+-0.006 s.e. from 5 adjacent stars. Period changes in WZ Car studied with the aid of archival data are revised. The period of WZ Car is increasing, its rate of +8.27+-0.19 s yr^(-1) being consistent with a third crossing of the instability strip.
astro-ph.GA:We present results of three-dimensional nonlinear MHD simulations of a large-scale magnetic field and its evolution inside a barred galaxy with the back reaction of the magnetic field on the gas. The model does not consider the dynamo process. To compare our modeling results with observations, we construct maps of the high-frequency (Faraday-rotation-free) polarized radio emission on the basis of simulated magnetic fields. The model accounts for the effects of projection and the limited resolution of real observations. We performed 3D MHD numerical simulations of barred galaxies and polarization maps. The main result is that the modeled magnetic field configurations resemble maps of the polarized intensity observed in barred galaxies. They exhibit polarization vectors along the bar and arms forming coherent structures similar to the observed ones. In the paper, we also explain the previously unsolved issue of discrepancy between the velocity and magnetic field configurations in this type of galaxies. The dynamical influence of the bar causes gas to form spiral waves that travel outwards. Each gaseous spiral arm is accompanied by a magnetic counterpart, which separates and survives in the inter-arm region. Because of a strong compression, shear of non-axisymmetric bar flows and differential rotation, the total energy of modeled magnetic field grows constantly, while the azimuthal flux grows slightly until $0.05\Gyr$ and then saturates.
astro-ph.GA:Star formation is mainly determined by the observation of H$\alpha$ radiation which is related to the presence of short lived massive stars. Disc galaxies show a strong cutoff in H$\alpha$ radiation at a certain galactocentric distance which has led to the conclusion that star formation is suppressed in the outer regions of disc galaxies. This is seemingly in contradiction to recent UV observations (Boissier et al., 2007) that imply disc galaxies to have star formation beyond the Halpha cutoff and that the star-formation-surface density is linearly related to the underlying gas surface density being shallower than derived from Halpha luminosities (Kennicutt, 1998). In a galaxy-wide formulation the clustered nature of star formation has recently led to the insight that the total galactic Halpha luminosity is non-linearly related to the galaxy-wide star formation rate (Pflamm-Altenburg et al., 2007d). Here we show that a local formulation of the concept of clustered star formation naturally leads to a steeper radial decrease of the Halpha surface luminosity than the star-formation-rate surface density in quantitative agreement with the observations, and that the observed Halpha cutoff arises naturally.
astro-ph.GA:We present a multiwavelength (ultraviolet, infrared, optical and CO) study of a set of luminous HII regions in M33: NGC 604, NGC 595, NGC 592, NGC 588 and IC131. We study the emission distribution in the interiors of the HII regions to investigate the relation between the dust emission at 8 micron and 24 micron and the location of the massive stars and gas. We find that the 24 micron emission is closely related to the location of the ionized gas, while the 8 micron emission is more related to the boundaries of the molecular clouds consistently with its expected association with photodissociation regions (PDRs). Ultraviolet emission is generally surrounded by the H-alpha emission. For NGC 604 and NGC 595, where CO data are available, we see a radial gradient of the emission distribution at the wavelengths studied here: from the center to the boundary of the HII regions we observe ultraviolet, H-alpha, 24 micron, 8 micron and CO emission distributions. We quantify the star formation for our HII regions using the integrated fluxes at the set of available wavelengths, assuming an instantaneous burst of star formation. We show that a linear combination of 24 micron and H-alpha emission better describes the star formation for these objects than the dust luminosities by themselves. For NGC 604, we obtain and compare extinction maps derived from the Balmer decrement and from the 24 micron and H-alpha emission line ratio. Although the maps show locally different values in extinction, we find similar integrated extinctions derived from the two methods. We also investigate here the possible existence of embedded star formation within NGC 604.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) Context: The Red MSX Source (RMS) survey is an ongoing multi-wavelength observational programme designed to return a large, well-selected sample of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). We have identified $\sim$2000 MYSO candidates located throughout the Galaxy by comparing the colours of MSX and 2MASS point sources to those of known MYSOs. Aims: To identify the populations of UCHII regions and PNe within the sample and examine their Galactic distribution. Method: We have conducted high resolution radio continuum observations at 6 cm towards 659 MYSO candidates in the northern hemisphere ($10\degr< l < 250\degr$) using the VLA. In addition to these targeted observations we present archival data towards a further 315 RMS sources extracted from a previous VLA survey of the inner Galaxy. Results: We find radio emission towards 272 ($\sim$27% of the observed sample). Using results from other parts of our multi-wavelength survey we separate these RMS-radio associations into two distinct types of objects, classifying 51 as PNe and a further 208 as either compact or UC HII regions. Using this well selected sample of HII regions we estimate their Galactic scale height to be 0.6\degr. Conclusions: Using radio continuum and archival data we have identified 79 PNe and 391 HII regions within the northern RMS catalogue. We estimate the total fraction of contamination by PNe in the RMS sample is of order 10%. The sample of HII regions is probably the best representation to date of the Galactic population of HII regions as a whole.
astro-ph.GA:We probe the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and radio synchrotron luminosity in galaxies at 0 < z < 2 within the northern Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic survey (SWIRE) fields, in order to investigate some of the assumptions that go into calculating the star formation history of the Universe from deep radio observations. We present new 610-MHz Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of the European Large-Area ISO Survey (ELAIS)-N2 field, and using this data, along with previous GMRT surveys carried out in the ELAIS-N1 and Lockman Hole regions, we construct a sample of galaxies which have redshift and SFR information available from the SWIRE survey. We test whether the local relationship between SFR and radio luminosity is applicable to z = 2 galaxies, and look for evolution in this relationship with both redshift and SFR in order to examine whether the physical processes which lead to synchrotron radiation have remained the same since the peak of star formation in the Universe. We find that the local calibration between radio luminosity and star formation can be successfully applied to radio-selected high-redshift, high-SFR galaxies, although we identify a small number of sources where this may not be the case; these sources show evidence for inaccurate estimations of their SFR, but there may also be some contribution from physical effects such as the recent onset of starburst activity, or suppression of the radio luminosity within these galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:To interpret the galactic center H II region complexes as constituents of a barred galaxy's nuclear star-forming ring, we compare 18cm VLA radiocontinuumm, $8-22\mu$ MSX IR and 2.6mm BTL and ARO12m CO emission in the inner few hundred pc. Galactic center H II regions are comparable in their IR appearance, luminosity and SED to M17 or N!0, but the IR light distribution is strongly modified by extinction at 8-22$\mu$, locally and overall. In Sgr B2 at $l > 0.6$\degr strong radio H II regions are invisible in the IR. In two favorable cases, extinction from individual galactic center molecular clouds is shown to have $\tau \ga 1$ at 8-22$\mu$ independent of wavelength. The gas kinematics are mostly rotational but with systematic $\pm 30-50$ \kms non-circular motion. Sgr B and C both show the same shell and high-velocity cap structure. The H II regions lie in a slightly-inclined ring of radius $\approx$ 180 pc (1.2\degr) whose near side appears at higher latitude and lower velocity and contains Sgr B. Sgr C is on the far side and both Sgr B and C represent collisions with material inflowing along the galactic dust lanes. Sgr E is a coincidental aggregation of field objects seen tangent to the ring's outer edge. Most of the volume interior to the ring is probably devoid of dense gas and some emission seen at v=20-70 \kms toward Sgr A lies outside it, in the ring.
astro-ph.GA:We have measured the HI power spectrum of the nearly face-on spiral galaxy NGC 1058 from radio-interferometric observations using a visibility based estimator. The power spectrum is well fitted by two different power laws $P(U)=AU^{\alpha}$, one with $\alpha =- 2.5\pm 0.6$ at small length-scales $(600 {\rm pc} {\rm to} 1.5 {\rm kpc})$ and another with $\alpha =- 1.0\pm 0.2$ at large length-scales $(1.5 {\rm kpc} {\rm to} 10.0   {\rm kpc})$. We interpret this change in the slope of the power spectrum as a transition from 3D turbulence at small length-scales to 2D turbulence in the plane of the galaxy's disk at large length-scales. We use the observed break in the power spectrum to estimate the galaxy's scale-height, which we find to be $ 490 \pm 90 $ pc.
astro-ph.GA:We present arcsecond resolution mid-infrared and millimeter observations of the center of the young stellar cluster AFGL961 in the Rosette molecular cloud. Within 0.2 pc of each other, we find an early B star embedded in a dense core, a neighboring star of similar luminosity with no millimeter counterpart, a protostar that has cleared out a cavity in the circumcluster envelope, and two massive, dense cores with no infrared counterparts. An outflow emanates from one of these cores, indicating a deeply embedded protostar, but the other is starless, bound, and appears to be collapsing. The diversity of states implies either that protostellar evolution is faster in clusters than in isolation or that clusters form via quasi-static rather than dynamic collapse. The existence of a pre-stellar core at the cluster center shows that that some star formation continues after and in close proximity to massive, ionizing stars.
astro-ph.GA:HH 211 is a nearby young protostellar system with a highly collimated jet. We have mapped it in 352 GHz continuum, SiO (J=8-7), and HCO+ (J=4-3) emission at up to ~ 0.2" resolution with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The continuum source is now resolved into two sources, SMM1 and SMM2, with a separation of ~ 84 AU. SMM1 is seen at the center of the jet, probably tracing a (inner) dusty disk around the protostar driving the jet. SMM2 is seen to the southwest of SMM1 and may trace an envelope-disk around a small binary companion. A flattened envelope-disk is seen in HCO+ around SMM1 with a radius of ~ 80 AU perpendicular to the jet axis. Its velocity structure is consistent with a rotation motion and can be fitted with a Keplerian law that yields a mass of ~ 50+-15 Jupiter mass (a mass of a brown dwarf) for the protostar. Thus, the protostar could be the lowest mass source known to have a collimated jet and a rotating flattened envelope-disk. A small-scale (~ 200 AU) low-speed (~ 2 km/s) outflow is seen in HCOP+ around the jet axis extending from the envelope-disk. It seems to rotate in the same direction as the envelope-disk and may carry away part of the angular momentum from the envelope-disk. The jet is seen in SiO close to ~ 100 AU from SMM1. It is seen with a "C-shaped" bending. It has a transverse width of <~ 40 AU and a velocity of ~ 170+-60 km/s. A possible velocity gradient is seen consistently across its innermost pair of knots, with ~ 0.5 km/s at ~ 10 AU, consistent with the sense of rotation of the envelope-disk. If this gradient is an upper limit of the true rotational gradient of the jet, then the jet carries away a very small amount of angular momentum of ~ 5 AU km/s and thus must be launched from the very inner edge of the disk near the corotation radius.
astro-ph.GA:We estimate the power spectrum of HI intensity fluctuations for a sample of 8 galaxies (7 dwarf and one spiral). The power spectrum can be fitted to a power law P_HI(U) = A U^\alpha for 6 of these galaxies, indicating turbulence is operational. The estimated best fit value for the slope ranges from ~ -1.5 (AND IV, NGC 628, UGC 4459 and GR 8) to ~ -2.6 (DDO 210 and NGC 3741). We interpret this bi-modality as being due to having effectively 2D turbulence on length scales much larger than the scale height of the galaxy disk and 3D otherwise. This allows us to use the estimated slope to set bounds on the scale heights of the face-on galaxies in our sample. We also find that the power law slope remains constant as we increase the channel thickness for all these galaxies, suggesting that the fluctuations in HI intensity are due to density fluctuations and not velocity fluctuations, or that the slope of the velocity structure function is ~ 0. Finally, for the four galaxies with "2D turbulence" we find that the slope \alpha correlates with the star formation rate per unit area, with larger star formation rates leading to steeper power laws. Given our small sample size this result needs to be confirmed with a larger sample.
astro-ph.GA:Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely accepted as the carriers of the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), but an unambiguous identification of any specific interstellar PAH is still missing. For polar PAHs, pure rotational transitions can be used as fingerprints for identification. Combining dedicated experiments, detailed simulations and observations, we explored the mm domain to search for specific rotational transitions of corannulene (C20H10). We performed high-resolution spectroscopic measurements and a simulation of the emission spectrum of UV-excited C20H10 in the environment of the Red Rectangle, calculating its synthetic rotational spectrum. Based on these results, we conducted a first observational campaign at the IRAM 30m telescope towards this source to search for several high-J rotational transitions of (C20H10). The laboratory detection of the J = 112 <- 111 transition of corannulene showed that no centrifugal splitting is present up to this line. Observations with the IRAM 30m telescope towards the Red Rectangle do not show any corannulene emission at any of the observed frequencies, down to a rms noise level of Tmb = 8 mK for the J =135 -> 134 transition at 137.615 GHz. Comparing the noise level with the synthetic spectrum, we are able to estimate an upper limit to the fraction of carbon locked in corannulene of about 1.0x10(-5) relative to the total abundance of carbon in PAHs. The sensitivity achieved shows that radio spectroscopy can be a powerful tool to search for polar PAHs. We compare this upper limit with models for the PAH size distribution, emphasising that small PAHs are much less abundant than predicted. We show that this cannot be explained by destruction but is more likely related to the chemistry of their formation in the environment of the Red Rectangle.
astro-ph.GA:Hierarchical star formation leads to a progressive decrease in the clustering of star clusters both in terms of spatial scale and age. Consistently, the statistical analysis of positions and ages of clusters in the Milky Way disk strongly suggests that a correlation between the duration of star formation in a region and its size does exist. The average age difference between pairs of open clusters increases with their separation as the ~0.16 power. In contrast and for the Large Magellanic Cloud, Efremov & Elmegreen (1998) found that the age difference scales with the ~0.35 power of the region size. This discrepancy may be tentatively interpreted as an argument in support of intrinsically shorter (faster) star formation time-scales in smaller galaxies. However, if both the effects of cluster dissolution and incompleteness are taken into consideration, the average age difference between cluster pairs in the Galaxy increases with their separation as the ~0.4 power. This result implies that the characteristic time-scale for coherent, clustered-mode star formation is nearly 1 Myr. Therefore, the overall consequence of ignoring the effect of cluster dissolution is to overestimate the star formation time-scale. On the other hand, in the Galactic disk and for young clusters separated by less than three times the characteristic cluster tidal radius (10 pc), the average age difference is 16 Myr, which suggests common origin.

astro-ph.GA:We re-examine the well-known discrepancy between ionic abundances determined via the analysis of recombination lines (RLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs). We show that abundance variations can be mimicked in a {\it chemically homogeneous} medium by the presence of dense X-ray irradiated regions which present different ionisation and temperature structures from those of the more diffuse medium they are embedded in, which is predominantly ionised by extreme-ultraviolet radiation. The presence of X-ray ionised dense clumps or filaments also naturally explains the lower temperatures often measured from O {\sc ii} recombination lines and from the Balmer jump when compared to temperatures determined by CELs. We discuss the implications for abundances determined via the analysis of CELs and RLs and provide a simple analytical procedure to obtain upwards corrections for CEL-determined abundance. While we show that the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) and the Balmer Jump temperature determined from observations of the Orion Nebula can simultaneously be reproduced by this model (implying upward corrections for CELs by a factor of 1.15), we find that the required X-ray fluxes exceed the known Orion's stellar and diffuse X-ray budget, if we assume that the clumps are located at the edge of the blister. We propose, however, that spatially resolved observations may be used to empirically test the model, and we outline how the framework developed in this letter may be applied in the future to objects with better constrained geometries (e.g. planetary nebulae).
astro-ph.GA:The discovery of new Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in our Galaxy via large-scale narrowband optical surveys has been severely limited by dust extinction. Recent improvements in infrared technology have made narrowband-broadband imaging surveys viable again. We report a new J, K and narrow-band imaging survey of 300 square degrees of the plane of the Galaxy, spanning 150 degrees in Galactic longitude and reaching 1 degree above and below the Galactic plane. The survey has a useful limiting magnitude of K = 15 over most of the observed Galactic plane, and K = 14 within a few degrees of the Galactic center. Thousands of emission line candidates have been detected. In spectrographic follow-ups of 173 WR star candidates we have discovered 41 new WR stars, 15 of type WN and 26 of type WC. Star subtype assignments have been confirmed with K band spectra, and distances approximated using the method of spectroscopic parallax. A few of the new WR stars are amongst the most distant known in our Galaxy. The distribution of these new WR stars is seen to follow that of previously known WR stars along the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Tentative radial velocities were also measured for most of the new WR stars.
astro-ph.GA:Intermediate and high velocity HI clouds rain onto the plane of our Galaxy. They are observed at heights of between 500 and 1500 pc, falling onto the Galactic plane at velocities from 50 to 140 km s$^{-1}$. To explain the origin of these clouds, we present a galactic fountain model, driven by the wind from a super stellar cluster (SSC). We solve the equations for a steady, radiative de Laval nozzle flow. We consider two effects not considered previously in astrophysical nozzle flow models: cooling functions for different metallicities, and the direct action of the galactic gravitational field on the gas flowing along the nozzle. For an adiabatic nozzle flow, the gravity acting directly on the gas within the nozzle "stalls" the nozzle flow for initial wind velocities lower than the escape velocity from the Galaxy. For the same wind velocity, a radiative nozzle flow stalls at lower altitudes above the galactic plane. We find that SSC winds with velocities of $v_w=500 - 800$ km s$^{-1}$ produce nozzles stall at heights of $x_m=1 - 15$ kpc. The stalled nozzle flow then rains back onto the galactic plane at velocities in the range observed in intermediate and high velocity HI clouds. We study a nozzle flow driven by a wind from a SSC close to the Galactic centre. We find that for velocities within the range expected for a SSC wind, we can produce nozzle flows that stall above the galactic plane. These stalled flows produce cool, infalling clouds with velocities similar to those of intermediate and high velocity HI clouds.
astro-ph.GA:We examine the dynamical destruction of binary systems in star clusters of different densities. We find that at high densities (10^4 - 10^5 Msun pc^-3) almost all binaries with separations > 10^3 AU are destroyed after a few crossing times. At low densities (order(10^2) Msun pc^-3) many binaries with separations > 10^3 AU are destroyed, and no binaries with separations > 10^4 AU survive after a few crossing times. Therefore the binary separations in clusters can be used as a tracer of the dynamical age and past density of a cluster.   We argue that the central region of the Orion Nebula Cluster was around 100 times denser in the past with a half-mass radius of only 0.1 - 0.2 pc as (a) it is expanding, (b) it has very few binaries with separations > 10^3 AU, and (c) it is well-mixed and therefore dynamically old.   We also examine the origin of the field binary population. Binaries with separations < 10^2 AU are not significantly modified in any cluster, therefore at these separations the field reflects the sum of all star formation. Binaries with separations in the range 10^2 - 10^4 AU are progressively more and more heavily affected by dynamical disruption in increasingly dense clusters. If most star formation is clustered, these binaries must be over-produced relative to the field. Finally, no binary with a separation > 10^4 AU can survive in any cluster and so must be produced by isolated star formation, but only if all isolated star formation produces extremely wide binaries.
astro-ph.GA:The central kpc of the Milky Way might be expected to differ significantly from the rest of the Galaxy with regard to gas dynamics and the formation of YSOs. We probe this possibility with mid-infrared observations obtained with IRAC and MIPS on Spitzer and with MSX. We use color-color diagrams and SED fits to explore the nature of YSO candidates (including objects with 4.5 micron excesses possibly due to molecular emission). There is an asymmetry in the distribution of the candidate YSOs, which tend to be found at negative Galactic longitudes; this behavior contrasts with that of the molecular gas, approximately 2/3 of which is at positive longitudes. The small scale height of these objects suggests that they are within the Galactic center region and are dynamically young. They lie between two layers of infrared dark clouds and may have originated from these clouds. We identify new sites for this recent star formation. The methanol masers appear to be associated with young, embedded YSOs characterized by 4.5 micron excesses. We use the SEDs of these sources to estimate their physical characteristics. Within the central 400x50 pc (|l|<1.3\degr and |b|<10') the star formation rate based on the identification of Stage I evolutionary phase of YSO candidates is about 0.14 solar mass/yr. We suggest that a recent burst of star formation took place within the last 10^5 years. This suggestion is also consistent with estimates of star formation rates within the last ~10^7 years showing a peak around 10^5 years ago. Lastly, we find that the Schmidt-Kennicutt Law applies well in the central 400 pc of the Galaxy. This implies that star formation does not appear to be dramatically affected by the extreme physical conditions in the Galactic center region.
astro-ph.GA:The degree to which interstellar grains align with respect to the interstellar magnetic field depends on disaligning as well as aligning mechanisms. For decades, it was assumed that disalignment was due primarily to the random angular impulses a grain receives when colliding with gas-phase atoms. Recently, a new disalignment mechanism has been considered, which may be very potent for a grain that has a time-varying electric dipole moment and drifts across the magnetic field. We provide quantitative estimates of the disalignment times for silicate grains with size > approximately 0.1 micron. These appear to be shorter than the time-scale for alignment by radiative torques, unless the grains contain superparamagnetic inclusions.
astro-ph.GA:We introduce a method to quantify the quality-of-fit between data and observables depending on the large scale Galactic magnetic field. We combine WMAP5 polarized synchrotron data and Rotation Measures of extragalactic sources in a joint analysis to obtain best fit parameters and confidence levels for GMF models common in the literature. None of the existing models provide a good fit in both the disk and halo regions, and in many instances best-fit parameters are quite different than the original values. We note that probing a very large parameter space is necessary to avoid false likelihood maxima. The thermal and relativistic electron densities are critical for determining the GMF from the observables but they are not well constrained. We show that some characteristics of the electron densities can already be constrained using our method and with future data it may be possible to carry out a self-consistent analysis in which models of the GMF and electron densities are simultaneously optimized.
astro-ph.GA:The Weibel instability is investigated with PIC simulations of an initially unmagnetized and spatially uniform electron plasma. This instability, which is driven by the thermally anisotropic electron distribution, generates electromagnetic waves with wave vectors perpendicular to the direction of the higher temperature. Two simulations are performed: A 2D simulation, with a simulation plane that includes the direction of higher temperature, demonstrates that the wave spectrum is initially confined to one dimension. The electric field components in the simulation plane generated by the instability equalize at the end of the simulation through a secondary instability. A 1D PIC simulation with a high resolution, where the simulation box is aligned with the wave vectors of the growing waves, reveals details of the electron phase space distribution and permits a comparison of the magnetic and electric fields when the instability saturates. It is shown that the electrostatic field is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient and that it and the magnetic field redistribute the electrons in space.
astro-ph.GA:We report new results from our effort to identify obscured Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy. Candidates were selected by their near-infrared (2MASS) and mid-infrared (Spitzer/GLIMPSE) color excesses, which are consistent with free-free emission from ionized stellar winds and thermal excess from hot dust. We have confirmed 12 new Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galactic disk, including 9 of the nitrogen subtype (WN), and 3 of the carbon subtype (WC); this raises the total number of Wolf-Rayet stars discovered with our approach to 27. We classify one of the new stars as a possible dust-producing WC9d+OBI colliding-wind binary, as evidenced by an infrared excess resembling that of known WC9d stars, the detection of OBI features superimposed on the WC9 spectrum, and hard X-ray emission detected by XMM-Newton. A WC8 star in our sample appears to be a member of the stellar cluster Danks 1, in contrast to the rest of the confirmed Wolf-Rayet stars that generally do not appear to reside within dense stellar clusters. Either the majority of the stars are runaways from clusters, or they formed in relative isolation. We briefly discuss prospects for the expansion and improvement of the search for Wolf-Rayet stars throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:We use proper motions and parallaxes from the new reduction of Hipparcos data and Geneva-Copenhagen radial velocities for a complete sample of ~15000 main-sequence and subgiant stars, and new Padova isochrones to constrain the kinematics and star-formation history of the solar neighbourhood. We rederive the solar motion and the structure of the local velocity ellipsoids. When the principal velocity dispersions are assumed to increase with time as t^\beta, the index \beta is larger for \sigma_W (\beta_W~0.45) than for \sigma_U (\beta_U~0.31). For the three-dimensional velocity dispersion we obtain \beta=0.35. We exclude saturation of disc heating after ~3 Gyr as proposed by Quillen & Garnett(2000). Saturation after >~4 Gyr combined with an abrupt increase in velocity dispersion for the oldest stars cannot be excluded. For all our models the star-formation rate is declining, being a factor 2-7 lower now than it was at the beginning. Models in which the SFR declines exponentially favour very high disc ages between 11.5 and 13 Gyr and exclude ages below ~10.5 Gyr as they yield worse fits to the number density and velocity dispersion of red stars. Models in which the SFR is the sum of two declining exponentials representing the thin and thick discs favour ages between 10.5 and 12 Gyr with a lower limit of ~10.0 Gyr. Although in our models the star-formation rate peaked surprisingly early, the mean formation time of solar-neighbourhood stars is later than in ab-initio models of galaxy formation, probably on account of weaknesses in such models.
astro-ph.GA:The relationship between the black hole mass and velocity dispersion indicated with [O III] line width is investigated for a sample of 87 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) selected from SDSS DR3 quasar catalogue. We found the M_bh - sigma_[O III] relation is deviated from Tremaine et al. relation for nearby inactive galaxies, with a larger black hole mass at given velocity dispersion. There is no strong evidence of cosmology evolution in M_bh - sigma_[O III] relation up to z~0.8. A significant correlation between the [O III] luminosity and Broad Line Region (BLR) luminosity is found. When transferring the [O III] luminosity to Narrow Line Region (NLR) luminosity, the BLR luminosity is, on average, larger than NLR one by about one order of magnitude. We found a strong correlation between the synchrotron peak luminosity and NLR luminosity, which implies a tight relation between the jet physics and accretion process.
astro-ph.GA:Whether or not supernovae contribute significantly to the overall dust budget is a controversial subject. Submillimetre (submm) observations, sensitive to cold dust, have shown an excess at 450 and 850 microns in young remnants Cassiopeia A (Cas A) and Kepler. Some of the submm emission from Cas A has been shown to be contaminated by unrelated material along the line of sight. In this paper we explore the emission from material towards Kepler using submm continuum imaging and spectroscopic observations of atomic and molecular gas, via HI, 12CO (J=2-1) and 13CO (J=2-1). We detect weak CO emission (peak TA* = 0.2-1K, 1-2km/s fwhm) from diffuse, optically thin gas at the locations of some of the submm clumps. The contribution to the submm emission from foreground molecular and atomic clouds is negligible. The revised dust mass for Kepler's remnant is 0.1--1.2 solar masses, about half of the quoted values in the original study by Morgan et al. (2003), but still sufficient to explain the origin of dust at high redshifts.
astro-ph.GA:We used magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of interstellar turbulence to study the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of increments of density, velocity, and magnetic field. We found that the PDFs are well described by a Tsallis distribution, following the same general trends found in solar wind and Electron MHD studies. We found that the PDFs of density are very different in subsonic and supersonic turbulence. In order to extend this work to ISM observations we studied maps of column density obtained from 3D MHD simulations. From the column density maps we found the parameters that fit to Tsallis distributions and demonstrated that these parameters vary with the sonic and Alfv\'en Mach numbers of turbulence. This opens avenues for using Tsallis distributions to study the dynamical and perhaps magnetic states of interstellar gas.
astro-ph.GA:We have performed monitoring observations of the 3-mm flux density toward the Galactic Center compact radio source Sgr A* with the Australia Telescope Compact Array since 2005 October. Careful calibrations of both elevation-dependent and time-dependent gains have enabled us to establish the variability behavior of Sgr A*. Sgr A* appeared to undergo a high and stable state in 2006 June session, and a low and variable state in 2006 August session. We report the results, with emphasis on two detected intra-day variation events during its low states. One is on 2006 August 12 when Sgr A* exhibited a 33% fractional variation in about 2.5 hr. The other is on 2006 August 13 when two peaks separated by about 4 hr, with a maximum variation of 21% within 2 hr, were seen. The observed short timescale variations are discussed in light of two possible scenarios, i.e., the expanding plasmon model and the sub-Keplerian orbiting hot spot model. The fitting results indicate that for the adiabatically expanding plasmon model, the synchrotron cooling can not be ignored, and a minimum mass-loss rate of 9.7*10^{-10}M_sun /yr is obtained based on parameters derived for this modified expanding plasmon model. Simultaneous multi-wavelength observation is crucial to our understanding the physical origin of rapid radio variability in Sgr A*.
astro-ph.GA:We present first preliminary results from AKARI/FIS pointed observations of post-AGB stars and planetary nebulae (PNe). A first analysis of the radial (azimuthally averaged) profile of the observed sources shows no evidence for excess emission due to the presence of circumstellar dust. No (detached) circumstellar faint dust-shells are seen in the image maps. Also, we present here first results of aperture flux photometry at wavelengths of 65, 90, 140 and 160 micron. Results are compared with IRAS flux densities as well as the beta release of the FIS Bright Source Catalog. Finally, spectral energy distributions are given, by way of an example, for two individual targets in our sample.
astro-ph.GA:We present the results of our preliminary study of all known Galactic PNe (included in the Kerber 2003 catalog) which are detected by the AKARI/FIS All-Sky Survey as identified in the AKARI/FIS Bright Source Catalog (BSC) Version Beta-1.
astro-ph.GA:Stable, accurate, divergence-free simulation of magnetized supersonic turbulence is a severe test of numerical MHD schemes and has been surprisingly difficult to achieve due to the range of flow conditions present. Here we present a new, higher order-accurate, low dissipation numerical method which requires no additional dissipation or local "fixes" for stable execution. We describe PPML, a local stencil variant of the popular PPM algorithm for solving the equations of compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics. The principal difference between PPML and PPM is that cell interface states are evolved rather that reconstructed at every timestep, resulting in a compact stencil. Interface states are evolved using Riemann invariants containing all transverse derivative information. The conservation laws are updated in an unsplit fashion, making the scheme fully multidimensional. Divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field is maintained using the higher order-accurate constrained transport technique of Gardiner and Stone. The accuracy and stability of the scheme is documented against a bank of standard test problems drawn from the literature. The method is applied to numerical simulation of supersonic MHD turbulence, which is important for many problems in astrophysics, including star formation in dark molecular clouds. PPML accurately reproduces in three-dimensions a transition to turbulence in highly compressible isothermal gas in a molecular cloud model. The low dissipation and wide spectral bandwidth of this method make it an ideal candidate for direct turbulence simulations.
astro-ph.GA:We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the velocity distribution of nearby stars (<~ 100 pc) using a maximum likelihood density estimation technique applied to the two-dimensional tangential velocities of stars. The underlying distribution is modeled as a mixture of Gaussian components. The algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved distribution function, even when the individual stars have unique error and missing-data properties. We apply this technique to the tangential velocity measurements from a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865 main sequence stars observed by the Hipparcos satellite. We explore various methods for validating the complexity of the resulting velocity distribution function, including criteria based on Bayesian model selection and how accurately our reconstruction predicts the radial velocities of a sample of stars from the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS). Using this very conservative external validation test based on the GCS, we find that there is little evidence for structure in the distribution function beyond the moving groups established prior to the Hipparcos mission. This is in sharp contrast with internal tests performed here and in previous analyses, which point consistently to maximal structure in the velocity distribution. We quantify the information content of the radial velocity measurements and find that the mean amount of new information gained from a radial velocity measurement of a single star is significant. This argues for complementary radial velocity surveys to upcoming astrometric surveys.
astro-ph.GA:Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are small (less than 1 kpc) radio sources which have symmetric double lobes or jets. The dominant theory for the small size of these objects is that they are young radio sources which could grow into larger radio galaxies, but the currently small population of known CSOs makes it difficult to definitively determine whether or not this is the case. While a greater number of Gigahertz peaked sources can be identified by sifting through spectral surveys, this yields none of the dynamics of the sources, and also brings Quasars into the sample, which although interesting are peaked around 1 Gigahertz for very different reasons. We have used the 5 GHz VLBA Imaging and Polarization Survey (VIPS) to identify 103 CSO candidates morphologically, and are following up on these sources with multifrequency VLBA observations to confirm CSO identifications and to study their dynamics. The identification of candidates from within the survey will be discussed, as well as preliminary results from the follow-up observations.
astro-ph.GA:We present homogeneous $V,I$ CCD photometry of nine stellar fields in the two inner quadrants of the Galactic plane. The lines-of-view to most of these fields aim in the direction of the very inner Galaxy, where the Galactic field is very dense, and extinction is high and patchy. Our nine fields are, according to several catalogs, centred on Galactic star clusters, namely Trumpler 13, Trumpler 20, Lynga 4, Hogg 19, Lynga 12, Trumpler 25, Trumpler 26, Ruprecht 128, and Trumpler 34. Apart from their coordinates, and in some cases additional basic data (mainly from the 2MASS archive), their properties are poorly known. By means of star count techniques and field star decontaminated Color-Magnitude diagrams, the nature and size of these visual over-densities has been established; and, when possible, new cluster fundamental parameters have been derived. To strengthen our findings, we complement our data-set with JHK$_{s}$ photometry from the 2MASS archive, that we analyze using a suitably defined Q-parameter. Most clusters are projected towards the Carina-Sagittarium spiral arm. Because of that, we detect in the Color Magnitude Diagrams of most of the other fields several distinctive sequences produced by young population within the arm. All the clusters are of intermediate or old age. The most interesting cases detected by our study are, perhaps, that of Trumpler 20, which seems to be much older than previously believed, as indicated by its prominent -and double- red clump; and that of Hogg 19, a previously overlooked old open cluster, whose existence in such regions of the Milky Way is puzzling.
astro-ph.GA:A study of gas-phase element abundances reported in the literature for 17 different elements sampled over 243 sight lines in the local part of our Galaxy reveals that the depletions into solid form (dust grains) are extremely well characterized by trends that employ only three kinds of parameters. One is an index that describes the overall level of depletion applicable to the gas in any particular sight line, and the other two represent linear coefficients that describe how to derive each element's depletion from this sight-line parameter. The information from this study reveals the relative proportions of different elements that are incorporated into dust at different stages of grain growth. An extremely simple scheme is proposed for deriving the dust contents and metallicities of absorption-line systems that are seen in the spectra of distant quasars or the optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Contrary to presently accepted thinking, the elements sulfur and krypton appear to show measurable changes in their depletions as the general levels of depletions of other elements increase, although more data are needed to ascertain whether or not these findings truly compelling. Nitrogen appears to show no such increase. The incorporation of oxygen into solid form in the densest gas regions far exceeds the amounts that can take the form of silicates or metallic oxides; this conclusion is based on differential measurements of depletion and thus is unaffected by uncertainties in the solar abundance reference scale.
astro-ph.GA:PSR B1259-63 is a 48 ms radio pulsar in a highly eccentric 3.4 year orbit with a Be star SS 2883. Unpulsed gamma-ray, X-ray and radio emission components are observed from the binary system. It is likely that the collision of the pulsar wind with the anisotropic wind of the Be star plays a crucial role in the generation of the observed non-thermal emission. The 2007 periastron passage was observed in unprecedented details with Suzaku, Swift, XMM-Newton and Chandra missions. We present here the results of this campaign and compare them with previous observations. With these data we are able, for the first time, to study the details of the spectral evolution of the source over a 2 months period of the passage of the pulsar close to the Be star. New data confirm the pre-periastron spectral hardening, with the photon index reaching a value smaller than 1.5, observed during a local flux minimum. If the observed X-ray emission is due to the inverse Compton (IC) losses of the 10 MeV electrons, then such a hard spectrum can be a result of Coulomb losses, or can be related to the existence of the low-energy cut-off in the electron spectrum. Alternatively, if the X-ray emission is a synchrotron emission of very high energy electrons, the observed hard spectrum can be explained if the high energy electrons are cooled by IC emission in Klein-Nishina regime. Unfortunately the lack of simultaneous data in the TeV energy band prevents us from making a definite conclusion on the nature of the observed spectral hardening and, therefore, on the origin of the X-ray emission.
astro-ph.GA:We present mid-IR observations from Gemini/TReCS that spatially resolve the dust emission around SR 21. The protoplanetary disk around SR 21 is believed to have a cleared gap extending from stellocentric radii of ~0.5 AU to ~20 AU, based on modeling of the observed spectral energy distribution. Our new observations resolve the dust emission, and our data are inconsistent with the previous model. We require the disk to be completely cleared within ~10 AU, without the hot inner disk spanning ~0.25-0.5 AU posited previously. To fit the SED and mid-IR imaging data together, we propose a disk model with a large inner hole, but with a warm companion--possibly surrounded by circumstellar material of its own--residing near the outer edge of the cleared region. We also discuss a model with a narrow ring included in a large cleared inner disk region, and argue that it is difficult to reconcile with the data.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate which structures the 6.7 GHz methanol masers trace in the environment of high-mass protostar candidates by observing a homogenous sample of methanol masers selected from Torun surveys. We also probed their origins by looking for associated H II regions and IR emission. We selected 30 methanol sources with improved position accuracies achieved using MERLIN and another 3 from the literature. We imaged 31 of these using the European VLBI Network's expanded array of telescopes with 5-cm (6-GHz) receivers. We used the VLA to search for 8.4 GHz radio continuum counterparts and inspected Spitzer GLIMPSE data at 3.6-8 um from the archive. High angular resolution images allowed us to analyze the morphology and kinematics of the methanol masers in great detail and verify their association with radio continuum and mid-infrared emission. A new class of "ring-like" methanol masers in star--forming regions appeared to be suprisingly common, 29 % of the sample. The new morphology strongly suggests that methanol masers originate in the disc or torus around a proto- or a young massive star. However, the maser kinematics indicate the strong influence of outflow or infall. This suggests that they form at the interface between the disc/torus and a flow. This is also strongly supported by Spitzer results because the majority of the masers coincide with 4.5 um emission to within less than 1 arcsec. Only four masers are associated with the central parts of UC H II regions. This implies that 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission occurs before H II region observable at cm wavelengths is formed.
astro-ph.GA:Theoretical arguments along with observational data of YSO jets suggest the presence of two steady components: a disk wind type outflow needed to explain the observed high mass loss rates and a stellar wind type outflow probably accounting for the observed stellar spin down.   Each component's contribution depends on the intrinsic physical properties of the YSO-disk system and its evolutionary stage. The main goal of this paper is to understand some of the basic features of the evolution, interaction and co-existence of the two jet components over a parameter space and when time variability is enforced. Having studied separately the numerical evolution of each type of the complementary disk and stellar analytical wind solutions in Paper I of this series, we proceed here to mix together the two models inside the computational box. The evolution in time is performed with the PLUTO code, investigating the dynamics of the two-component jets, the modifications each solution undergoes and the potential steady state reached.
astro-ph.GA:We present a summary of our previous investigations of the physical and chemical structure of the Horsehead nebula, and discuss how these studies led to advances on the understanding of the impact of FUV radiation on the structure of dense interstellar clouds. Specific molecular tracers can be used to isolate different environments, that are more sensitive to changes in the FUV radiation or density than the classical tracers of molecular gas : the CO isotopologues or the dust (sub)millimeter continuum emission. They include the HCO or CCH radicals for the FUV illuminated interfaces, or the molecular ions H$^{13}$CO$^+$, DCO$^+$ and other deuterated species (DNC, DCN) for the cold dense core. We discuss future prospects in the context of Herschel and ALMA.
astro-ph.GA:We used the multiplex capabilities of the AAOmega spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope to create a half-square-degree map of the neutral and low-ionized ISM in front of the nearby (~5 kpc), most massive Galactic globular cluster, omega Centauri. Its redshifted, metal-poor and hot horizontal branch stars probe the medium-strong Ca II K and Na I D2 line absorption, and weak absorption in the lambda5780 and lambda5797 Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs), on scales around a parsec. The kinematical and thermodynamical picture emerging from these data is that we predominantly probe the warm neutral medium and weakly-ionized medium of the Galactic Disc-Halo interface, ~0.3-1 kpc above the mid-plane. A comparison with Spitzer Space Telescope 24-micron and DIRBE/IRAS maps of the warm and cold dust emission confirms that both Na I and Ca II trace the overall column density of the warm neutral and weakly-ionized medium. Clear signatures are seen of the depletion of calcium atoms from the gas phase into dust grains. Curiously, the coarse DIRBE/IRAS map is a more reliable representation of the relative reddening between sightlines than the Na I and Ca II absorption-line measurements, most likely because the latter are sensitive to fluctuations in the local ionization conditions. The behaviour of the DIBs is consistent with the lambda5780 band being stronger than the lambda5797 band in regions where the ultraviolet radiation level is relatively high, as in the Disc-Halo interface. This region corresponds to a sigma-type cloud. In all, our maps and simple analytical model calculations show in unprecedented detail that small-scale density and/or ionization structures exist in the extra-planar gas of a spiral galaxy.

astro-ph.GA:We present new far-infrared (FIR) images of the edge-on starburst galaxy NGC253 obtained with the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard AKARI at wavelengths of 90 um and 140 um. We have clearly detected FIR dust emission extended in the halo of the galaxy; there are two filamentary emission structures extending from the galactic disk up to 9 kpc in the northern and 6 kpc in the northwestern direction. From its spatial coincidence with the X-ray plasma outflow, the extended FIR emission is very likely to represent outflowing dust entrained by superwinds. The ratios of surface brightness at 90 um to that at 140 um suggest that the temperatures of the dust in the halo are getting higher in the regions far from the disk, implying that there exist extra dust heating sources in the halo of the galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:This work aims to the study of the Sh 2-307 HII region and related stellar population. Near-infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations in the direction of Sh 2-307 were performed using OSIRIS at SOAR Telescope. From J-, H- and K-band spectra of the brightest source in the cluster, we conclude that it has a near-infrared spectra compatible with that taken for O9v-O9.5v stars. Using the derived spectral type and the respective J, H and K-band photometry, we compute a heliocentric distance of 3.2(0.5) kpc, which for R0 = 8 kpc, puts this cluster at more than 10 kpc from the Galactic centre. From the Brg, H2, and continuum narrow-band images we were able to detect both the NIR counterpart of the associated HII region, as well as, the interface between the ionised and the cool molecular gas. Using the 5 Ghz continuum flux density taken from the PMN catalogue and the Brg narrow band image we estimate that the HII region has a mean diameter of 0.94(0.15) pc, mean electron density of 550 cm-3 and an estimated dynamical age of 1.6 Myears years. The large fraction of sources presenting excess emission at 2micron suggests that the stellar population is very young, with many sources still in the pre-main sequence accreting phase. By the use of theoretical pre-main sequence tracks we derived a cluster mean age of about 2.5 Myears, and from the analyses of the fraction of excess emission sources as a function of their spatial distribution we found evidence for an age spread for the embedded pre-main sequence stellar population. Finally, from the study of the spatial distribution of the low-mass sources relative to the main-cluster source and associated photo-dissociation zones, we conclude that the O-type star probably has been triggering the star formation process in the region.
astro-ph.GA:A sample of large northern Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) galaxies has recently been observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). We present observations of the linearly polarized radio continuum emission in this WSRT-SINGS galaxy sample. Of the 28 galaxies treated in this paper, 21 are detected in polarized radio continuum at 18- and 22-cm wavelengths. We utilize the rotation measure synthesis (RM-Synthesis) method, as implemented by Brentjens & de Bruyn, to coherently detect polarized emission from a large fractional bandwidth, while simultaneously assessing the degree of Faraday rotation experienced by the radiation along each line-of-sight. This represents the first time that the polarized emission and its Faraday rotation have been systematically probed down to ~10 microJy/beam RMS for a large sample of galaxies. Non-zero Faraday rotation is found to be ubiquitous in all of the target fields, from both the Galactic foreground and the target galaxies themselves. In this paper, we present an overview of the polarized emission detected in each of the WSRT-SINGS galaxies. The most prominent trend is a systematic modulation of the polarized intensity with galactic azimuth, such that a global minimum in the polarized intensity is seen toward the kinematically receding major axis. The implied large-scale magnetic field geometry is discussed in a companion paper. A second novel result is the detection of multiple nuclear Faraday depth components that are offset to both positive and negative RM by 100-200 rad/m^2 in all targets that host polarized (circum-)nuclear emission.
astro-ph.GA:We calculate the evolution of molecular line profiles of HCO$^+$ and C$^{18}$O toward a dense core thatis forming inside a magnetized turbulent molecular cloud. Features of the profiles can be affected more significantly by coupled velocity and abundance structures in the outer region than those in the inner dense part of the core. The velocity structure at large radii is dominated by a turbulent flow nearby and accretion shocks onto the core, which resulting in the variation between inward and outward motions during the evolution of the core. The chemical abundance structure is significantly affected by the depletion of molecules in the central region with high density and low temperature. During the evolution of the core, the asymmetry of line profiles easily changes from blue to red, and vice versa. According to our study, the observed reversed (red) asymmetry toward some starless cores could be interpreted as an intrinsic result of outward motion in the outer region of a dense core, which is embedded in a turbulent environment and still grows in density at the center.
astro-ph.GA:Recent observations as well as theoretical studies of YSO jets suggest the presence of two steady components: a disk wind type outflow needed to explain the observed high mass loss rates and a stellar wind type outflow probably accounting for the observed stellar spin down. In this framework, we construct numerical two-component jet models by properly mixing an analytical disk wind solution with a complementary analytically derived stellar outflow. Their combination is controlled by both spatial and temporal parameters, in order to address different physical conditions and time variable features. We study the temporal evolution and the interaction of the two jet components on both small and large scales. The simulations reach steady state configurations close to the initial solutions. Although time variability is not found to considerably affect the dynamics, flow fluctuations generate condensations, whose large scale structures have a strong resemblance to observed YSO jet knots.
astro-ph.GA:By using high-resolution 1D hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the effects of purely mechanical feedback from super massive black holes (SMBHs) in the evolution of elliptical galaxies for a broad range of feedback efficiencies and compare the results to four major observational constraints. In particular, we focus on 1) the central black hole to stellar mass ratio of the host galaxy, 2) the lifetime of the luminous quasar phase, 3) the mass of stars formed in the host galaxy within the last Gyr, and 4) the X-ray luminosity of the hot diffuse gas. As a result, we try to pin down the most successful range of mechanical feedback efficiencies. We find that while low feedback efficiencies result in too much growth of the SMBH, high efficiencies totally blow out the hot interstellar gas, and the models are characterized by very low thermal X-ray luminosity well below the observed range. The net lifetime of the quasar phase is strongly coupled to the mass ratio between SMBH and its host galaxy, while the X-ray luminosity is generally correlated to the recent star formation within the last Gyr. When considering the popularly adopted model of the constant feedback efficiency, the feedback energy deposited into the ambient medium should be more than 0.01% of the SMBH accretion energy to be consistent with the SMBH mass to stellar mass ratio in the local universe. Yet, the X-ray luminosity of the hot gas favors about 0.005% of the accretion energy as the mechanical AGN feedback energy. We conclude that the purely mechanical feedback mode is unlikely to be simultaneously compatible with all four observable tests, even allowing a broad range of feedback efficiencies, and that including both radiative and mechanical feedback together may be a solution to comply the observational constraints.

astro-ph.GA:Using the data obtained with the Spitzer Space telescope as part of the Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution (SAGE) legacy survey, we have studied the variations of the dust composition and abundance across the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Such variations are expected, as the explosive events which have lead to the formation of the many HI shells observed should have affected the dust properties. Using a model and comparing with a reference spectral energy distribution from our Galaxy, we deduce the relative abundance variations of small dust grains across the LMC. We examined the infrared color ratios as well as the relative abundances of very small grains (VSGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) relative to the big grain (BG) abundance. Results show that each dust component could have different origins or evolution in the interstellar medium (ISM). The VSG abundance traces the star formation activity and could result from shattering of larger grains, whereas the PAH abundance increases around molecular clouds as well as in the stellar bar, where they could have been injected into the ISM during mass loss from old stars.
astro-ph.GA:So far, six mechanisms have been proposed to account for the Galactic disk heating. Of these, the most important appear to be a combination of scattering of stars by molecular clouds and by spiral arms. We study a further mechanism, namely, the repeated disk impact of the original Galactic Globular Cluster population up to the present. We find that Globular Clusters could have contributed at most a small fraction of the current vertical energy of the disk, as they could heat the whole disk to {$\sigma $}$_{z}$ = 5.5kms$^{{\rm -} {\rm 1}}$ (c.f. the observed 18 and 39 kms$^{{\rm -} {\rm 1}}$ for the thick and thin disks respectively). We find that the rate of rise of disk heat ($\alpha$=0.22 in \textit{$\sigma $}$_{z}$ $\sim t^{\alpha}$ with \textit t being time), is close to that found for scattering by molecular clouds.
astro-ph.GA:We use the data of Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper (WHAM) to test the hypothesis of whether the amplitudes and spectrum of density fluctuations measured by WHAM can be matched to the data obtained for interstellar scintillations and scattering. To do this, first of all, we adjusted the mean level of signal in the adjacent patches of the data. Then, assuming that the spectrum is Kolmogorov, we successfully matched the amplitudes of turbulence obtained from the WHAM data and the interstellar density fluctuations reported in the existing literature. As a result, we conclude that the existing data is consistent with the Kolmogorov cascade which spans from $10^6$ to $10^{17}$ $m$.
astro-ph.GA:We detail an innovative new technique for measuring the 2-D velocity moments (rotation velocity, velocity dispersion and Gauss-Hermite coefficients h$_3$ and h$_4$) of the stellar populations of galaxy halos using spectra from Keck DEIMOS multi-object spectroscopic observations. The data are used to reconstruct 2-D rotation velocity maps.   Here we present data for five nearby early-type galaxies to ~3 effective radii. We provide significant insights into the global kinematic structure of these galaxies, and challenge the accepted morphological classification in several cases. We show that between 1-3 effective radii the velocity dispersion declines very slowly, if at all, in all five galaxies. For the two galaxies with velocity dispersion profiles available from planetary nebulae data we find very good agreement with our stellar profiles. We find a variety of rotation profiles beyond 1 effective radius, i.e rotation speed remaining constant, decreasing \emph{and} increasing with radius. These results are of particular importance to studies which attempt to classify galaxies by their kinematic structure within one effective radius, such as the recent definition of fast- and slow- rotator classes by the SAURON project. Our data suggests that the rotator class may change when larger galacto-centric radii are probed. This has important implications for dynamical modeling of early-type galaxies. The data from this study are available on-line.
astro-ph.GA:We show that the Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream can be traced with very red K/M-giant stars selected from SDSS photometry. A subset of these stars are spectroscopically confirmed with SEGUE and SDSS spectra, and the distance scale of 2MASS and SDSS M giants is calibrated to the RR Lyrae distance scale. The absolute g band magnitude of the K/M-giant stars at the tip of the giant branch is M_g=-1.0. The line-of-sight velocities of the M giant and BHB stars that are spatially coincident with the Sgr dwarf tidal stream are consistent with those of previous authors, reinforcing the need for new models that can explain all of the Sgr tidal debris stream observations. We estimate stellar densities along the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. The K/M-giant, BHB, and F-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness tidal stream that is adjacent to the main leading Sgr dwarf tidal tail have velocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars in the leading tidal tail. The ratio of K/M giants to BHBs and BHBs to F-turnoff stars are also similar for both branches of the leading tidal tail. We show that there is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream near the Sgr trailing tidal tail.
astro-ph.GA:We study the short- and long-term effects of an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) on the orbits of stars bound to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the Milky Way. A regularized N-body code including post-Newtonian terms is used to carry out direct integrations of 19 stars in the S-star cluster for 10 Myr. The mass of the IMBH is assigned one of four values from 400 Msun to 4000 Msun, and its initial semi-major axis with respect to the SMBH is varied from 0.3-30 mpc, bracketing the radii at which inspiral of the IMBH is expected to stall. We consider two values for the eccentricity of the IMBH/SMBH binary, e=(0,0.7), and 12 values for the orientation of the binary's plane. Changes at the level of 1% in the orbital elements of the S-stars could occur in just a few years if the IMBH is sufficiently massive. On time scales of 1 Myr or longer, the IMBH efficiently randomizes the eccentricities and orbital inclinations of the S-stars. Kozai oscillations are observed when the IMBH lies well outside the orbits of the stars. Perturbations from the IMBH can eject stars from the cluster, producing hypervelocity stars, and can also scatter stars into the SMBH; stars with high initial eccentricities are most likely to be affected in both cases. The distribution of S-star orbital elements is significantly altered from its currently-observed form by IMBHs with masses greater than 1000 Msun if the IMBH/SMBH semi-major axis lies in the range 3-10 mpc. We use these results to further constrain the allowed parameters of an IMBH/SMBH binary at the Galactic center.
astro-ph.GA:The gas-phase chemistry of water in protoplanetary disks is analyzed with a model based on X-ray heating and ionization of the disk atmosphere. Several uncertain processes appear to play critical roles in generating the column densities of warm water that are detected from disks at infrared wavelengths. The dominant factors are the reactions that form molecular hydrogen, including formation on warm grains, and the ionization and heating of the atmosphere. All of these can work together to produce a region of high water abundances in the molecular transition layer of the inner disk atmosphere, where atoms are transformed into molecules, the temperature drops from thousands to hundreds of Kelvins, and the ionization begins to be dominated by the heavy elements. Grain formation of molecular hydrogen and mechanical heating of the atmosphere can play important roles in this region and directly affect the amount of warm water in protoplanetary disk atmospheres. Thus it may be possible to account for the existing measurements of water emission from Tauri disks without invoking transport of water from cooler to warmer regions. The hydroxyl radical OH is under-abundant in this model of disk atmospheres and requires consideration of additional production and excitation processes.
astro-ph.GA:There are two families of luminous elliptical galaxies: cusp galaxies, with steep central surface-brightness profiles, and core galaxies, whose surface-brightness profiles have flat central cores. Thermal evaporation of accreted cold gas by the hot interstellar medium may be at the origin of this cusp-core dichotomy: in less massive (hot-gas poor) galaxies central cores are likely to be refilled by central starbursts following cold gas infall, while in more massive (hot-gas rich) galaxies most cold gas is eliminated and central cores survive. This scenario is consistent with the observation that cusp and core galaxies differ systematically in terms of optical luminosity, X-ray gas content, age of the central stellar population, and properties of the active galactic nucleus.
astro-ph.GA:We present a detailed kinematical analysis of the young compact hourglass-shaped planetary nebula Hb 12. We performed optical imaging and longslit spectroscopy of Hb 12 using the Manchester echelle spectrometer with the 2.1m San Pedro Martir telescope. We reveal, for the first time, the presence of end caps (or knots) aligned with the bipolar lobes of the planetary nebula shell in a deep [NII]6584 image of Hb 12. We measured from our spectroscopy radial velocities of 120 km/s for these knots. We have derived the inclination angle of the hourglass shaped nebular shell to be 65 degrees to the line of sight. It has been suggested that Hb 12's central star system is an eclipsing binary (Hsia et al. 2006) which would imply a binary inclination of at least 80 degrees. However, if the central binary has been the major shaping influence on the nebula then both nebula and binary would be expected to share a common inclination angle. Finally, we report the discovery of high-velocity knots with Hubble-type velocities, close to the core of Hb 12, observed in Halpha and oriented in the same direction as the end caps. Very different velocities and kinematical ages were calculated for the outer and inner knots showing that they may originate from different outburst events.
astro-ph.GA:A widely supported formation scenario for the Galactic disc is that it formed inside-out from material accumulated via accretion events. The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) is the best example of a such accretion, and its ongoing disruption has resulted in that its stars are being deposited in the Milky Way halo and outer disc. It is therefore appealing to search for possible signatures of the Sgr dSph contribution to the build-up of the Galactic disc. Interestingly, models of the Sgr dSph stream indicate clearly that the trailing tail passes through the outer Galactic disc, at the same galactocentric distance as some anti-centre old open star clusters. We investigate in this Letter the possibility that the two outermost old open clusters, Berkeley~29 and Saurer~1, could have formed inside the Sgr dSph and then left behind in the outer Galactic disc as a result of tidal interaction with the Milky Way. The actual location of these two star clusters, inside the Sgr dSph trailing tail, is compatible with this scenario, and their chemical and kinematical properties, together with our present understanding of the age-metallicity relationship in the Sgr dSph, lends further support to this possible association. Hence, we find it likely that the old open star clusters Berkeley~29 and Saurer~1 have extra-galactic origins.
astro-ph.GA:We present HST WFPC2/PC images and KPNO 4-m longslit spectroscopy of the QSO SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, which we advanced as a candidate binary supermassive black hole. The images reveal a close companion coincident with the radio source identified by Wrobel & Laor (2009). It appears to be consistent with a M_g ~ -21.4 elliptical galaxy, if it is at the QSO redshift. The spectroscopy, however, shows no spatial offset of the red or blue Balmer line subcomponents. The companion is thus not the source of either the red or blue broad line systems; SDSS J153636.22+044127.0 cannot be explained as a chance superposition of objects, or as an ejected black hole. Over the Delta T=0.75 yr difference between the rest frame epochs of the present and SDSS spectroscopy, we find no velocity shift to within 40 km/s, nor any amplitude change in either broad line system. The lack of a shift can be admitted under the binary hypothesis if the implied radial velocity is a larger component of the full orbital velocity than was assumed in our earlier work. A strong test of the binary hypothesis requires yet longer temporal baselines. The lack of amplitude variations is unusual for the alternative explanation of this object as a "double-peaked" emitter; we further argue that SDSS J153636.22+044127.0 has unique spectral features that have no obvious analogue with other members of this class.
astro-ph.GA:We present distance determinations for two Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies, Carina and Fornax, based on the near-infrared magnitudes of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). For Carina we derive true distance moduli of 20.09 and 20.13 mag in the J and K bands, respectively, while for Fornax the same distance modulus of 20.84 mag was derived in both filters. The statistical errors of these determinations are of order 0.03-0.04 mag, whereas the systematic uncertainties on the distances are 0.12 mag in the J band and 0.14 mag in the K band. The distances obtained from the near-infrared TRGB method in this paper agree very well with those obtained for these two galaxies from optical calibrations of the TRGB method, their horizontal branches, RR Lyrae variables, and the near-infrared magnitudes of their red clumps.
astro-ph.GA:We have formed a new sample which consists of extended extragalactic radio sources without obvious active galactic nuclei (AGN) in them. Most of these sources appear to be dead double radio sources. These sources with steep spectra ($\alpha < $ -1.8; S $\propto \nu^{\alpha}$) were identified using the 74 (VLSS) and the 1400 MHz (NVSS) surveys and further imaged using the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Giant Meterwave RadioTelescope (GMRT). The radio morphologies of these sources are rather unusual in the sense that no obvious cores and jets are detected in these sources, but, two extended lobes are detected in most. The mean redshift of 4 of the 10 sources reported here is $\sim$ 0.2. At a redshift of 0.2, the linear extents of the sources in the current sample are $\sim$ 250 kpc with their spectral luminosities at 1.4 GHz in the range 2-25 x 10$^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. The steep spectra of these sources is a result of the cessation of AGN activities in them about 15 -- 100 million years ago. Before the cessation of AGN activity, the radio luminosities of these galaxies were $\sim$ 1000 times brighter than their current luminosities and would have been comparable to those of the brightest active radio galaxies detected in the local universe (L$_{1.4} \sim$ 10$^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). The dead radio galaxies reported here represent the $'$tip of the iceberg$'$ and quantifying the abundance of such a population has important implications to the life cycle of the AGN.
astro-ph.GA:It is an open question why the temperature of molecular gas in the Galactic center region is higher than that of dust. To address this problem, we made simultaneous observations in the NH_3 (J,K) = (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) lines of the central molecular zone (CMZ) using the Kagoshima 6 m telescope. The ortho-to-para ratio of NH_3 molecules in the CMZ is 1.5--3.5 at most observed area. This ratio is higher than the statistical equilibrium value, and suggests that the formation temperature of NH_3 is 11--20 K. This temperature is similar to the dust temperature estimated from the submillimeter and infrared continuum. This result suggests that the NH_3 molecules in the CMZ were produced on dust grains with the currently observed temperature (11--20 K), and they were released into the gas phase by supernova shocks or collisions of dust particles. The discrepancy between warm molecular gas and cold dust can be explained by the transient heating of the interstellar media in the CMZ approximately 10^5 years ago when the NH_3 molecules were released from the dust.
astro-ph.GA:We report on the discovery of three new pulsars in the first blind survey of the north Galactic plane (45 degrees < l < 135 degrees; |b| < 1 degrees with the Giant Meterwave Radio telescope (GMRT) at an intermediate frequency of 610 MHz. The survey covered 106 square degrees with a sensitivity of roughly 1 mJy to long-period pulsars (pulsars with period longer than 1 s). The three new pulsars have periods of 318, 933, and 1056 ms. Their timing parameters and flux densities, obtained in follow up observations with the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank and the GMRT, are presented. We also report on pulse nulling behaviour in one of the newly discovered pulsars, PSR J2208+5500.
astro-ph.GA:Time series are presented for the class II methanol maser source G12.89+0.49, which has been monitored for nine years at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory. The 12.2 and 6.7 GHz methanol masers were seen to exhibit rapid, correlated variations on timescales of less than a month. Daily monitoring has revealed that the variations have a periodic component with a period of 29.5 days. The period seems to be stable over the 110 cycles spanned by the time series. There are variations from cycle to cycle, with the peak of the flare occurring anywhere within an eleven day window but the minima occur at the same phase of the cycle. Time delays of up to 5.7 days are seen between spectral features at 6.7 GHz and a delay of 1.1 day is seen between the dominant 12.2 GHz spectral feature and its 6.7 GHz counterpart.
astro-ph.GA:We study the mass spectrum of sub-structures in the Perseus Molecular Cloud Complex traced by 13CO (1-0), finding that $dN/dM\propto M^{-2.4}$ for the standard Clumpfind parameters. This result does not agree with the classical $dN/dM\propto M^{-1.6}$. To understand this discrepancy we study the robustness of the mass spectrum derived using the Clumpfind algorithm. Both 2D and 3D Clumpfind versions are tested, using 850 $\mu$m dust emission and 13CO spectral-line observations of Perseus, respectively. The effect of varying threshold is not important, but varying stepsize produces a different effect for 2D and 3D cases. In the 2D case, where emission is relatively isolated (associated with only the densest peaks in the cloud), the mass spectrum variability is negligible compared to the mass function fit uncertainties. In the 3D case, however, where the 13CO emission traces the bulk of the molecular cloud, the number of clumps and the derived mass spectrum are highly correlated with the stepsize used. The distinction between "2D" and "3D" here is more importantly also a distinction between "sparse" and "crowded" emission. In any "crowded" case, Clumpfind should not be used blindly to derive mass functions. Clumpfind's output in the "crowded" case can still offer a statistical description of emission useful in inter-comparisons, but the clump-list should not be treated as a robust region decomposition suitable to generate a physically-meaningful mass function. We conclude that the 13CO mass spectrum depends on the observations resolution, due to the hierarchical structure of MC.
astro-ph.GA:Observations of the Galactic Centre show evidence of one or two disc-like structures of very young stars orbiting the central super-massive black hole within a distance of a few 0.1 pc. A number of analyses have been carried out to investigate the dynamical behaviour and consequences of these discs, including disc thickness and eccentricity growth as well as mutual interaction and warping. However, most of these studies have neglected the influence of the stellar cusp surrounding the black hole, which is believed to be 1-2 orders of magnitude more massive than the disc(s).   By means of N-body integrations using our bhint code, we study the impact of stellar cusps of different compositions. We find that although the presence of a cusp does have an important effect on the evolution of an otherwise isolated flat disc, its influence on the evolution of disc thickness and warping is rather mild in a two-disc configuration. However, we show that the creation of highly eccentric orbits strongly depends on the graininess of the cusp (i.e. the mean and maximum stellar masses): While Chang (2009) recently found that full cycles of Kozai resonance are prevented by the presence of an analytic cusp, we show that relaxation processes play an important role in such highly dense regions and support short-term resonances. We thus find that young disc stars on initially circular orbits can achieve high eccentricities by resonant effects also in the presence of a cusp of stellar remnants, yielding a mechanism to create S-stars and hyper-velocity stars.   Furthermore, we discuss the underlying initial mass function (IMF) of the young stellar discs and find no definite evidence for a non-canonical IMF.
astro-ph.GA:In the Galactic fountain scenario, supernovae and/or stellar winds propel material into the Galactic halo. As the material cools, it condenses into clouds. By using FLASH three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we model and study the dynamical evolution of these gas clouds after they form and begin to fall toward the Galactic plane. In our simulations, we assume that the gas clouds form at a height of z=5 kpc above the Galactic midplane, then begin to fall from rest. We investigate how the cloud's evolution, dynamics, and interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM) are affected by the initial mass of the cloud. We find that clouds with sufficiently large initial densities (> 0.1 hydrogen atoms per cc) accelerate sufficiently and maintain sufficiently large column densities as to be observed and identified as high-velocity clouds (HVCs) even if the ISM is weakly magnetized (1.3 micro Gauss). We also investigate the effects of various possible magnetic field configurations. As expected, the ISM's resistance is greatest when the magnetic field is strong and perpendicular to the motion of the cloud. The trajectory of the cloud is guided by the magnetic field lines in cases where the magnetic field is oriented diagonal to the Galactic plane. The model cloud simulations show that the interactions between the cloud and the ISM can be understood via analogy to the shock tube problem which involves shock and rarefaction waves. We also discuss accelerated ambient gas, streamers of material ablated from the clouds, and the cloud's evolution from a sphere-shaped to a disk- or cigar-shaped object.
astro-ph.GA:We present new radio recombination line observations of the previously unstudied HII region CTB 102. Line parameters are extracted and physical parameters describing the gas are calculated. We estimate the distance to CTB 102 to be 4.3 kpc. Through comparisons with HI and 1.42 GHz radio continuum data, we estimate the size of CTB 102 to be 100-130 pc, making it one of the largest HII regions known, comparable to the W4 complex. A stellar wind blown bubble model is presented as the best explanation for the observed morphology, size and velocities.
astro-ph.GA:We present the first detection of neutral atomic oxygen (3P_1-3P_2 fine structure line at ~63um) toward the Horsehead photodissociation region (PDR). The cloud has been mapped with the Spitzer Space Telescope at far-IR (FIR) wavelengths using MIPS in the spectral energy distribution (SED) mode. The [OI]63um line peaks at the illuminated edge of the cloud at AV~0.1-0.5 (inward the gas becomes too cold and outward the gas density drops). The luminosity carried by the [OI]63um line represents a significant fraction of the total FIR dust luminosity (I_63/I_FIR~4x10^-3). We analyze the dust continuum emission and the nonlocal OI excitation and radiative transfer in detail. The observations are reproduced with a gas density of n_H~10^4 cm^-3 and gas and dust temperatures of T_k~100 K and T_d~30 K. We conclude that the determination of the OI 3P_J level populations and emergent line intensities at such ``low'' densities is a complex non-LTE problem. FIR radiative pumping, [OI]63um subthermal emission, [OI]145um suprathermal and even maser emission can occur and decrease the resulting [OI]63/145 intensity ratio. The Herschel Space Observatory, observing from ~55 to 672um, will allow us to exploit the diagnostic power of FIR fine structure lines with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.
astro-ph.GA:We estimate the enclosed mass profile in the central 10 pc of the Milky Way by analyzing the infrared photometry and the velocity observations of dynamically relaxed stellar population in the Galactic center. HST/NICMOS and Gemini Adaptive Optics images in the archive are used to obtain the number density profile, and proper motion and radial velocity data were compiled from the literature to find the velocity dispersion profile assuming a spherical symmetry and velocity isotropy. From these data, we calculate the enclosed mass and density profiles in the central 10 pc of the Galaxy using the Jeans equation. Our improved estimates can better describe the exact evolution of the molecular clouds and star clusters falling down to the Galactic center, and constrain the star formation history of the inner part of the Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:We present theoretical calculations of the X-ray scattering properties of porous grain aggregates with olivine monomers. The small and large angle scattering properties of these aggregates are governed by the global structure and substructure of the grain, respectively. We construct two diagnostics, R_X and T_X, based on the optical and X-ray properties of the aggregates, and apply them to a Chandra measurement of the dust halo around the Galactic binary GX13+1. Grain aggregates with porosities higher than about 0.55 are ruled out. Future high-precision observations of X-ray dust haloes together with detailed modeling of the X-ray scattering properties of porous grain mixtures will further constrain the presence of porous grain aggregates in a given dust population.
astro-ph.GA:Large organic molecules and carbon clusters are basic building blocks of life, but their existence in the universe has not been confirmed beyond doubt. A number of unidentified absorption features (arising in the diffuse inter-stellar medium), usually called ``Diffuse Inter-stellar Bands (DIBs)'', are hypothesized to be produced by large molecules. Among these, buckminsterfullerene C_60 has gained much attention as a candidate for DIB absorbers because of its high stability in space. Two DIBs at ~9577A and 9632A have been reported as possible features of C_60^+. However, it is still not clear how their existence depends on their environment. We obtained high-resolution spectra of three stars in/around the Orion Nebula, to search for any correlations of the DIB strength with carrier's physical conditions, such as dust-abundance and UV radiation field. We find three DIBs at ~9017A, 9210A, and 9258A as additional C_60^+ feature candidates, which could support this identification. These DIBs have asymmetric profiles similar to the longer wavelength features. However, we also find that the relative strengths of DIBs are close to unity and differ from laboratory measurements, a similar trend as noticed for the 9577/9632 DIBs.
astro-ph.GA:We present the light curves of the 6.7 and 12.2 GHz methanol masers in the star forming region G9.62+0.20E for a time span of more than 2600 days. The earlier reported period of 244 days is confirmed. The results of monitoring the 107 GHz methanol maser for two flares are also presented. The results show that flaring occurs in all three masing transitions. It is shown that the average flare profiles of the three masing transitions are similar. The 12.2 GHz masers are the most variable of the three masers with the largest relative amplitude having a value of 2.4. The flux densities for the different masing transitions are found to return to the same level during the low phase of the masers, suggesting that the source of the periodic flaring is situated outside the masing region, and that the physical conditions in the masing region are relatively stable. On the basis of the shape of the light curve we excluded stellar pulsations as the underlying mechanism for the periodicity. It is argued that a colliding wind binary can account for the observed periodicity and provide a mechanism to qualitatively explain periodicity in the seed photon flux and/or the pumping radiation field. It is also argued that the dust cooling time is too short to explain the decay time of about 100 days of the maser flare. A further analysis has shown that for the intervals from days 48 to 66 and from days 67 to 135 the decay of the maser light curve can be interpreted as due to the recombination of a thermal hydrogen plasma with densities of approximately $1.6 \times 10^6 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $6.0 \times 10^5 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ respectively.
astro-ph.GA:The Kuzmin-Toomre family of discs is used to construct potential-density pairs that represent flat ring structures in terms of elementary functions. Systems composed of two concentric flat rings, a central disc surrounded by one ring and a ring with a centre of attraction are also presented. The circular velocity of test particles and the epicyclic frequency of small oscillations about circular orbits are calculated for these structures. A few examples of three-dimensional potential-density pairs of "inflated" flat rings (toroidal mass distributions) are presented.
astro-ph.GA:Massive young stellar objects (YSOs), like low-mass YSOs, appear to be surrounded by optically thick envelopes and/or disks and have regions, often bipolar, that are seen in polarized scattered light at near-infrared wavelengths. We are using the 0.2'' spatial resolution of NICMOS on Hubble Space Telescope to examine the structure of the disks and outflow regions of massive YSOs in star-forming regions within a few kpc of the Sun. Here we report on 2 micron polarimetry of NGC 6334 V and S255 IRS1. NGC 6334 V consists of a double-lobed bright reflection nebula seen against a dark region, probably an optically thick molecular cloud. Our polarization measurements show that the illuminating star lies ~ 2'' south of the line connecting the two lobes; we do not detect this star at 2 micron, but there are a small radio source and a mid-infrared source at this location. S255 IRS1 consists of two YSOs (NIRS1 and NIRS3) with overlapping scattered light lobes and luminosities corresponding to early B stars. Included in IRS1 is a cluster of stars from whose polarization we determine the local magnetic field direction. Neither YSO has its scattered light lobes aligned with this magnetic field. The line connecting the scattered light lobes of NIRS1 is twisted symmetrically around the star; the best explanation is that the star is part of a close binary and the outflow axis of NIRS1 is precessing as a result of non-coplanar disk and orbit. The star NIRS3 is also offset from the line connecting its two scattered light lobes. We suggest that all three YSOs show evidence of episodic ejection of material as they accrete from dense, optically thick envelopes.
astro-ph.GA:Studying the environments of 0.4<z<1.2 UV-selected galaxies, as examples of extreme star-forming galaxies (with star formation rates in the range of 3-30 M_sol/yr), we explore the relationship between high rates of star-formation, host halo mass and pair fractions. We study the large-scale and small-scale environments of local Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies (UVLGs) by measuring angular correlation functions. We cross-correlate these systems with other galaxy samples: a volume-limited sample (ALL), a Blue Luminous Galaxy sample (BLG) and a Luminous Red Galaxy sample (LRG). We determine the UVLG comoving correlation length to be r_0=4.8(+11.6/-2.4) h^-1 Mpc at <z> =1.0, which is unable to constrain the halo mass for this sample. However, we find that UVLGs form close (separation < 30 kpc) pairs with the ALL sample, but do not frequently form pairs with LRGs. A rare subset of UVLGs, those with the highest FUV surface brightnesses, are believed to be local analogs of high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and are called Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs). LBGs and LBAs share similar characteristics (i.e., color, size, surface brightness, specific star formation rates, metallicities, and dust content). Recent HST images of z~0.2 LBAs show disturbed morphologies, signs of mergers and interactions. UVLGs may be influenced by interactions with other galaxies and we discuss this result in terms of other high star-forming, merging systems.
astro-ph.GA:We present data from Integral Field Spectroscopy for 3 supercompact UV-Luminous Galaxies (ScUVLGs). As nearby (z~0.2), compact (R_50~1-2 kpc), bright Paschen-alpha sources, with unusually high star formation rates (SFR=3-100 M_sun/yr), ScUVLGs are an ideal population for studying detailed kinematics and dynamics in actively star-forming galaxies. In addition, ScUVLGs appear to be excellent analogs to high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and our results may offer additional insight into the dynamics of LBGs. Previous work by our team has shown that the morphologies of these galaxies exhibit tidal features and companions, and in this study we find that the dynamics of ScUVLGs are dominated by disturbed kinematics of the emission line gas-- suggestive that these galaxies have undergone recent feedback, interactions or mergers. While 2 of the 3 galaxies do display rotation, v/sigma < 1 -- suggesting dispersion dominated kinematics rather than smooth rotation. We also simulate how these observations would appear at z~2. Lower resolution and loss of low surface brightness features causes some apparent discrepancies between the low-z (observed) and high-z (simulated) interpretations and quantitatively gives different values for v/sigma, yet simulations of these low-z analogs manage to detect the brightest regions well and resemble actual high-z observations of LBGs.
astro-ph.GA:We use the WMAP maximum entropy method foreground emission map combined with previously determined distances to giant HII regions to measure the free-free flux at Earth and the free-free luminosity of the galaxy. We find a total flux f_\nu=54211 Jy and a flux from 88 sources of f_\nu=36043 Jy. The bulk of the sources are at least marginally resolved, with mean radii ~60 pc, electron density n_e ~ 9 cm^{-3}, and filling factor \phi_{HII}=0.005 (over the Galactic gas disk). The total dust-corrected ionizing photon luminosity is Q=3.2x10^{53} photons/s, in good agreement with previous estimates. We use GLIMPSE and MSX 8 micron images to show that the bulk of the free-free luminosity is associated with bubbles having radii r~5-100 pc, with a mean ~20 pc. These bubbles are leaky, so that ionizing photons from inside the bubble excite free-free emission beyond the bubble walls, producing WMAP sources that are larger than the 8 micron bubbles. We suggest that the WMAP sources are the counterparts of the extended low density HII regions described by Mezger (1978). Half the ionizing luminosity from the sources is emitted by the nine most luminous objects, while the seventeen most luminous emit half the total Galactic ionizing flux. These 17 sources have 4x10^{51} < Q <1.6x10^{52}, corresponding to 6x10^4M_\odot < M_*< 2x10^5M_\odot; half to two thirds of this will be in the central massive star cluster. We convert the measurement of Q to a Galactic star formation rate dM/dt=1.3M_\odot/yr, but point out that this is highly dependent on the exponent \Gamma~1.35 of the high mass end of the stellar initial mass function.
astro-ph.GA:Astronomers recently discovered a non-trivial radial motion of stars within our galaxy and were able to reproduce the results using n-body numerics. I modeled a protoplanitary-like disk within a newtonian $\infty$-body problem and considered the stability of local trajectories giving a qualitative explanation to the observed radial motion. As a prospect there will be a short estimate on the impact on spiral arms.
astro-ph.GA:We have discovered a molecular dome-like feature towards $355^{\circ} \leq l \leq 359^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ} \leq b \leq 2^{\circ}$. The large velocity dispersions of 50--100 km s$^{-1}$ of this feature are much larger than those in the Galactic disk and indicate that the feature is located in the Galactic center, probably within $\sim1$ kpc of Sgr A$^{*}$. The distribution has a projected length of $\sim600$ pc and height of $\sim300$ pc from the Galactic disk and shows a large-scale monotonic velocity gradient of $\sim130$ km s $^{-1}$ per $\sim600$ pc. The feature is also associated with HI gas having a more continuous spatial and velocity distribution than that of $^{12}$CO. We interpret the feature as a magnetically floated loop similar to loops 1 and 2 and name it "loop 3". Loop 3 is similar to loops 1 and 2 in its height and length but is different from loops 1 and 2 in that the inner part of loop 3 is filled with molecular emission. We have identified two foot points at the both ends of loop 3. HI, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO datasets were used to estimate the total mass and kinetic energy of loop 3 to be $\sim3.0 \times 10^{6} \Mo$ and $\sim1.7 \times 10^{52}$ ergs. The huge size, velocity dispersions and energy are consistent with the magnetic origin the Parker instability as in case of loops 1 and 2 but is difficult to be explained by multiple stellar explosions. We argue that loop 3 is in an earlier evolutionary phase than loops 1 and 2 based on the inner-filled morphology and the relative weakness of the foot points. This discovery indicates that the western part of the nuclear gas disk of $\sim1$ kpc radius is dominated by the three well-developed magnetically floated loops and suggests that the dynamics of the nuclear gas disk is strongly affected by the magnetic instabilities.
astro-ph.GA:Finite thin disc models of four galaxies in the Ursa Major cluster are presented. The models are obtained by means of the Hunter method and the particular solutions are choosen in such a way that the circular velocities are adjusted very accurately to the observed rotation curves of some specific spiral galaxies. We present particular models for the four galaxies NGC3877, NGC3917, NGC3949 and NGC4010 with data taken from the recent paper by Verheijen & Sancici (2001). By integrating the corresponding surface mass densities, we obtain the total mass M of these four galaxies, all of them being of the order of 10^10 solar masses. These obtained values for M may be taken as a quite accurately estimative of the mass upper bound of these galaxies, since in the model was considered that all their mass was concentrated at the galactic disc. The models can be consider as a first approximation to the obtaining of quite realistic models of spiral galaxies
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the gravitational fragmentation of expanding shells in the context of the linear thin--shell analysis. We make use of two very different numerical schemes; the FLASH Adaptive Mesh Refinement code and a version of the Benz Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code. We find that the agreement between the two codes is excellent. We use our numerical results to test the thin--shell approximation and we find that the external pressure applied to the shell has a strong effect on the fragmentation process. In cases where shells are not pressure--confined, the shells thicken as they expand and hydrodynamic flows perpendicular to the plane of the shell suppress fragmentation at short wavelengths. If the shells are pressure--confined internally and externally, so that their thickness remains approximately constant during their expansion, the agreement with the analytical solution is better.
astro-ph.GA:Context. We have carried out a semi-automated search for planetary nebulae (PNe) in the INT Photometric H-Alpha Survey (IPHAS) catalogue. We present the PN search and the list of selected candidates. We cross correlate the selected candidates with a number of existing infrared galactic surveys in order to gain further insight into the nature of the candidates. Spectroscopy of a subset of objects is used to estimate the number of PNe present in the entire candidate list.   Aims. The overall aim of the IPHAS PN project is to carry out a deep census of PNe in the northern Galactic plane, an area where PN detections are clearly lacking.   Methods. The PN search is carried out on the IPHAS photometric catalogues. The candidate selection is based on the IPHAS and 2MASS/UKIDSS colours of the objects and the final candidate selection is made visually.   Results. From the original list of ~600 million IPHAS detections we have selected a total of 1005 objects. Of these, 224 are known objects, leaving us with 781 PN candidates. Based on the initial follow-up spectroscopy, we expect the list to include very young and proto-PNe in addition to genuine, normal PNe (~16 %) and emission line objects other than PNe. We present additional criteria to select the most probable PN candidates from our candidate list.
astro-ph.GA:The nearest young stellar groups are associated with "hubs" of column density exceeding 10^22 cm^-2, according to recent observations. These hubs radiate multiple "filaments" of parsec length, having lower column density and fewer stars. Systems with many filaments tend to have parallel filaments with similar spacing. Such "hub-filament structure" is associated with all of the nine young stellar groups within 300 pc, forming low-mass stars. Similar properties are seen in infrared dark clouds forming more massive stars. In a new model, an initial clump in a uniform medium is compressed into a self-gravitating, modulated layer. The outer layer resembles the modulated equilibrium of Schmid-Burgk (1967) with nearly parallel filaments. The filaments converge onto the compressed clump, which collapses to form stars with high efficiency. The initial medium and condensations have densities similar to those in nearby star-forming clouds and clumps. The predicted structures resemble observed hub-filament systems in their size, shape, and column density, and in the appearance of their filaments. These results suggest that hub-filament structure associated with young stellar groups may arise from compression of clumpy gas in molecular clouds.
astro-ph.GA:We present a spectroscopic study of the stellar cluster population of M82, the archetype starburst galaxy, based primarily on new Gemini-North multi-object spectroscopy of 49 star clusters. These observations constitute the largest to date spectroscopic dataset of extragalactic young clusters, giving virtually continuous coverage across the galaxy; we use these data to deduce information about the clusters as well as the M82 post-starburst disk and nuclear starburst environments. Spectroscopic age-dating places clusters in the nucleus and disk between (7, 15) and (30, 270) Myr, with distribution peaks at ~10 and ~140 Myr respectively. We find cluster radial velocities in the range (-160, 220) km/s (wrt the galaxy centre) and line of sight Na I D interstellar absorption line velocities in (-75, 200) km/s, in many cases entirely decoupled from the clusters. As the disk cluster radial velocities lie on the flat part of the galaxy rotation curve, we conclude that they comprise a regularly orbiting system. Our observations suggest that the largest part of the population was created as a result of the close encounter with M81 ~220 Myr ago. Clusters in the nucleus are found in solid body rotation on the bar. The possible detection of WR features in their spectra indicates that cluster formation continues in the central starburst zone. We also report the potential discovery of two old populous clusters in the halo of M82, aged >8 Gyr. Using these measurements and simple dynamical considerations, we derive a toy model for the invisible physical structure of the galaxy, and confirm the existence of two dominant spiral arms.
astro-ph.GA:Fukui et al. (2006) discovered two huge molecular loops in the Galactic center located in (l, b) ~ (355 deg-359 deg, 0 deg-2 deg) in a large velocity range of -180-40 km s^-1. Following the discovery, we present detailed observational properties of the two loops based on NANTEN 12CO(J=1-0) and 13CO(J=1-0) datasets at 10 pc resolution including a complete set of velocity channel distributions and comparisons with HI and dust emissions as well as with the other broad molecular features. We find new features on smaller scales in the loops including helical distributions in the loop tops and vertical spurs. The loops have counterparts of the HI gas indicating that the loops include atomic gas. The IRAS far infrared emission is also associated with the loops and was used to derive an X-factor of 0.7(+/-0.1){\times}10^20 cm^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1 to convert the 12CO intensity into the total molecular hydrogen column density. From the 12CO, 13CO, H I and dust datasets we estimated the total mass of loops 1 and 2 to be ~1.4 {\times} 106 Msun and ~1.9 {\times} 10^6 Msun, respectively, where the H I mass corresponds to ~10-20% of the total mass and the total kinetic energy of the two loops to be ~10^52 ergs. An analysis of the kinematics of the loops yields that the loops are rotating at ~47 km s-1 and expanding at ~141 km s^-1 at a radius of 670 pc from the center. Fukui et al. (2006) presented a model that the loops are created by the magnetic flotation due to the Parker instability with an estimated magnetic field strength of ~150 {\mu}G. We present comparisons with the recent numerical simulations of the magnetized nuclear disk by Machida et al. (2009) and Takahashi et al. (2009) and show that the theoretical results are in good agreements with the observations. The helical distributions also suggest that some magnetic instability plays a role similarly to the solar helical features.
astro-ph.GA:Measurements based on a large number of red giant stars suggest a broad metallicity distribution function (MDF) for the Galactic bulge, centered on [Fe/H]=-0.1. However, recently, a new opportunity emerged to utilize temporary flux amplification (by factors of ~100 or more) of faint dwarf stars in the Bulge that are gravitationally lensed, making them observable with high-resolution spectrographs during a short observational window. Surprisingly, of the first 6 stars measured, 5 have [Fe/H]>+0.30, suggesting a highly skewed MDF, inconsistent with observations of giant stars. Here we present a detailed elemental abundance analysis of OGLE-2009-BLG-076S, based on a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the ESO Very Large Telescope. Our results indicate it is the most metal-poor dwarf star in the Bulge yet observed, with [Fe/H]=-0.76. Our results argue against a strong selection effect disfavoring metal-poor microlensed stars. It is possible that small number statistics is responsible for the giant/dwarf Bulge MDF discrepancy. Should this discrepancy survive when larger numbers of Bulge dwarf stars (soon to be available) are analyzed, it may require modification of our understanding of either Bulge formation models, or the behavior of metal-rich giant stars.
astro-ph.GA:The Orion Bar is one of the nearest and best-studied photodissociation or photon-dominated regions (PDRs). Observations reveal the presence of H2 lines from vibrationally or rotationally excited upper levels that suggest warm gas temperatures (400 to 700 K). However, standard models of PDRs are unable to reproduce such warm rotational temperatures. In this paper we attempt to explain these observations with new comprehensive models which extend from the H+ region through the Bar and include the magnetic field in the equation of state. We adopt the model parameters from our previous paper which successfully reproduced a wide variety of spectral observations across the Bar. In this model the local cosmic-ray density is enhanced above the galactic background, as is the magnetic field, and which increases the cosmic-ray heating elevating the temperature in the molecular region. The pressure is further enhanced above the gas pressure in the H+ region by the momentum transferred from the absorbed starlight. Here we investigate whether the observed H2 lines can be reproduced with standard assumptions concerning the grain photoelectric emission. We also explore the effects due to the inclusion of recently computed H2 + H2, H2 + H and H2 + He collisional rate coefficients.
astro-ph.GA:We present new parsec-scale resolution data from a multi-phase study of the ISM in the walls of Galactic supershells. HI synthesis images and CO survey data reveal a wealth of substructure, including dense-tipped fingers and extended molecular clouds embedded in shell walls. We briefly consider formation scenarios for these features, and suggest that both the interaction of an expanding shell with pre-existing dense clouds, as well as in-situ formation of CNM and molecular gas, are likely to be relevant. Future work will also examine the role of instabilities in structure formation and breakup, and will investigate the presence of high-altitude gas associated with supershells and chimneys.
astro-ph.GA:The model of a Local Hot Bubble has been widely accepted as providing a framework that can explain the ubiquitous presence of the soft X-ray background diffuse emission. We summarize the current knowledge on this local interstellar region, paying particular reference to observations that sample emission from the presumed local million degree K hot plasma. However, we have listed numerous observations that are seemingly in conflict with the concept of a hot Local Bubble. In particular, the discovery of solar wind charge exchange that can generate an appreciable soft X-ray background signal within the heliosphere, has led to a reassessment of the generally accepted model that requires a hot local plasma. In order to explain the majority of observations of the local plasma, we forward two new speculative models that describe the physical state of the local interstellar gas. One possible scenario is similar to the present widely accepted model of the Local Hot Bubble, except that it accounts for only 50% of the soft X-ray emission currently detected in the galactic plane, has a lower thermal pressure than previously thought, and its hot plasma is not as hot as previously believed. Although such a model can solve several difficulties with the traditional hot Local Bubble model, a heating mechanism for the dimmer and cooler gas remains to be found. The second possible explanation is that of the Hot Top model, in which the Local Cavity is an old supernova remnant in which no (or very little) million degree local plasma is presently required. Instead, the cavity is now thought to be filled with partially ionized cloudlets of temperature 7000 K that are surrounded by lower density envelopes of photoionized gas of temperature 20,000 K.
astro-ph.GA:A bright UV GALEX image in the direction of a dense high galactic latitude interstellar dust cloud is examined to test (and to reject) the idea that a bright extragalactic UV background radiation field exists. A GALEX "Deep Imaging Survey" image of a second high latitude region (a region almost totally free of dust) shows a similar bright background, which, clearly, cannot be due to starlight scattered from interstellar dust. I speculate that the background is due to dark matter particles interacting with interstellar gas/dust nucleons.
astro-ph.GA:We present optical ($UBVI_C$) observations of a rich and complex field in the Galactic plane towards $l \sim 305^{\circ}$ and $b \sim 0^{\circ}$. Our analysis reveals a significantly high interstellar absorbtion ($A_V \sim 10$) and an abnormal extinction law in this line of sight. Availing a considerable number of color combinations, the photometric diagrams allow us to derive new estimates of the fundamental parameters of the two open clusters Danks~1 and Danks~2. Due to the derived abnormal reddening law in this line of sight, both clusters appear much closer (to the Sun) than previously thought. % Additionally, we present the optical colors and magnitudes of the WR~48a star and its main parameters were estimated. The properties of the two embedded clusters DBS2003~130 and 131, are also addressed. We identify a number of Young Stellar Objects which are probable members of these clusters. This new material is then used to revisit the spiral structure in this sector of the Galaxy showing evidence of populations associated with the inner Galaxy Scutum-Crux arm.
astro-ph.GA:The emission of cold dust grains at long wavelengths will soon be observed by the Planck and Herschel satellites and provide new constraints on the nature of interstellar dust. The microwave anomalous emission, proposed to be due to spinning PAHs, should help to better define these species. Moreover, understanding the fluctuations of the anomalous emission over the sky is crucial for CMB studies. We focus on the long wavelength emission of interstellar PAHs in their rovibrational and rotational transitions. The PAH emission spectrum from the IR to the microwave range is presented and compared to anomalous emission observations. To model their long wavelength emission, we treat PAHs as isolated systems and follow consistently their IR and rotational emissions. We consider several interstellar phases and discuss how the anomalous emission may constrain their size distribution. Our model of PAH emission accounts for the mid-IR spectra of the diffuse interstellar medium and of the Orion Bar. For lambda<3mm the PAH IR emission does not scale any more with the radiation field intensity (Go) unlike the mid-IR part of the spectrum. This emission represents less than 10% of the total dust emission at 100 GHz. We find the broadband emissivity of spinning PAHs per carbon atom to be rather constant for Go<100 and nH<100cm-3. Observations of anomalous emission in the Perseus molecular cloud are explained by our model of spinning PAH emission with a standard abundance, supporting PAHs as the origin of the anomalous emission. The behaviour of the spinning dust emissivity with Go provides a clear test that can be tested against observations of anomalous and dust mid-IR emissions. Comparison of these emissions will provide constraints on the size and/or electric dipole moment of interstellar PAHs.
astro-ph.GA:We show that there is a low metallicity tidal stream that runs along l=143 deg. in the South Galactic Cap, about 34 kpc from the Sun, discovered from SEGUE stellar velocities. Since the most concentrated detections are in the Cetus constellation, and the orbital path is nearly polar, we name it the Cetus Polar Stream (CPS). Although it is spatially coincident with the Sgr dwarf trailing tidal tail at b=-70 deg., the metallicities ([Fe/H] = -2.1), ratio of blue straggler to blue horizontal branch stars, and velocities of the CPS stars differ from Sgr. Some CPS stars may contaminate previous samples of Sgr dwarf tidal debris. The unusual globular cluster NGC 5824 is located along an orbit fit to the CPS, with the correct radial velocity.
astro-ph.GA:We present GALEX far (FUV) and near (NUV) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearby early-type galaxies from the SAURON representative sample of 48 E/S0 galaxies, all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the MDM Observatory. The surface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue UV-optical colours suggesting recent star formation. Five of these show blue integrated UV-optical colours that set them aside in the NUV integrated colour-magnitude relation. They also have other properties confirming they have had recent star formation, in particular H_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescent population and a higher CO detection rate. NUV-blue galaxies are generally drawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical mass part of the sample. We have also constructed the first UV Fundamental Planes and show that NUV blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. If they are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virial theorem. Although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that a dominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the UV Fundamental Planes is due to the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies. Interestingly, the UV-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety of behaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, a central UV-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicity gradients, and in many cases a combination of these. In addition, FUV-NUV and FUV-V colours even bluer than those normally associated with UV-upturn galaxies are observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. Four out of the five UV-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. These objects should thus pose interesting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the UV-upturn.
astro-ph.GA:We present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity (Vesc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early type galaxies from the SAURON sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies with both detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling. Values of Vesc are computed using Multi Gaussian Expansion (MGE) photometric fitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic Jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneously on HST and ground-based images. We determine line strengths and escape velocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation of the correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. We find a tight correlation between Vesc and the line-strength indices. For Mgb we find that this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but also inside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. The relation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the global relation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsic scatter in the local gradients. We transform our line strength index measurements to the single stellar population (SSP) equivalent age (t), metallicity ([Z/H]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]) and carry out a principal component analysis of our SSP and Vesc data. We find that in this four-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a good approximation confined to a plane, given by $\log \mathrm({V}_{\mathrm{esc}}/500\mathrm{km/s}) = 0.85 \mathrm{[Z/H]} + 0.43 \log (\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{Gyrs})$ - 0.20. It is surprising that it is a combination of age and metallicity that is conserved; this may indicate a 'conspiracy' between age and metallicity or a weakness in the SSP models.
astro-ph.GA:We present VLA 1.3 cm radio continuum and water maser observations as well as SMA SO$_2$ (226.300 GHz) and 1.3 mm dust continuum observations toward the massive star formation region IRAS 16547-4247. We find evidence of multiple sources in the central part of the region. There is evidence of a rotating structure associated with the most massive of these sources, traced at small scales (~50 AU) by the water masers. At large scales (~1000 AU) we find a velocity gradient in the SO2 molecular emission with a barely resolved structure that can be modeled as a rotating ring or two separate objects. The velocity gradients of the masers and of the molecular emission have the same sense and may trace the same structure at different size scales. The position angles of the structures associated with the velocity gradients are roughly perpendicular to the outflow axis observed in radio continuum and several molecular tracers. We estimate the mass of the most massive central source to be around 30 solar masses from the velocity gradient in the water maser emission. The main source of error in this estimate is the radius of the rotating structure. We also find water masers that are associated with the large scale molecular outflow of the system, as well as water masers that are associated with other sources in the region. Our results suggest that the formation of this source, one of the most luminous protostars or protostellar clusters known, is taking place with the presence of ionized jets and disk-like structures.
astro-ph.GA:The galactic anomalous microwave emission detected between 10 and 90 GHz is a major foreground to CMB fluctuations. Well correlated to dust emission at 100 $\mu$m, the anomalous emission is interstellar but its origin is still debated. Some possible explanations relate it to dust: emission of spinning, small (nanometric) grains carrying a permanent electric dipole or magnetic fluctuations in larger (submicronic) grains. To probe the origin of the anomalous emission, we compare microwave data to dust IR emission and search for specific signatures predicted by models of spinning dust. For the anomalous emission, we use the 23 GHz all-sky map deduced from WMAP data by Miville-Deschenes et al. (2008). The dust emission is traced by IRAS data. Models show that spinning dust emission is little sensitive to the intensity of the radiation field (Go) for 10<nu<30 GHz while the corresponding mid-IR emission is proportional to Go. To test this behaviour in our comparison, we derive Go from the dust temperature maps of Schlegel et al. (1998). From all-sky maps, we show that the anomalous emission is better correlated to the emission of small grains (at 12 $\mu$m) than to that of big grains (at 100 $\mu$m). In addition we show that the former correlation is significantly improved when the 12 $\mu$m flux is divided by Go, as predicted by current models of spinning dust.
astro-ph.GA:We have collected all available spectra and photometric data from SDSS catalogue for bright AGNs complied from the first three months of the Fermi large area telescope all-sky survey. Based on the 106 high-confidence and 11 low-confidence association bright AGN list, the photometry data are collected from SDSS DR7 for 28 sources (12 BL Lacs and 16 FSRQs), two of which are low-confidence association bright AGNs. Among these 28 SDSS photometric sources, SDSS spectra are available for 20 sources (6 BL Lacs and 14 FSRQs). The black hole mass M_BH and the broad line region (BLR) luminosity were obtained for 14 FSRQs by measuring the line-width and strength of broad emission lines from SDSS spectra. The broad emission lines measurements of five FSRQs are presented for the first time in this work. The optical continuum emission of these 14 FSRQs is found to be likely dominated by the nonthermal jet emission through comparing the relationship between the broad Mg II line and continuum luminosity to that of radio quiet AGNs. The black hole mass of 14 FSRQs ranges from 10^8.2 to 10^9.9 solar mass, with most of sources larger than 10^9 solar mass. The Eddington ratio L_bol/L_Edd ranges from 10^-1.5 to ~ 1. This implies that the optically thin, geometrically thick accretion disk may exist in these FSRQs.
astro-ph.GA:The majority of galactic chemical evolution models assumes the instantaneous mixing approximation (IMA). This assumption is probably not realistic as indicated by the existence of chemical inhomogeneities, although current chemical evolution models of the Milky Way can reproduce the majority of the observational constraints under the IMA. The aim of this paper is to test whether relaxing this approximation in a detailed chemical evolution model can improve or worsen the agreement with observations. To do that, we investigated two possible causes for relaxing of the instantaneous mixing: i) the ``galactic fountain time delay effect'' and ii) the ``metal cooling time delay effect''. We found that the effect of galactic fountains is negligible if an average time delay of 0.1 Gyr, as suggested in a previous paper, is assumed. Longer time delays produce differences in the results but they are not realistic. We also found that the O abundance gradient in the disk is not affected by galactic fountains. The metal cooling time delays produce strong effects on the evolution of the chemical abundances only if we adopt stellar yields depending on metallicity. If instead, the yields computed for to the solar chemical composition are adopted, negligible effects are produced, as in the case of the galactic fountain delay. The relaxation of the IMA by means of the galactic fountain model, where the delay is considered only for massive stars and only in the disk, does not affect the chemical evolution results. The combination of metal dependent yields and time delay in the chemical enrichment from all stars starting from the halo phase, instead, produces results at variance with observations.
astro-ph.GA:The majority of stars form in clusters. Therefore a comprehensive view of star formation requires understanding the initial conditions for cluster formation. The goal of our study is to shed light on the physical properties of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and the role they play in the formation of stellar clusters. This article, the first of a series dedicated to the study of IRDCs, describes techniques developed to establish a complete catalogue of Spitzer IRDCs in the Galaxy. We have analysed Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL data to identify a complete sample of IRDCs in the region of Galactic longitude and latitude 10deg < |l|<65deg and |b|<1deg. From the 8micron observations we have constructed opacity maps and used a newly developed extraction algorithm to identify structures above a column density of N_{H2} > 1x10^{22} cm^{-2}. The 24micron data are then used to characterize the star formation activity of each extracted cloud. A total of 11303 clouds have been extracted. A comparison with the existing MSX based catalogue of IRDCs shows that 80% of these Spitzer dark clouds were previously unknown. The algorithm also extracts ~ 20000 to 50000 fragments within these clouds, depending on detection threshold used. A first look at the MIPSGAL data indicates that between 20% and 68% of these IRDCs show 24micron point-like association. This new database provides an important resource for future studies aiming to understand the initial conditions of star formation in the Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:The UV-Excess Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane images a 10x185 degree wide band, centered on the Galactic Equator using the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope in four bands (U,g,r,HeI5875) down to ~21st-22nd magnitude (~20th in HeI5875). The setup and data reduction procedures are described. Simulations of the colours of main-sequence stars, giant, supergiants, DA and DB white dwarfs and AM CVn stars are made, including the effects of reddening. A first look at the data of the survey (currently 30% complete) is given.
astro-ph.GA:We reveal the stellar light emerging from the kiloparsec-scale, ring-like structure of the NGC5128 (Centaurus A) galaxy in unprecedented detail. We use arcsecond-scale resolution near infrared images to create a "dust-free" view of the central region of the galaxy, which we then use to quantify the shape of the revealed structure. At the resolution of the data, the structure contains several hundreds of discreet, point-like or slightly elongated sources. Typical extinction corrected surface brightness of the structure is K_S = 16.5 mag/arcsec^2, and we estimate the total near infrared luminosity of the structure to be M = -21 mag. We use diffraction limited (FWHM resolution of ~ 0.1", or 1.6 pc) near infrared data taken with the NACO instrument on VLT to show that the structure decomposes into thousands of separate, mostly point-like sources. According to the tentative photometry, the most luminous sources have M_K = -12 mag, naming them red supergiants or relatively low-mass star clusters. We also discuss the large-scale geometry implied by the reddening signatures of dust in our near infrared images.
astro-ph.GA:The formation history of the Small Magellanic cloud (SMC) is unraveled based on the results of our new chemical evolution models constructed for the SMC, highlighting the observed anomaly in the age-metallicity relation for star clusters in the SMC. We first propose that evidence of a major merger is imprinted in the age-metallicity relation as a dip in [Fe/H]. Our models predict that the major merger with a mass ratio of 1:1 to 1:4 occurred at ~7.5 Gyr ago, with a good reproduction of the abundance distribution function of field stars in the SMC. Furthermore, our models predict a relatively large scatter in [Mg/Fe] for -1.4 < [Fe/H] <-1.1 as a reflection of a looping feature resulting from the temporally inverse progress of chemical enrichment, which can be tested against future observational results. Given that the observed velocity dispersion (~30 km/s) of the SMC is much smaller than that (~160 km/s) of the Galactic halo, our finding strongly implies that the predicted merger event happened in a small group environment that was far from the Galaxy and contained a number of small gas-rich dwarfs comparable to the SMC. This theoretical view is extensively discussed in the framework that considers a connection with the formation history of the Large Magellanic cloud.
astro-ph.GA:We find a significant anti-correlation between the hard X-ray photon index and the Eddington ratio L_Bol/L_Edd for a sample of Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions (LINERs) and local Seyfert galaxies, compiled from literatures with Chandra or XMM-Newton observations. This result is in contrast with the positive correlation found in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while it is similar to that of X-ray binaries (XRBs) in low/hard state. Our result is qualitatively consistent with the spectra produced from advection dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). It implies that the X-ray emission of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) may originate from the Comptonization process in ADAF, and the accretion process in LLAGNs may be similar to that of XRBs in the low/hard state, which is different from that in luminous AGNs.
astro-ph.GA:We have used the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA) to make deep N2H+ 1-0 maps of the pre-stellar core L183, in order to study the spatial and kinematic substructure within the densest part of the core. Three spatially and kinematically distinct clumps are detected, which we label L183-N1, L183-N2 and L183-N3. L183-N2 is approximately coincident with the submillimetre dust peak and lies at the systemic velocity of L183. Thus we conclude that L183-N2 is the central dense core of L183. L183-N1 and 3 are newly-discovered fragments of L183, which are marked by velocity gradients that are parallel to, but far stronger than, the velocity gradient of L183 as a whole, as detected in previous single-dish data. Furthermore, the ratio of the large-scale and small-scale velocity gradients, and the ratio of their respective size-scales, are consistent with the conservation of angular momentum for a rotating, collapsing core undergoing spin-up. The inferred axis of rotation is parallel to the magnetic field direction, which is offset from its long axis, as we have seen in other pre-stellar cores. Therefore, we propose that we have detected a fragmenting, collapsing, filamentary, pre-stellar core, rotating about its B-field, which is spinning up as it collapses. It will presumably go on to form a multiple protostellar system.
astro-ph.GA:I have used a newtonian infinite body problem to model a protoplanitary-like hot accretion disk and added terms of laminar and Stokes friction. Then I used qualitative methods to show the unstability of local regions leading to a lemma of radial migration and local unstability in hot, proto-planetary-like accretion disks. Then I considered a general infinite body problem with a position dependent, gravitation-like force and a general perturbating term.
astro-ph.GA:Very strong evidence suggests that Sagittarius A*, a compact radio source at the center of the Milky Way, marks the position of a super massive black hole. The proximity of Sgr A* in combination with its mass makes its apparent event horizon the largest of any black hole candidate in the universe and presents us with a unique opportunity to observe strong-field GR effects. Recent millimeter very long baseline interferometric observations of Sgr A* have demonstrated the existence of structures on scales comparable to the Schwarzschild radius. These observations already provide strong evidence in support of the existence of an event horizon. (Sub)Millimeter VLBI observations in the near future will combine the angular resolution necessary to identify the overall morphology of quiescent emission, such as an accretion disk or outflow, with a fine enough time resolution to detect possible periodicity in the variable component of emission. In the next few years, it may be possible to identify the spin of the black hole in Sgr A*, either by detecting the periodic signature of hot spots at the innermost stable circular orbit or parameter estimation in models of the quiescent emission. Longer term, a (sub)millimeter VLBI "Event Horizon Telescope" will be able to produce images of the Galactic center emission to the see the silhouette predicted by general relativistic lensing. These techniques are also applicable to the black hole in M87, where black hole spin may be key to understanding the jet-launching region.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the atomic (HI) and molecular (H_2) Hydrogen content of normal galaxies by combining observational studies linking galaxy stellar and gas budgets to their host dark matter (DM) properties, with a physically grounded galaxy formation model. This enables us to analyse empirical relationships between the virial, stellar, and gaseous masses of galaxies and explore their physical origins. Utilising a semi-analytic model (SAM) to study the evolution of baryonic material within evolving DM halos, we study the effects of baryonic infall and various star formation and feedback mechanisms on the properties of formed galaxies using the most up-to-date physical recipes. We find that in order to significantly improve agreement with observations of low-mass galaxies we must suppress the infall of baryonic material and exploit a two-phase interstellar medium (ISM), where the ratio of HI to H_2 is determined by the galactic disk structure. Modifying the standard Schmidt-Kennicutt star formation law, which acts upon the total cold gas in galaxy discs and includes a critical density threshold, and employing a star formation law which correlates with the H_2 gas mass results in a lower overall star formation rate. This in turn, allows us to simultaneously reproduce stellar, HI and H_2 mass functions of normal galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) This thesis presents long-term timing results on 20 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). It has been predicted that such timing may detect gravitational waves (GWs) - a major (but untested) prediction of general relativity. Our results demonstrate that most of the investigated MSPs have sufficient stability to enable such detection experiments. Furthermore, the timing data of the brightest few sources shows that timing at sub-100 ns precision may be achievable and that, therefore, GW detection within the next decade is likely. Finally, we use our data to place a strong limit on the strength of a predicted background of GWs.
astro-ph.GA:Clusters of stars are key objects for the study of the dynamical and chemical evolution of the Galaxy and its neighbors. In particular chemical composition is obtained from different kinds of stars (hot main-sequence stars, cool main-sequence stars, horizontal-branch stars, RGB stars) using different methodologies. Our aim is to apply these methodologies to the stars of the Open Cluster NGC 6475. Obtaining a census of the most important elements we will be able to test their consistence. We finally want to establish more robust fundamental parameters for this cluster.We selected high S/N high resolution spectra of 7 stars of the Open Cluster NGC 6475 from the ESO database covering the T$_{\rm eff}$ range 4500-10000 K and of luminosity class V (dwarf) and III (giants). We determined the chemical abundances of several elements. For hot stars (T$_{\rm eff}$$>$9000 K) we applied the Balmer Lines fitting method to obtained atmospheric parameters. For cool stars (T$_{\rm eff}$$<$6500 K) we used the FeI/II abundance equilibrium method. For the two groups of stars the use of different line-lists was mandatory. LTE approximation was used. For elements affected by NLTE deviation (C,N,O,Na,Mg) corrections were applied. The abundance of many elements were obtained from the measurement of the equivalent width of spectral lines. For those elements for which only blended lines were available (O, He) comparison of real spectrum with synthetic ones was used. Hyperfine structure was taken in account for V and Ba.
astro-ph.GA:We consider a gravitational field in steady state galaxy models of two kinds. Some of them are axisymmetrical and others are triaxial. Equipotentials and potential law are given separately in accordance to Kutuzov and Ossipkov (1980). The relatively simple potential law is based on Kuzmin-Malasidze model (1969). Two kinds of models contain four and five structural parameters respectively. One composite model is suggested as well. Some examples of trajectories are calculated in these models. The simplest method to describe orbits is drawing their projections on coordinate planes. However it needs a great amount of calculation and makes troubles in an interpretation of information. In the case of axisymmetrical models a motion in co-moving meridional plane (with cylindrical coordinates R, z) is considered as a common way. In the case of triaxial models one can use three different co-moving planes passing through moving star and corresponding coordinate axis. We describe models in sections 2-4, calculated orbits are discussed in section 5.
astro-ph.GA:Spiral galaxies are studied using a simple global disc model as a means for approximate determination of mass profiles. Based on rotation curves and the amount of gas (HI+He), we find global surface mass densities consistent with measurements and compare them with B-band surface brightness profiles. As a result we obtain mass-to-light ratio profiles. We give some arguments for why our approach is reliable and sometimes better than those assuming ad hoc the presence of a massive non-baryonic dark matter halo. Using this model, we study galaxies NGC 7793, 1365, 6946 and UGC 6446. Based on a rotation curve from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) we also study galaxy NGC 4536 and compare the results with those we published elsewhere for the same galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:We present N-body simulations of dissolving star clusters close to galactic centres. For this purpose, we developed a new N-body program called nbody6gc based on Aarseth's series of N-body codes. We describe the algorithm in detail. We report about the density wave phenomenon in the tidal arms which has been recently explained by Kuepper et al. (2008). Standing waves develop in the tidal arms. The wave knots or clumps develop at the position, where the emerging tidal arm hits the potential wall of the effective potential and is reflected. The escaping stars move through the wave knots further into the tidal arms. We show the consistency of the positions of the wave knots with the theory in Just et al. (2009). We also demonstrate a simple method to study the properties of tidal arms. By solving many eigenvalue problems along the tidal arms, we construct numerically a 1D coordinate system whose direction is always along a principal axis of the local tensor of inertia. Along this coordinate system, physical quantities can be evaluated. The half-mass or dissolution times of our models are almost independent of the particle number which indicates that two-body relaxation is not the dominant mechanism leading to the dissolution. This may be a typical situation for many young star clusters. We propose a classification scheme which sheds light on the dissolution mechanism.
astro-ph.GA:Ammonia inversion lines are often used as probes of the physical conditions in the dense ISM. The excitation temperature between the first two para metastable (rotational) levels is an excellent probe of the gas kinetic temperature. However, the calibration of this ammonia thermometer depends on the accuracy of the collisional rates with H2. Here we present new collisional rates for ortho-NH3 and para-NH3 colliding with para-H2 (J=0) and we investigate the effects of these new rates on the excitation of ammonia. Scattering calculations employ a new, high accuracy, potential energy surface computed at the coupled-cluster CCSD(T) level with a basis set extrapolation procedure. Rates are obtained for all transitions involving ammonia levels with J <= 3 and for kinetic temperatures in the range 5-100 K. We find that the calibration curve of the ammonia thermometer -- which relates the observed excitation temperature between the first two para metastable levels to the gas kinetic temperature -- does not change significantly when these new rates are used. Thus, the calibration of ammonia thermometer appears to be robust. Effects of the new rates on the excitation temperature of inversion and rotation-inversion transitions are also found to be small.
astro-ph.GA:Understanding the role of mergers in galaxy formation is one of the most outstanding problems in extragalactic astronomy. While we now have an idea for how the merger fraction evolves at redshifts z < 3, converting this merger fraction into merger rates, and therefore how many mergers an average galaxy undergoes during its history, is still uncertain. The main reason for this is that the inferred number of mergers depends highly upon the time-scale observational methods are sensitive for finding ongoing or past mergers. While there are several theoretical and model-based estimates of merger times, there is currently no empirical measure of this time-scale. We present the first observationally based measurement of merger times utilising the observed decline in the galaxy major merger fraction at z < 1.2 based on > 20,000 galaxies in the Extended Groth Strip and COSMOS surveys. Using a new methodology described in this paper, we determine how long a galaxy remains identifiable as a merging system within the CAS system. We find a maximum CAS major merger time-scale of 1.1+/-0.3 Gyr at z < 1.2, and a most likely CAS merger time-scale of 0.6+/-0.3 Gyr, in good agreement with results from N-body simulations. Utilizing this time-scale we measure the number of major mergers galaxies with masses M_{*} > 10^{10} M_0 undergo at z < 1.2, with a total number N_m = 0.90_{-0.23}^{+0.44}. We further show that this time-scale is inconsistent with a star formation origin for ultra-high asymmetries, thereby providing further evidence that structural methods are able to locate mostly merging galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:Future X-ray instrumentation is expected to allow us to significantly improve the constraints derivedfrom the Fe K lines in AGN, such as the black-hole angular momentum (spin) and the inclination angle of the putative accretion disk. We consider the possibility that measurements of the persistent, time-averaged Fe K line emission from the disk could be supplemented by the observation of a localized flare, or "hotspot", orbiting close to the black hole. Although observationally challenging, such measurements would recover some of the information loss that is inherent to the radially-integrated line profiles. We present calculations for this scenario to assess the extent to which, in principle, black-hole spin may be measured. We quantify the feasibility of this approach using realistic assumptions about likely measurement uncertainties.
astro-ph.GA:In this study one resorts to the phenomenology of models endowed with a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry, in order to develop a mechanism through which dynamics similar to that due to the presence of dark matter is generated. As a first attempt, one tries to account for the flattening of the galaxy rotation curves as an effect of the non-(covariant) conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of visible matter. Afterwards, one assumes instead that this non-minimal coupling modifies the scalar curvature in a way that can be interpreted as a dark matter component (albeit with negative pressure). It is concluded that it is possible to mimic known dark matter density profiles through an appropriate power-law coupling $f_2 = (R/R0)^n$, with a negative index $n$ -- a fact that reflects the dominance of dark matter at large distances. The properties of the model are extensively discussed, and possible cosmological implications are addressed.
astro-ph.GA:We discuss the observations and theory of star cluster formation to argue that clusters form dynamically cool (subvirial) and with substructure. We then perform an ensemble of simulations of cool, clumpy (fractal) clusters and show that they often dynamically mass segregate on timescales far shorter than expected from simple models. The mass segregation comes about through the production of a short-lived, but very dense core. This shows that in clusters like the Orion Nebula Cluster the stars >4 Msun can dynamically mass segregate within the current age of the cluster. Therefore, the observed mass segregation in apparently dynamically young clusters need not be primordial, but could be the result of rapid and violent early dynamical evolution.
astro-ph.GA:We present recent results on highly ionized gas in Galactic High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs), originally surveyed in OVI (Sembach et al. 2003). In a new FUSE/HST survey of SiII/III/IV (Shull et al. 2009) toward 37 AGN, we detected SiIII (lambda 1206.500 A) absorption with a sky coverage fraction 81 +/- 5% (61 HVCs along 30 of 37 high-latitude sight lines). The SiIII (lambda 1206.500 A) line is typically 4-5 times stronger than OVI (lambda 1031.926 A). The mean HVC column density of perhaps 10^19 cm^-2 of low-metallicity (0.1 - 0.2 Z_sun) ionized gas in the low halo. Recent determinations of HVC distances allow us to estimate a total reservoir of ~10^8 M_sun. Estimates of infall velocities indicate an infall rate of around 1 M_sun yr^-1, comparable to the replenishment rate for star formation in the disk. HVCs appear to be sheathed by intermediate-temperature gas (10^4.0 - 10^4.5 K) detectable in SiIII and SiIV, as well as hotter gas seen in OVI and other high ions. To prepare for HST observations of 10 HVC-selected sight lines with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), we compile FUSE/STIS spectra of these ions, plus FeIII, CIII, CIV, and SIV. Better constraints on the physical properties of HVC envelopes and careful treatment of HVC kinematics and infall rates should come from high-quality (S/N ~ 30-40) COS data.
astro-ph.GA:We present Spitzer images of the Taurus Complex (TC) and take advantage of the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the observations to characterize the diffuse IR emission across the cloud. This work highlights evidence of dust evolution within the translucent sections of the archetype reference for studies of quiescent molecular clouds. We combine Spitzer 160 um and IRAS 100 um observations to produce a dust temperature map and a far-IR dust opacity map at 5' resolution. The average dust temperature is about 14.5K with a dispersion of +/-1K across the cloud. The far-IR dust opacity is a factor 2 larger than the average value for the diffuse ISM. This opacity increase and the attenuation of the radiation field (RF) both contribute to account for the lower emission temperature of the large grains. The structure of the TC significantly changes in the mid-IR images that trace emission from PAHs and VSGs. We focus our analysis of the mid-IR emission to a range of ecliptic latitudes where the zodiacal light residuals are small. Within this cloud area, there are no 8 and 24 um counterparts to the brightest 160 um emission features. Conversely, the 8 and 24 um images reveal filamentary structure that is strikingly inconspicuous in the 160 um and extinction maps. The IR colors vary over sub-parsec distances across this filamentary structure. We compare the observed colors with model calculations quantifying the impact of the RF intensity and the abundance of stochastically heated particles on the dust SED. To match the range of observed colors, we have to invoke variations by a factor of a few of both the interstellar RF and the abundance of PAHs and VSGs. We conclude that within this filamentary structure a significant fraction of the dust mass cycles in and out the small size end of the dust size distribution.
astro-ph.GA:We report ~100 pc (0.3") resolution observations of (sub)millimeter HCO+ and CO lines in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220. The lines peak at two merger nuclei, with HCO+ being more spatially concentrated than CO. Asymmetric line profiles with blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission are discovered in HCO+(3-2) and (4-3) toward the two nuclei and in CO(3-2) toward one nucleus. We suggest that these P-Cygni profiles are due to ~100 km/s outward motion of molecular gas from the nuclei. This gas is most likely outflowing from the inner regions of the two nuclear disks rotating around individual nuclei, clearing the shroud around the luminosity sources there.
astro-ph.GA:We measure the Ca II 8542 line strength in 3360 stars along three lines-of-sight in the Galactic bar: (l,b) ~ (+/-5.0,-3.5) and Baade's Window, using Fabry-Perot (FP) absorption line spectroscopy. This is the first attempt to show that reliable absorption line strengths can be measured using FP spectroscopy. The Ca II 8542 line is a good indicator of metallicity and its calibration to [Fe/H] is determined for globular cluster red giants in previous investigations. We derive such a calibration for the bulge giants and use it to infer metallicities for our full red clump sample (2488 stars) at all three lines-of-sight. We present the stellar metallicity distributions along the major axis of the bar. We find the mean [Fe/H] = -0.09 +/- 0.04 dex in Baade's Window, and find the distribution in this field to agree well with previous works. We find gradients in the mean metallicity and its dispersion w.r.t Baade's WIndow of -0.45 and -0.20 dex respectively at l = +5.5, and of -0.10 dex and -0.20 dex at l = -5.0. We detect a signature of a possible tidal stream at l = +5.5, in both our velocity and metallicity distributions. Its radial velocity indicates that it is not associated with the Sagittarius stream. We also measure the metallicity of a bulge globular cluster NGC 6522 in our Baade's Window field to be -0.90 +/- 0.10 dex, in agreement with recent measurements of Zoccali et al. (2008). This agreement demonstrates the reliability of our metallicity measurements.
astro-ph.GA:Star formation is slow, in the sense that the gas consumption time is much longer than the dynamical time. It is also inefficient; essentially all star formation in local galaxies takes place in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), but the fraction of a GMC converted to stars is very small, ~5%. In the most luminous starbursts, the GMC lifetime is shorter than the main sequence lifetime of even the most massive stars, so that supernovae can play no role in GMC disruption. We investigate the disruption of GMCs across a wide range of galaxies, from normal spirals to the densest starbursts; we take into account the effects of HII gas pressure, shocked stellar winds, protostellar jets, and radiation pressure produced by the absorption and scattering of starlight on dust grains. In the Milky Way, we find that a combination of three mechanisms, jets, HII gas pressure, and radiation pressure, disrupts the clouds. In more rapidly star forming galaxies such as ``clump'' galaxies at high-redshift, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and submillimeter galaxies, radiation pressure dominates natal cloud distribution. We predict the presence of 10-20 clusters with masses ~10^7 Msun in local ULIRGs such as Arp 220 and a similar number of clusters with M_* ~ 10^8 Msun in high redshift clump galaxies; submillimeter galaxies will have even more massive clusters. We find that the mass fraction of a GMC that ends up in stars is an increasing function of the gas surface density of a galaxy, reaching ~35% in the most luminous starbursts. Furthermore, the disruption of bubbles by radiation pressure stirs the interstellar medium to velocities of ~10 km/s in normal galaxies and to ~100 km/s in ULIRGs like Arp 220, consistent with observations. Thus, radiation pressure may play a dominant role in the ISM of star-forming galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:We present new high resolution numerical simulations of the ISM in a central R ~32 parsecs region around a supermassive black hole at a galactic center. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of the ISM (Wada & Norman 2002) with the nuclear starburst now includes tracking of the formation of molecular hydrogen out of the neutral hydrogen phase. In a quasi equilibrium state, mass fraction of H2 is about 0.4 (total H2 mass is ~1.5 10^6 Msun) of the total gas mass for the uniform far UV (FUV) with G_0 = 10. The gas forms an inhomogeneous disk, whose scale-height becomes larger in the outer region. H2 forms a thin nuclear disk in the inner ~ 5 pc, which is surrounded by molecular clouds swelled up toward h < 10 pc. The velocity field of the disk is highly turbulent in the torus region, whose velocity dispersion is ~ 20 km/s on average. Average supernova rate (SNR) of ~ 5 10^-5/yr is large enough to energize these structures. Gas column densities toward the nucleus larger than 10^22 cm^-2 are observed if the viewing angle is smaller than \theta_v ~ 50 deg from the edge-on. However, the column densities are distributed over almost two orders of magnitude around the average for any given viewing angle due to the clumpy nature of the torus. For a stronger FUV (G_0 =100), the total H2 mass in an equillibrium is only slightly smaller (~ 0.35). Finally the morphology and kinematics of the circumnuclear molecular gas disks emerging from our models is similar to that revealed by recent near infrared observations using VLTI/Keck.
astro-ph.GA:The goal of the present paper is to investigate the circumstellar material around the brightest dust-enshrouded sources in the central stellar cluster of the Milky Way. Observations have been carried out at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope on Paranal, Chile. We have used the long wavelength (LWS3) low resolution (LR) spectroscopic mode of the ISAAC camera at the VLT in the spectral range of the M filter from 4.4micron to 5.1micron. The use of a slit width of 0.6" implied a spectral resolution of R=l/Dl=800 (Dv=375 km/s). These observations resulted in M-band spectra of 15 bright sources in the central stellar cluster of the Milky Way. In addition to gaseous 12^CO (4.666 micron) and 13^CO (4.77 micron) vibration-rotational absorptions, we detect a strong absorption due to a mixture of polar and apolar CO ice (centered at 4.675 micron). In the shorter wavelength absorption wing there is an absorption feature due to XCN at 4.62 micron. The XCN absorption is strongest toward the M2 supergiant IRS7. We find that the extinctions due to material traced by the CO ice and the CO gas absorptions may be of comparable importance. Using the spectra of IRS2L and IRS16C we perform a first order correction of the line of sight absorption due to CO-ice and 13^CO gas. In combination with published hydrogen number density estimates from sub-mm CO(7-6) and FIR [OI] line data we obtain gas masses of the circumstellar shells of the order of 10^-3 and 10^-2 solar masses. This implies that in future spectra taken at high spectral and angular resolution the bright and dust embedded Galactic Center sources should show a substantial line absorption due to source intrinsic absorption.
astro-ph.GA:We have carried out a search for radio emission at 820 MHz from six X-ray dim isolated neutron stars with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Radio Telescope. No transient or pulsed emission was found using fast folding, fast Fourier transform, and single-pulse searches. The corresponding flux limits are about 0.01 mJy for pulsed emission, depending on the integration time for the particular source and assuming a duty cycle of 2%, and 20 mJy for single dispersed pulses. These are the most sensitive limits to date on radio emission from X-ray dim isolated neutron stars. There is no evidence for isolated radio pulses, as seen in a class of neutron stars known as rotating radio transients. Our results imply that either the radio luminosities of these objects are lower than those of any known radio pulsars, or they could simply be long-period nearby radio pulsars with high magnetic fields beaming away from the Earth. To test the latter possibility, we would need around 40 similar sources to provide a 1 sigma probability of at least one of them beaming toward us. We also give a detailed description of our implementation of the Fast Folding Algorithm.
astro-ph.GA:Chemical abundances of 26 metal-poor dwarfs and giants are determined from high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with Subaru/HDS. The sample is selected so that most of the objects have outer-halo kinematics. Self-consistent atmospheric parameters were determined by an iterative procedure based on spectroscopic analysis. Abundances of 13 elements, including $\alpha$-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), odd-Z light elements (Na, Sc), iron-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn) and neutron-capture elements (Y, Ba), are determined by two independent data reduction and LTE analysis procedures, confirming the consistency of the stellar parameters and abundances results. We find a decreasing trend of [$\alpha$/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] for the range of $-3.5 <$ [Fe/H]$ < -1$, as found by Stephens and Boesgaard (2002). [Zn/Fe] values of most objects in our sample are slightly lower than the bulk of halo stars previously studied. These results are discussed as possible chemical properties of the outer halo in the Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:The synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models and External Compton (EC) models of AGN jets with continually longitudinal and transverse bulk velocity structures are constructed. The observed spectra show complex and interesting patterns in different velocity structures and viewing angles. These models are used to calculate the synchrotron and inverse Compton spectra of two typical BL Lac objects (BLO) (Mrk 421 and 0716+714) and one Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) (3c 279), and to discuss the implications of jet bulk velocity structures in unification of the BLO and FR I radio galaxies (FRI). By calculating the synchrotron spectra and SSC spectra of BL Lac object jets with continually bulk velocity structures, we find that the spectra are much different from ones in jets with uniform velocity structure under the increase of viewing angles. The unification of BLO and FRI is less constrained by viewing angles and would be imprinted by velocity structures intrinsic to the jet themselves. By considering the jets with bulk velocity structures constrained by apparent speed, we discuss the velocity structures imprinted on the observed spectra for different viewing angles. We find that the spectra are greatly impacted by longitudinal velocity structures, becasue the volume elements are compressed or expanded. Finally, we present the EC spectra of FSRQs and FR II radio galaxies (FRII) and find that they are weakly affected by velocity structures compared to synchrotron and SSC spectra.
astro-ph.GA:We study the properties of low-column density gas clumps in the halo of the Milky Way based on high-resolution 21-cm observations.   Using interferometric data from the WSRT and the VLA we study HI emission at low-, intermediate- and high radial velocities along four lines of sight towards quasars. Along these sightlines we previously detected weak CaII and NaI absorbers in their optical spectra.   The analysis of the high-resolution HI data reveals the presence of several compact and cold clumps of neutral gas at velocities similar to the optical absorption. The clumps have narrow HI line widths in the range of 1.8 to 13 km/s, yielding upper limits for the kinetic temperature of the gas of 70 to 3700 K. The neutral gas has low HI column densities in the range of 5E18 to 3E19 1/cm^2. All clumps have angular sizes of only a few arcminutes.   Our high-resolution 21-cm observations indicate that many of the CaII and NaI absorbers seen in our optical quasar spectra are associated with low-column density HI clumps at small angular scales. This suggests that next to the massive, high-column density neutral gas clouds in the halo (the common 21-cm LVCs, IVCs, and HVCs) there exists a population of low-mass, neutral gas structures in the halo that remain mostly unseen in the existing 21-cm all-sky surveys of IVCs and HVCs. The estimated thermal gas pressures of the detected HI clumps are consistent with what is expected from theoretical models of gas in the inner and outer Milky Way halo.
astro-ph.GA:Unlike gas-phase reactions, chemical reactions taking place on interstellar dust grain surfaces cannot always be modeled by rate equations. Due to the small grain sizes and low flux,these reactions may exhibit large fluctuations and thus require stochastic methods such as the moment equations.   We evaluate the formation rates of H2, HD and D2 molecules on dust grain surfaces and their abundances in the gas phase under interstellar conditions. We incorporate the moment equations into the Meudon PDR code and compare the results with those obtained from the rate equations. We find that within the experimental constraints on the energy barriers for diffusion and desorption and for the density of adsorption sites on the grain surface, H2, HD and D2 molecules can be formed efficiently on dust grains.   Under a broad range of conditions, the moment equation results coincide with those obtained from the rate equations. However, in a range of relatively high grain temperatures, there are significant deviations. In this range, the rate equations fail while the moment equations provide accurate results. The incorporation of the moment equations into the PDR code can be extended to other reactions taking place on grain surfaces.
astro-ph.GA:We describe a technique that finds orbits through the Galaxy that are consistent with measurements of a tidal stream, taking into account the extent that tidal streams do not precisely delineate orbits. We show that if accurate line-of-sight velocities are measured along a well defined stream, the technique recovers the underlying orbit through the Galaxy and predicts the distances and proper motions along the stream to high precision. As the error bars on the location and velocities of the stream grow, the technique is able to find more and more orbits that are consistent with the data and the uncertainties in the predicted distances and proper motions increase. With radial-velocity data along a stream ~40deg long and <0.3deg wide on the sky accurate to ~1 km/s the precisions of the distances and tangential velocities along the stream are 4 percent and 5 km/s, respectively. The technique can be used to diagnose the Galactic potential: if circular-speed curve is actually flat, both a Keplerian potential and Phi(r) proportional to r are readily excluded. Given the correct radial density profile for the dark halo, the halo's mass can be determined to a precision of 5 percent.
astro-ph.GA:[abridged] Our knowledge of the inner structure of embedded massive young stellar objects is still quite limited. We attempt here to overcome the spatial resolution limitations of conventional thermal infrared imaging. We employed mid-infrared interferometry using the MIDI instrument on the ESO/VLTI facility to investigate M8E-IR, a well-known massive young stellar object suspected of containing a circumstellar disk. Spectrally dispersed visibilities in the 8-13 micron range were obtained at seven interferometric baselines. We resolve the mid-infrared emission of M8E-IR and find typical sizes of the emission regions of the order of 30 milli-arcseconds (~45 AU). Radiative transfer simulations have been performed to interpret the data. The fitting of the spectral energy distribution, in combination with the measured visibilities, does not provide evidence for an extended circumstellar disk with sizes > 100 AU but requires the presence of an extended envelope. The data are not able to constrain the presence of a small-scale disk in addition to an envelope. In either case, the interferometry measurements indicate the existence of a strongly bloated, relatively cool central object, possibly tracing the recent accretion history of M8E-IR. In addition, we present 24.5 micron images that clearly distinguish between M8E-IR and the neighbouring ultracompact HII region and which show the cometary-shaped infrared morphology of the latter source. Our results show that IR interferometry, combined with radiative transfer modelling, can be a viable tool to reveal crucial structure information on embedded massive young stellar objects and to resolve ambiguities arising from fitting the SED.
astro-ph.GA:The cosmic-ray propagation code GALPROP has recently been enhanced in the areas of Galactic magnetic field and synchrotron radiation. A full 3D treatment is now implemented. We describe these enhancements and show applications to the interpretation of non-thermal radio surveys and gamma rays, to probe the Galactic cosmic-ray electron spectrum and magnetic fields.
astro-ph.GA:Using the MSX mid-infrared observation, we reveal a 100 pc-scale superbubble surrounding the giant HII region NGC3603. We suggest that the diffuse surrounding infrared emission in bands A, C, and D is dominated by that of PAH and the emission in band E is dominated by that of dust grains. The fitted dust temperature is consistent with the heating by the central cluster's UV photons. The derived gas-to-dust mass ratio for the bubble shell is of order 10^2.
astro-ph.GA:Recent measurements of the Zeeman effect in dark-cloud cores provide important tests for theories of cloud dynamics and prestellar core formation. In this Letter we report results of simulated Zeeman measurements, based on radiative transfer calculations through a snapshot of a simulation of supersonic and super-Alfv\'enic turbulence. We have previously shown that the same simulation yields a relative mass-to-flux ratio (core versus envelope) in agreement with the observations (and in contradiction with the ambipolar-drift model of core formation). Here we show that the mass-to-flux and turbulent-to-magnetic-energy ratios in the simulated cores agree with observed values as well. The mean magnetic field strength in the simulation is very low, \bar{B}=0.34 \muG, presumably lower than the mean field in molecular clouds. Nonetheless, high magnetic field values are found in dense cores, in agreement with the observations (the rms field, amplified by the turbulence, is B_{rms}=3.05 \muG). We conclude that a strong large-scale mean magnetic field is not required by Zeeman effect measurements to date, although it is not ruled out by this work.
astro-ph.GA:Context. Spitzer Space Telescope observations and dust emission models are used to discuss the distribution of dust and its characteristics in M31. Together with GALEX FUV, NUV, and SDSS images we studied the age dependence of the dust heating process. Methods.Spitzer IRAC/MIPS maps of M31 were matched together and compared to dust emission models allowing to constrain the dust mass, the intensity of the mean radiation field, the abundance of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) particles. The total infrared emission (TIR) was analyzed in function of UV and Optical colors and compared to predictions of models which consider the age-dependent dust heating. Results. We demonstrate that cold-dust component emission dominates the infrared spectral energy distribution of M31. The mean intensity of the radiation field heating the dust is low (typically U<2, where U=1 is the value in the solar surrounding). Due to the lack of submillimetric measurements the dust mass (M_{dust}) is only weakly constrained by the infrared spectrum. We show that across the spiral-ring structure of M31 a fraction >3% of the total dust mass is in PAHs. UV and optical colors are correlated to (TIR/FUV) ratios in \sim 670 pc-sized regions overall the disk of M31, although deviating from the IRX-beta relationship for starburst galaxies. We derived that in 83% of the regions analyzed across the 10kpc ring more than 50% of the energy absorbed by the dust is rediated at \lambda > 4000 \AA and that dust in M31 appears mainly heated by populations a few Gyr old even across the star-forming ring. The attenuation is varying radially peaking near 10kpc and decreasing faster in the inner regions of M31 than in the outer regions. We finally derived the attenuation map of M31 at 6"/px resolution (\sim 100 pc/px along the plane of M31).[abridged]
astro-ph.GA:The coalescence of a massive black hole (MBH) binary leads to the gravitational-wave recoil of the system and its ejection from the galaxy core. We have carried out N-body simulations of the motion of a MBH = 3.7x10^6 Msun MBH remnant in the Via Lactea I simulation, a Milky Way sized dark matter halo. The black hole receives a recoil velocity of Vkick = 80, 120, 200, 300, and 400 km/s at redshift 1.5, and its orbit is followed for over 1 Gyr within a live host halo, subject only to gravity and dynamical friction against the dark matter background. We show that, owing to asphericities in the dark matter potential, the orbit of the MBH is hightly non-radial, resulting in a significantly increased decay timescale compared to a spherical halo. The simulations are used to construct a semi-analytic model of the motion of the MBH in a time-varying triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo plus a spherical stellar bulge, where the dynamical friction force is calculated directly from the velocity dispersion tensor. Such a model should offer a realistic picture of the dynamics of kicked MBHs in situations where gas drag, friction by disk stars, and the flattening of the central cusp by the returning black hole are all negligible effects. We find that MBHs ejected with initial recoil velocities Vkick > 500 km/s do not return to the host center within Hubble time. In a Milky Way-sized galaxy, a recoiling hole carrying a gaseous disk of initial mass ~MBH may shine as a quasar for a substantial fraction of its wandering phase. The long decay timescales of kicked MBHs predicted by this study may thus be favorable to the detection of off-nuclear quasar activity.
astro-ph.GA:A large number of carbon-rich evolved objects (asymptotic giant branch stars, protoplanetary nebulae, and planetary nebulae) in both the Milky Way galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds exhibit an enigmatic broad emission feature at 30 micron. This feature, extending from 24 micron to 45 micron, is very strong and accounts for up to 30% of the total infrared luminosity of the object. In literature it is tentatively attributed to magnesium sulfide (MgS) dust. Using the prototypical protoplanetary nebula around HD 56126 for illustrative purpose, however, in this work we show that in order for MgS to be responsible for the 30 micron feature, one would require an amount of MgS mass substantially exceeding what would be available in this source. We therefore argue that MgS is unlikely the carrier of the 30 micron feature seen in this source and in other sources as well.
astro-ph.GA:We determine photometric metal abundance estimates for individual main-sequence stars in the Virgo Overdensity (VOD), which covers almost 1000 deg^2 on the sky, based on a calibration of the metallicity sensitivity of stellar isochrones in the gri filter passbands using field stars with well-determined spectroscopic metal abundances. Despite the low precision of the method for individual stars, we derive [Fe/H] = -2.0 +/-0.1 (internal) +/-0.5 (systematic) for the metal abundance of the VOD from photometric measurements of 0.7 million stars in the Northern Galactic hemisphere with heliocentric distances from ~10 kpc to ~20 kpc. The metallicity of the VOD is indistinguishable, within Delta [Fe/H] < 0.2, from that of field halo stars covering the same distance range. This initial application suggests that the SDSS gri passbands can be used to probe the properties of main-sequence stars beyond ~10 kpc, complementing studies of nearby stars from more metallicity-sensitive color indices that involve the u passband.
astro-ph.GA:We provide evidence that indicate the star cluster Pfleiderer 2, which is projected in a rich field, as a newly identified Galactic globular cluster. Since it is located in a crowded field, core extraction and decontamination tools were applied to reveal the cluster sequences in B, V and I Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs). The main CMD features of Pfleiderer 2 are a tilted Red Giant Branch, and a red Horizontal Branch, indicating a high metallicity around solar. The reddening is E(B-V)=1.01. The globular cluster is located at a distance from the Sun d$_{\odot}$ = 16$\pm$2 kpc.   The cluster is located at 2.7 kpc above the Galactic plane and at a distance from the Galactic center of R$_{\rm GC}$=9.7 kpc, which is unusual for a metal-rich globular cluster.
astro-ph.GA:We present absolute proper motions in Kapteyn Selected Area (SA) 103. This field is located 7 degrees west of the center of the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS, Duffau et al. 2006), and has a well-defined main sequence representing the stream. In SA 103 we identify one RR Lyrae star as a member of the VSS according to its metallicity, radial velocity and distance. VSS candidate turnoff stars and subgiant stars have proper motions consistent with that of the RR Lyrae star. The 3D velocity data imply an orbit with a pericenter of 11 kpc and an apocenter of ~90 kpc. Thus, the VSS comprises tidal debris found near the pericenter of a highly destructive orbit. Examining the six globular clusters at distances larger than 50 kpc from the Galactic center, and the proposed orbit of the VSS, we find one tentative association, NGC 2419. We speculate that NGC 2419 is possibly the nucleus of a disrupted system of which the VSS is a part.
astro-ph.GA:Using Spitzer/IRAC observations of a region to be observed by the CoRoT satellite, we have unraveled a new complex star-forming region at low metallicity in the outer Galaxy. We perform a study of S284 in order to outline the chain of events in this star-forming region. We used four-band Spitzer/IRAC photometry as well as Halpha imaging obtained with INT/WFC. Combining these data with the optical photometry obtained in the frame of CoRoTs preparation and the 2MASS catalog we analysed the properties and distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs) associated with point-like sources. We also studied the SEDs of regions of extended emission, complementing our dataset with IRAS and MSX data. We find that S284 is unique in several ways: it is very isolated at the end of a spiral arm and both the diffuse dust and ionized emission are remarkably symmetric. We have partially resolved the central clusters of the three bubbles present in this region. Despite the different scales present in its multiple-bubble morphology, our study points to a very narrow spread of ages among the powering high-mass clusters. In contrast, the particular sawtooth structure of the extended emission at the rim of each ionized bubble harbours either small lower-mass clusters with a younger stellar population or individual young reddened protostars. In particular, triggered star formation is considered to be at work in these regions.
astro-ph.GA:We have used the new 90GHz MUSTANG camera on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to map the bright Huygens region of the star-forming region M42 with a resolution of 9" and a sensitivity of 2.8mJy/beam. 90GHz is an interesting transition frequency, as MUSTANG detects both the free-free emission characteristic of the HII region created by the Trapezium stars, normally seen at lower frequencies, and thermal dust emission from the background OMC1 molecular cloud, normally mapped at higher frequencies. We also present similar data from the 150GHz GISMO camera taken on the IRAM telescope. This map has 15" resolution. By combining the MUSTANG data with 1.4, 8, and 21GHz radio data from the VLA and GBT, we derive a new estimate of the emission measure (EM) averaged electron temperature of Te = 11376K by an original method relating free-free emission intensities at optically thin and optically thick frequencies. Combining ISO-LWS data with our data, we derive a new estimate of the dust temperature and spectral emissivity index within the 80" ISO-LWS beam toward OrionKL/BN, Td = 42K and Beta=1.3. We show that both Td and Beta decrease when going from the HII region and excited OMC1 interface to the denser UV shielded part of OMC1 (OrionKL/BN, Orion S). With a model consisting of only free-free and thermal dust emission we are able to fit data taken at frequencies from 1.5GHz to 854GHz.
astro-ph.GA:In this paper we re-analyse the amplification process of broadband continuum radiation by astronomical masers in one-dimensional case. The basic equations appropriate for the scalar maser and the random nature of the maser radiation field are derived from basic physical principles. Comparision with the standard radiation transfer equation allows us to examine the underlying assumptions involved in the current theory of astronomical masers. Simulations are carried out to follow the amplification of different realisations of the broadband background radiation by the maser. The observable quantities such as intensity, spectral line profile are obtained by averaging over an ensemble of the emerging radiation corresponding to the amplified background radiation field. Our simulations show that the fluctuations of the radiation field inside the astronomical maser deviates significantly from Gaussian statistics even when the maser is only partially saturated. Coupling between different frequency modes and the population pulsing are shown to have increasing importance in the transport of maser radiation as the maser approaches saturation. Our results suggest that the standard formulation of radiation transfer provides a satisfactory description of the intensity and the line narrowing effect in the unsaturated and partially saturated masers within the framework of one-dimensional model. Howerver, the application of the same formulation to the strong saturation regime should be considered with caution.
astro-ph.GA:In this paper we investigate the polarization property of the radiation amplified by astronomical masers in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Our model explicitly takes into account the broadband nature of the radiation field and the interaction of the radiation with the maser transition J=1--0. The amplification of different realisations of the background continuum radition by the maser is directly simulated and the Stokes parameters of the radiation field are then obtained by averaging over the ensemble of emerging maser radiation. For isotropic pumping and partially saturated masers we find that the maser radiation is linearly polarized in two representative cases where the magnetic field {\bf B} makes an angle $\theta$=30$^0$ and $\theta$=90$^0$ to the maser axis. The linear polarization for maser radiation obtained in our simulations for both cases are in agreement with the results of the standard model. Furthermore, no instability during amplification is seen in our simulations. Therefore, we conclude that there is no problem with the previous numerical investigations of maser polarization in the unsaturated and partially saturated regime.
astro-ph.GA:Surface brightness fluctuations have been proved to be a very powerful technique to determine the distance and characterize the stellar content in extragalactic systems. Nevertheless, before facing the problem of stellar content in distant galaxies, we need to calibrate the method onto nearby well-known systems. In this paper we analyze the properties at $J$ and $K_s$ bands of a sample of 19 star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), for which accurate near-infrared (NIR) resolved star photometry, and integrated photometry are available. For the same sample, we derive the SBF measurements in $J$ and $K_s$-bands. We use the multi-purpose stellar population code \emph{SPoT (Stellar POpulations Tools)} to simulate the color-magnitude diagram, stellar counts, integrated magnitudes, colors, and surface brightness fluctuations of each cluster. The present procedure allows us to estimate the age and metallicity of the clusters in a consistent way, and provides a new calibration of the empirical $s$-parameter. We take advantage of the high sensitivity of NIR surface brightness fluctuations to thermally pulsing asymptotic (TP-AGB) stars to test different mass-loss rates affecting the evolution of such stars. We argue that NIR-SBFs can contribute to the disentangling of the observable properties of TP-AGB stars, especially in galaxies, where a large number of these stars are present.
astro-ph.GA:We present the first high-spatial resolution near-infrared (NIR) imaging of NGC 604, obtained with the NICMOS camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These NICMOS broadband images reveal new NIR point sources, clusters, and diffuse structures. We found an excellent spatial correlation between the 8.4 GHz radio continuum and the 2.2mu-m nebular emission. Moreover, massive young stellar object candidates appear aligned with these radio peaks, reinforcing the idea that those areas are star-forming regions. Three different scaled OB associations are recognized in the NICMOS images. The brightest NIR sources in our images have properties that suggest that they are red supergiant stars, of which one of them was previously known. This preliminary analysis of the NICMOS images shows the complexity of the stellar content of the NGC 604 nebula.
astro-ph.GA:Observations of Lynds Dark Nebula 1221 from the Spitzer Space Telescope are presented. These data show three candidate protostars towards L1221, only two of which were previously known. The infrared observations also show signatures of outflowing material, an interpretation which is also supported by radio observations with the Very Large Array. In addition, molecular line maps from the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory are shown.   One-dimensional dust continuum modelling of two of these protostars, IRS1 and IRS3, is described. These models show two distinctly different protostars forming in very similar environments. IRS1 shows a higher luminosity and larger inner radius of the envelope than IRS3. The disparity could be caused by a difference in age or mass, orientation of outflow cavities, or the impact of a binary in the IRS1 core.
astro-ph.GA:This paper is the second in a series, implementing a classification system for Gaia observations of unresolved galaxies. Our goals are to determine spectral classes and estimate intrinsic astrophysical parameters via synthetic templates. Here we describe (1) a new extended library of synthetic galaxy spectra, (2) its comparison with various observations, and (3) first results of classification and parametrization experiments using simulated Gaia spectrophotometry of this library. Using the PEGASE.2 code, based on galaxy evolution models that take account of metallicity evolution, extinction correction, and emission lines (with stellar spectra based on the BaSeL library), we improved our first library and extended it to cover the domain of most of the SDSS catalogue. We produce an extended library of 28885 synthetic galaxy spectra at zero redshift covering four general Hubble types of galaxies, over the wavelength range between 250 and 1050 nm at a sampling of 1 nm or less. The library is also produced for 4 random values of redshift in the range of 0-0.2. It is computed on a random grid of four key astrophysical parameters (infall timescale and 3 parameters defining the SFR) and, depending on the galaxy type, on two values of the age of the galaxy. The synthetic library was compared and found to be in good agreement with various observations. The first results from the SVM classifiers and parametrizers are promising, indicating that Hubble types can be reliably predicted and several parameters estimated with low bias and variance.
astro-ph.GA:We present optical and mid-infrared photometry of a statistically complete sample of 29 very faint dwarf galaxies (M_r > -15 mag) selected from the SDSS spectroscopic sample and observed in the mid-infrared with Spitzer IRAC. This sample contains nearby (redshift z<0.005) galaxies three magnitudes fainter than previously studied samples. We compare our sample with other star-forming galaxies that have been observed with both IRAC and SDSS. We examine the relationship of the infrared color, sensitive to PAH abundance, with star-formation rates, gas-phase metallicities and radiation hardness, all estimated from optical emission lines. Consistent with studies of more luminous dwarfs, we find that the very faint dwarf galaxies show much weaker PAH emission than more luminous galaxies with similar specific star-formation rates. Unlike more luminous galaxies, we find that the very faint dwarf galaxies show no significant dependence at all of PAH emission on star-formation rate, metallicity, or radiation hardness, despite the fact that the sample spans a significant range in all of these quantities. When the very faint dwarfs in our sample are compared with more luminous (M_r ~ -18 mag) dwarfs, we find that PAH emission depends on metallicity and radiation hardness. These two parameters are correlated; we look at the PAH-metallicity relation at fixed radiation hardness and the PAH-hardness relation at fixed metallicity. This test shows that the PAH emission in dwarf galaxies depends most directly on metallicity.
astro-ph.GA:We examine the chemical and dynamical structure in the solar neighbourhood of a model Galaxy that is the endpoint of a simulation of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way in the presence of radial mixing of stars and gas. Although the simulation's star-formation rate declines monotonically from its unique peak and no merger or tidal event ever takes place, the model replicates all known properties of a thick disc, as well as matching special features of the local stellar population such as a metal-poor extension of the thin disc that has high rotational velocity. We divide the disc by chemistry and relate this dissection to observationally more convenient kinematic selection criteria. We conclude that the observed chemistry of the Galactic disc does not provide convincing evidence for a violent origin of the thick disc, as has been widely claimed.
astro-ph.GA:We present a catalog of 5184 candidate infrared counterparts to X-ray sources detected towards the Galactic center. The X-ray sample contains 9017 point sources detected in this region by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, including data from a recent deep survey of the central 2 x 0.8 deg of the Galactic plane. A total of 6760 of these sources have hard X-ray colors, and the majority of them lie near the Galactic center, while most of the remaining 2257 soft X-ray sources lie in the foreground. We cross-correlated the X-ray source positions with the 2MASS and SIRIUS near-infrared catalogs, which collectively contain stars with a 10-sigma limiting flux of K_s<=15.6 mag. In order to distinguish absorbed infrared sources near the Galactic center from those in the foreground, we defined red and blue sources as those which have H-K_s>=0.9 and <=0.9 mag, respectively. We find that 5.8(1.5)% of the hard X-ray sources have real infrared counterparts, of which 228(99) are red and 166(27) are blue. The red counterparts are probably comprised of WR/O stars, HMXBs, and symbiotics near the Galactic center. We also find that 39.4(1.0)% of the soft X-ray sources have blue infrared counterparts; most of these are probably coronally active dwarfs in the foreground. There is a noteworthy collection of ~20 red counterparts to hard X-ray sources near the Sagittarius-B H II region, which are probably massive binaries that have formed within the last several Myr. For each of the infrared matches to X-ray sources in our catalog we derived the probability that the association is real, based on the results of the cross-correlation analysis. The catalog will serve spectroscopic surveys to identify infrared counterparts to X-ray sources near the Galactic center.
astro-ph.GA:We have observed the central region of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 with the Kyoto Tridimensional Spectrograph II (Kyoto3DII) Fabry-Perot mode in order to investigate the properties of its galactic wind. Since this galaxy has a large inclination, it is easy to observe its galactic wind. We produced the Ha, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731 images, as well as those line ratio maps. The [N II]/Ha ratio in the galactic wind region is larger than those in H II regions in the galactic disk. The [N II]/Ha ratio in the southeastern filament, a part of the galactic wind, is the largest and reaches about 1.5. These large [N II]/Ha ratios are explained by shock ionization/excitation. Using the [S II]/Ha ratio map, we spatially separate the galactic wind region from the starburst region. The kinetic energy of the galactic wind can be sufficiently supplied by supernovae in a starburst region in the galactic center. The shape of the galactic wind and the line ratio maps are non-axisymmetric about the galactic minor axis, which is also seen in M82. In the [N II]6583/[S II]6716,6731 map, the positions with large ratios coincide with the positions of star clusters found in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observation. This means that intense star formation causes strong nitrogen enrichment in these regions. Our unique data of the line ratio maps including [S II] lines have demonstrated their effectiveness for clearly distinguishing between shocked gas regions and starburst regions, determining the extent of galactic wind and its mass and kinetic energy, and discovering regions with enhanced nitrogen abundance.
astro-ph.GA:We present consistent modelling of line and continuum IR spectra in the region close to the Galactic center. The models account for the coupled effect of shocks and photoionization from an external source. The results show that the shock velocities range between 65 and 80 km/s, the pre-shock densities between 1 cm-3 in the ISM to 200 cm-3 in the filamentary structures. The pre-shock magnetic field increases from 5. 10^{-6} gauss in the surrounding ISM to ~8. 10^{-5} gauss in the Arched Filaments. The stellar temperatures are ~38000 K in the Quintuplet cluster and ~27000 K in the Arches Cluster. The ionization parameter is relatively low (<0.01) with the highest values near the clusters, reaching a maximum >0.01 near the Arches Cluster. Depletion from the gaseous phase of Si is found throughout the whole observed region, indicating the presence of silicate dust. Grains including iron, are concentrated throughout the Arched Filaments. The modelling of the continuum SED in the IR range, indicates that a component of dust at temperatures of ~100-200 K is present in the central region of the Galaxy. Radio emission appears to be thermal bremsstrahlung in the E2-W1 filaments crossing strip, however a synchrotron component is not excluded. More data are necessary to resolve this questions.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate two multi-shell galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), Kes79 and G352.7-0.1, to understand the causes of such morphology. The research was carried out based on new and reprocessed archival VLA observations and XMM-Newton archival data. The surrounding was investigated based on data extracted from the HI Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, the 13^CO Galactic Ring Survey and the HI Southern Galactic Plane Survey. The present study revealed that the overall morphology of both SNRs is the result of the mass-loss history of their respective progenitor stars. Kes79 would be the product of the gravitational collapse of a massive O9 star evolving near a molecular cloud and within the precursor's wind-driven bubble, while G352.7-0.1 would be the result of interactions of the SNR with an asymmetric wind from the progenitor together with projection effects. No radio point source or pulsar wind nebula was found associated with the X-ray pulsar CXOU J185238.6+004020 in Kes79. The X-ray study of G352.7-0.1, on its hand, revealed that most of the thermal X-ray radiation completely fills in the interior of the remnant and originates in heated ejecta. Characteristic parameters, like radio flux, radio spectral index, age, distance, shock velocity, initial energy and luminosity, were estimated for both SNRs.
astro-ph.GA:Lyman alpha blobs - luminous, spatially extended emission-line nebulae, often lacking bright continuum counterparts - are common in dense environments at high redshift. Until recently, atmospheric absorption and filter technology have limited our knowledge of any similar objects at z<2. We use GALEX slitless spectroscopy to search for similar objects in the rich environments of two known cluster and supercluster fields at z=0.8, where the instrumental sensitivity peaks. The regions around Cl 1054-0321 and Cl 0023+0423 were each observed in slitless-spectrum mode for 10-19 ksec, with accompanying direct images of 3-6 ksec to assist in recognizing continuum sources. Using several detection techniques, we find no resolved Lyman alpha emitters to a flux limit of(1.5-9) x 10^{-15} erg/ cm^2 s, on size scales of 5-30 arcseconds. This corresponds to line luminosities of (0.5-3) x 10^43 erg/s for linear scales 35-200 kpc. Comparison with both blind and targeted surveys at higher redshifts indicates that the population must have evolved in comoving density at least as strongly as (1+z)^3. These results suggest that the population of Lyman alpha blobs is specific to the the high-redshift Universe.
astro-ph.GA:We have re-analyzed continuum and recombination lines radio data available in the literature in order to derive the luminosity function (LF) of Galactic HII regions. The study is performed by considering the first and fourth Galactic quadrants independently. We estimate the completeness level of the sample in the fourth quadrant at 5 Jy, and the one in the first quadrant at 2 Jy. We show that the two samples (fourth or first quadrant) include, as well as giant and super-giant HII regions, a significant number of sub-giant sources. The LF is obtained, in each Galactic quadrant, with a generalized Schmidt's estimator using an effective volume derived from the observed spatial distribution of the considered HII regions. The re-analysis also takes advantage of recently published ancillary absorption data allowing to solve the distance ambiguity for several objects. A single power-law fit to the LFs retrieves a slope equal to -2.23+/-0.07 (fourth quadrant) and to -1.85+/-0.11 (first quadrant). We also find marginal evidence of a luminosity break at L_knee = 10^23.45 erg s^(-1) Hz^(-1) for the LF in the fourth quadrant. We convert radio luminosities into equivalent H_alpha and Lyman continuum luminosities to facilitate comparisons with extra-galactic studies. We obtain an average total HII regions Lyman continuum luminosity of 0.89 +/- 0.23 * 10^(53) sec^(-1), corresponding to 30% of the total ionizing luminosity of the Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:Aims. We investigate the properties of the host galaxy of the blazar J0324+3410 (B2 0321+33) by the analysis of B and R images obtained with the NOT under good photometric conditions. Methods: The galaxy was studied using different methods: Sersic model fitting, unsharp-masked images, B-R image and B-R profile analysis. Results: The images show that the host galaxy has a ring-like morphology. The B-R colour image reveals two bluish zones: one that coincides with the nuclear region, interpreted as the signature of emission related to the active nucleus, the other zone is extended and is located in the host ring-structure. We discuss the hypothesis that the later is thermal emission from a burst of star formation triggered by an interacting/merging process.
astro-ph.GA:Metal-poor globular clusters (GCs) are our local link to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy building. Studies of extragalactic GC systems using deep, high-quality imaging have revealed a small but significant slope to the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor GCs in a number of galaxies. We present a study of the M87 GC system using deep, archival HST/ACS imaging with the F606W and F814W filters, in which we find a significant color-magnitude relation for the metal-poor GCs. The slope of this relation in the I vs. V-I color-magnitude diagram ($\gamma_I=-0.024\pm0.006$) is perfectly consistent with expectations based on previously published results using data from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey. The relation is driven by the most luminous GCs, those with $M_I<-10$, and its significance is largest when fitting metal-poor GCs brighter than $M_I=-7.8$, a luminosity which is ~1 mag fainter than our fitted Gaussian mean for the luminosity function (LF) of blue, metal-poor GCs (~0.8 mag fainter than the mean for all GCs). These results indicate that there is a mass scale at which the correlation begins, and is consistent with a scenario where self-enrichment drives a mass-metallicity relationship. We show that previously measured half-light radii of M87 GCs from best-fit PSF-convolved King models are consistent with the more accurate measurements in this study, and we also explain how the color-magnitude relation for metal-poor GCs is real and cannot be an artifact of the photometry. We fit Gaussian and evolved Schechter functions to the luminosity distribution of GCs across all colors, as well as divided into blue and red subpopulations, finding that the blue GCs have a brighter mean luminosity and a narrower distribution than the red GCs. Finally, we present a catalog of astrometry and photometry for 2250 M87 GCs.
astro-ph.GA:Recently, Hennebelle and Chabrier (2008) derived an analytical theory for the mass spectrum of non self-gravitating clumps associated with overdensities in molecular clouds and for the initial mass function of gravitationally bound prestellar cores, as produced by the turbulent collapse of the cloud. In this companion paper, we examine the effects of the non-isothermality of the flow, of the turbulence forcing and of local fluctuation of the velocity dispersion, on the mass function. In particular, we investigate the influence of a polytropic equation of state and of the effective adiabatic exponent $\gamma$ and find that it has a drastic influence on the low mass part of the IMF. We also consider a barotropic equation of state (i.e. a piecewise polytropic eos) that mimics the thermal behaviour of the molecular gas and compare the prediction of our theory with the results of numerical simulations and with the observationally-derived IMF, for cloud parameters which satisfy Larson's type relations. We find that for clouds whose density is, at all scales, almost an order of magnitude larger than the density inferred for the CO clumps in the Galaxy, a good agreement is obtained between the theory and the observed IMF, suggesting that star formation preferentially occurs in high density environments. We derive an analytical expression for the IMF which generalizes the expression previously obtained for the isothermal case. This easy-to-implement analytical IMF should serve as a template to compare observational or numerical results with the theory.
astro-ph.GA:We propose a Machian model of gravitational interaction at galactic scales to explain the rotation curves of these large structures without the need for dark matter or MOND.
astro-ph.GA:Aims. Expanding HII regions and propagating shocks are common in the environment of young high-mass star-forming complexes. They can compress a pre-existing molecular cloud and trigger the formation of dense cores. We investigate whether these phenomena can explain the formation of high-mass protostars within an infrared dark cloud located at the position of G327.3-0.6 in the Galactic plane, in between two large infrared bubbles and two HII regions. Methods: The region of G327.3-0.6 was imaged at 450 ? m with the CEA P-ArT\'eMiS bolometer array on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment telescope in Chile. APEX/LABOCA and APEX-2A, and Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS archives data were used in this study. Results: Ten massive cores were detected in the P-ArT\'eMiS image, embedded within the infrared dark cloud seen in absorption at both 8 and 24 ?m. Their luminosities and masses indicate that they form high-mass stars. The kinematical study of the region suggests that the infrared bubbles expand toward the infrared dark cloud. Conclusions: Under the influence of expanding bubbles, star formation occurs in the infrared dark areas at the border of HII regions and infrared bubbles.
astro-ph.GA:The fragmentation process in collapsing clouds with various metallicities is studied using three-dimensional nested-grid hydrodynamics. Initial clouds are specified by three parameters: cloud metallicity, initial rotation energy and initial cloud shape. For different combinations of these parameters, we calculate 480 models in total and study cloud evolution, fragmentation conditions, orbital separation and binary frequency. For the cloud to fragment during collapse, the initial angular momentum must be higher than a threshold value, which decreases with decreasing metallicity. Although the exact fragmentation conditions depend also on the initial cloud shape, this dependence is only modest. Our results indicate a higher binary frequency in lower-metallicity gas. In particular, with the same median rotation parameter as in the solar neighbourhood, a majority of stars are born as members of binary/multiple systems for < 10^-4 Z_sun. With initial mass < 0.1 M_sun, if fragments are ejected in embryo from the host clouds by multi-body interaction, they evolve to substellar-mass objects. This provides a formation channel for low-mass stars in zero- or low-metallicity environments.
astro-ph.GA:Current theories of spiral and bar structure predict a variety of pattern speed behaviors, calling for detailed, direct measurement of the radial variation of pattern speeds. Our recently developed Radial Tremaine-Weinberg (TWR) method allows this goal to be achieved for the first time. Here we present TWR spiral pattern speed estimates for M101, IC 342, NGC 3938 and NGC 3344 in order to investigate whether spiral structure is steady or winding, whether spirals are described by multiple pattern speeds, and the relation between bar and spiral speeds. Where possible, we interpret our pattern speeds estimates according to the resonance radii associated with each (established with the disk angular rotation), and compare these to previous determinations. By analyzing the high-quality HI and CO data cubes available for these galaxies, we show that it is possible to determine directly multiple pattern speeds within these systems, and hence identify the characteristic signatures of the processes that drive the spiral structure. Even this small sample of galaxies reveals a surprisingly complex taxonomy, with the first direct evidence for the presence of resonant coupling of multiple patterns found in some systems, and the measurement of a simple single pattern speed in others. Overall, this study demonstrates that we are now in a position to uncover more of the apparently complex physics that lies behind spiral structure.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the statistics of isolated recycled pulsars and double neutron star binaries in the Galactic disk. Since recycled pulsars are believed to form through accretion and spinup in close binaries, the isolated objects presumably originate from disrupted progenitors of double neutron stars. There are a comparable number of double neutron star systems compared to isolated recycled pulsars. We find that standard evolutionary models cannot explain this fact, predicting several times the number of isolated recycled pulsars than those in double neutron star systems. We demonstrate, through population synthesis calculations, that the velocity distribution of isolated recycled pulsars is broader than for binary systems. When this is accounted for in a model for radio pulsar survey selection effects, which include the effects of Doppler smearing for the double neutron star binaries, we find that there is a small (25%) bias towards the detection of double neutron star systems. This bias, however, is not significant enough to explain the observational discrepancy if standard (sigma = 265 km/s) neutron star natal kick velocities are invoked in binary population syntheses. Population syntheses in which the 1D Maxwellian velocity dispersion of the natal kick is sigma=170 km/s are consistent with the observations. These conclusions further support earlier findings the neutron stars formed in close interacting binaries receive significantly smaller natal kicks than the velocities of Galactic single pulsars would seem to indicate.
astro-ph.GA:Early-type galaxies possess a dilute hot (2-10E6 K) gas that is probably the thermalized ejecta of the mass loss from evolving stars. We investigate the processes by which the mass loss from orbiting stars interacts with the stationary hot gas for the case of the mass ejected in a planetary nebula event. Numerical hydrodynamic simulations show that at first, the ejecta expands nearly symmetrically, with an upstream bow shock in the hot ambient gas. At later times, the flow past the ejecta creates fluid instabilities that cause about half of the ejecta to separate and the other half to flow more slowly downstream in a narrow wake. When radiative cooling is included, most of the material in the wake (>80%) remains below 1E5 K while the separated ejecta is hotter (1E5-1E6 K). The separated ejecta is still less than one-quarter the temperature of the ambient medium and the only way it will reach the temperature of the ambient medium is through turbulent mixing (after the material has left the grid). These calculations suggest that a significant fraction of the planetary nebula ejecta may not become part of the hot ambient material. This is in contrast to our previous calculations for continuous mass loss from giant stars in which most of the mass loss became hot gas. We speculate that detectable OVI emission may be produced, but more sophisticated calculations will be required to determine the emission spectrum and to better define the fraction of cooled material.
astro-ph.GA:An unbiased search for debris discs around nearby Sun-like stars is reported. Thirteen G-dwarfs at 12-15 parsecs distance were searched at 850 $\umu$m wavelength, and a disc is confirmed around HD 30495. The estimated dust mass is 0.008 M$_{\oplus}$ with a net limit $\la 0.0025$ M$_{\oplus}$ for the average disc of the other stars. The results suggest there is not a large missed population of substantial cold discs around Sun-like stars -- HD 30495 is a bright rather than unusually cool disc, and may belong to a few hundred Myr-old population of greater dust luminosity. The far-infared and millimetre survey data for Sun-like stars are well fitted by either steady state or stirred models, provided that typical comet belts are comparable in size to that in the Solar System.
astro-ph.GA:We present a novel statistical analysis aimed at deriving the intrinsic shapes and magnetic field orientations of molecular clouds using dust emission and polarization observations by the Hertz polarimeter. Our observables are the aspect ratio of the projected plane-of-the-sky cloud image, and the angle between the mean direction of the plane-of-the-sky component of the magnetic field and the short axis of the cloud image. To overcome projection effects due to the unknown orientation of the line-of-sight, we combine observations from 24 clouds, assuming that line-of-sight orientations are random and all are equally probable. Through a weighted least-squares analysis, we find that the best-fit intrinsic cloud shape describing our sample is an oblate disk with only small degrees of triaxiality. The best-fit intrinsic magnetic field orientation is close to the direction of the shortest cloud axis, with small (~24 deg) deviations toward the long/middle cloud axes. However, due to the small number of observed clouds, the power of our analysis to reject alternative configurations is limited.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) The observed presence of pure CO2 ice in protostellar envelopes is attributed to thermally induced ice segregation, but a lack of quantitative experimental data has prevented its use as a temperature probe. Quantitative segregation studies are also needed to characterize diffusion in ices, which underpins all ice dynamics and ice chemistry. This study aims to quantify the segregation mechanism and barriers in different H2O:CO2 and H2O:CO ice mixtures covering a range of astrophysically relevant ice thicknesses and mixture ratios. The ices are deposited at 16-50 K under (ultra-)high vacuum conditions. Segregation is then monitored at 23-70 K as a function of time, through infrared spectroscopy. Thin (8-37 ML) H2O:CO2/CO ice mixtures segregate sequentially through surface processes, followed by an order of magnitude slower bulk diffusion. Thicker ices (>100 ML) segregate through a fast bulk process. The thick ices must therefore be either more porous or segregate through a different mechanism, e.g. a phase transition. The segregation dynamics of thin ices are reproduced qualitatively in Monte Carlo simulations of surface hopping and pair swapping. The experimentally determined surface-segregation rates for all mixture ratios follow the Ahrrenius law with a barrier of 1080[190] K for H2O:CO2 and 300[100] K for H2O:CO mixtures. During low-mass star formation H2O:CO2 segregation will be important already at 30[5] K. Both surface and bulk segregation is proposed to be a general feature of ice mixtures when the average bond strengths of the mixture constituents in pure ice exceeds the average bond strength in the ice mixture.
astro-ph.GA:We present a method for parametric modelling of the physical components of the Galaxy's magnetised interstellar medium, simulating the observables, and mapping out the likelihood space using a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo analysis. We then demonstrate it using total and polarised synchrotron emission data as well as rotation measures of extragalactic sources. With these three datasets, we define and study three components of the magnetic field: the large-scale coherent field, the small-scale isotropic random field, and the ordered field. In this first paper, we use only data along the Galactic plane and test a simple 2D logarithmic spiral model for the magnetic field that includes a compression and a shearing of the random component giving rise to an ordered component. We demonstrate with simulations that the method can indeed constrain multiple parameters yielding measures of, for example, the ratios of the magnetic field components. Though subject to uncertainties in thermal and cosmic ray electron densities and depending on our particular model parametrisation, our preliminary analysis shows that the coherent component is a small fraction of the total magnetic field and that an ordered component comparable in strength to the isotropic random component is required to explain the polarisation fraction of synchrotron emission. We outline further work to extend this type of analysis to study the magnetic spiral arm structure, the details of the turbulence as well as the 3D structure of the magnetic field.
astro-ph.GA:Context: The Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase is characterised by substantial mass loss that is accompanied by the formation of dust. In extreme cases this will make the star no longer visible in the optical. For a better understanding of AGB evolution it is important to identify and characterise these very red AGB stars.   Aims: The first aim of this article is to improve the census of red AGB stars in three Local Group galaxies, based on near-IR spectroscopic observations of new candidates with red 2MASS (J-K) colours. The opportunity is taken to compare the near-IR spectra with those of Milky Way stars.   Methods: We used ISAAC on the ESO VLT to take J and H-band spectra of 36 targets in Fornax, Sculptor and NGC 6822.   Results: Twelve new C-stars are found in Fornax, and one is confirmed in Sculptor. All C-stars have (J-K) > 1.6, and are brighter than -3.55 in bolometric magnitude. Ten new oxygen-rich late-type giant stars are identified in Fornax, but none is extremely red or very luminous. Five luminous O-rich AGB stars are identified in NGC 6822, of which 3 show water absorption, indicative of spectral type M. Again, none is as red as Milky Way OH/IR stars, but in this galaxy the list of candidate AGB stars is biased against very red objects. In some C-stars with (J-K)>2 an extremely strong 1.53 $\mu$m absorption band is found. These stars are probably all Mira variables and the feature is related to the low temperature, high density chemistry that is a first step towards dust formation and mass loss.
astro-ph.GA:Using arguments parallel to those used in support of using H2CO as a sensitive probe of temperature and density in molecular clouds, we measured the J=7-6 and J=10-9 transitions of thioformaldehyde (H2CS) in several hot core sources. The goal here was to investigate more closely the conditions giving rise to H2CS emission in cloud cores containing young stars by modelling several transitions. The H2CS molecule is a slightly asymmetric rotor, a heavier analogue to H2CO. As in H2CO, transitions occur closely spaced in frequency, though they are substantially separated in energy. Transitions of H2CS originating from the K=0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 ladders in the 230 and 345 GHz windows can productively be used to constrain densities and temperatures. As a first step in developing the use of these transitions as thermometers and densitometers, we surveyed and modeled the emission from well known warm dense cores.
astro-ph.GA:An example of a cold massive core, JCMT 18354-0649S, a possible high mass analogue to a low mass star forming core is studied. Line and continuum observations from JCMT, Mopra Telescope and Spitzer are presented and modelled in detail using a 3D molecular line radiative transfer code. In almost every way JCMT 18354-0649S is a scaled-up version of a typical low mass core with similar temperatures, chemical abundances and densities. The difference is that both the infall velocity and the turbulent width of the line profiles are an order of magnitude larger. While the higher infall velocity is expected due to the large mass of JCMT 18354-0649S, we suggest that the dissipation of this highly supersonic turbulence may lead to the creation of dense clumps of gas that surround the high mass core.
astro-ph.GA:Using our recently improved Monte Carlo evolution code, we study the evolution of the binary fraction in globular clusters. In agreement with previous N-body simulations, we find generally that the hard binary fraction in the core tends to increase with time over a range of initial cluster central densities for initial binary fractions <~ 90%. The dominant processes driving the evolution of the core binary fraction are mass segregation of binaries into the cluster core and preferential destruction of binaries there. On a global scale, these effects and the preferential tidal stripping of single stars tend to roughly balance, leading to overall cluster binary fractions that are roughly constant with time. Our findings suggest that the current hard binary fraction near the half-mass radius is a good indicator of the hard primordial binary fraction. However, the relationship between the true binary fraction and the fraction of main-sequence stars in binaries (which is typically what observers measure) is non-linear and rather complicated. We also consider the importance of soft binaries, which not only modify the evolution of the binary fraction, but can drastically change the evolution of the cluster as a whole. Finally, we describe in some detail the recent addition of single and binary stellar evolution to our cluster evolution code.
astro-ph.GA:We study a northern part of the Corona Australis molecular cloud that consists of a filament and a dense sub-millimetre core inside the filament. Our aim is to measure dust temperature and sub-mm emissivity within the region. We also look for confirmation that near-infrared (NIR) surface brightness can be used to study the structure of even very dense clouds. We extend our previous NIR mapping south of the filament. The dust colour temperatures are estimated using Spitzer 160um and APEX/Laboca 870um maps. The column densities derived based on the reddening of background stars, NIR surface brightness, and thermal sub-mm dust emission are compared. A three dimensional toy model of the filament is used to study the effect of anisotropic illumination on near-infrared surface brightness and the reliability of dust temperature determination. Relative to visual extinction, the estimated emissivity at 870um is kappa(870) = (1.3 +- 0.4) x 10^{-5} 1/mag. This is similar to the values found in diffuse medium. A significant increase in the sub-millimetre emissivity seems to be excluded. In spite of saturation, NIR surface brightness was able to accurately pinpoint, and better than measurements of the colour excesses of background stars, the exact location of the column density maximum. Both near- and far-infrared data show that the intensity of the radiation field is higher south of the filament.
astro-ph.GA:G45.45+0.06 is an ultra-compact HII (UCHII) region extensively studied. It is known that G45.45+0.06 is embedded in a complex of UCHII regions, but up the date, the surrounding ISM in a larger spatial scale has not been analyzed. Using data from large-scale surveys: Two Micron All Sky Survey, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, MAGPIS and GRS, we performed a multiwavelength study of a region about 7' x 7'in the vicinity of G45.45+0.06. We found that the UCHII complex lies in a border of a larger (diameter of ~ 3') and fainter HII region, which is located at the same distance as G45.45+0.06, ~ 8 kpc. In this work, this larger HII region was called G45L. A good morphological correlation is observed between the PDRs and the molecular gas mapped in the 13CO J=1--0 and CS J=2--1 lines, suggesting that G45L may be collecting the molecular material. From a near- and mid-IR photometric study, we found three sources, likely O-type stars, that are possibly responsible for the creation of G45L. Additionally we found several YSO candidates lying preferently in the molecular shell that surrounds G45L. Our results confirm that the region southeastern the UCHII complex where G45.45+0.06 is embedded and eastern G45L is active in star formation. We suggest that G45L has been expanding during about 2 x 10^6 yr and could have triggered the formation of the zero-age main sequence stars that are ionizing the UCHII region G45.45+0.06. However we can not discard that both HII regions are coeval.
astro-ph.GA:We reanalyse the measurements of parallax, proper motion, and line-of-sight velocity for 18 masers in high mass star-forming regions presented by Reid et al. (2009). We use a likelihood analysis to investigate the distance of the Sun from the Galactic centre, R_0, the rotational speed of the local standard of rest, v_0, and the peculiar velocity of the Sun, vsol, for various models of the rotation curve, and models which allow for a typical peculiar motion of the high mass star-forming regions.   We find that these data are best fit by models with non-standard values for vsol or a net peculiar motion of the high mass star-forming regions. We argue that a correction to vsol is much more likely, and that these data support the conclusion of Binney (2009) that V_sol should be revised upwards from 5.2 km/s to 11 km/s. We find that the values of R_0 and v_0 that we determine are heavily dependent on the model we use for the rotation curve, with model-dependent estimates of R_0 ranging from 6.7 \pm 0.5kpc to 8.9 \pm 0.9kpc, and those of v_0 ranging from 200 \pm 20 km/s to 279 \pm 33 km/s. We argue that these data cannot be thought of as implying any particular values of R_0 or v_0. However, we find that v_0/R_0 is better constrained, lying in the range 29.9-31.6 km/s/kpc for all models but one.
astro-ph.GA:Although 70 % of the stars in the Galaxy are M-dwarfs, thermal emission searches for cold debris disks have been conducted mostly for A-type and solar-type stars. We report on new lambda=1.2 mm continuum observations of thirty M-dwarfs, using the MAMBO-2 bolometer array camera at the IRAM 30m telescope. For a statistical analysis, we combine these data with our prior SCUBA and MAMBO-2 observations of 20 other M-dwarfs. Our total sample divides in M-dwarfs in moving groups, with relatively young ages, and in nearby M-dwarfs with unknown ages. Only one cold debris disk (GJ842.2) was detected significantly. We compare the implied disk abundance constraints with those found in two comparable submillimeter surveys of 10 to 190 Myr old A- and FGK-type stars. For the 19 youngest (ages less than 200 Myr) M-dwarfs in our sample, we derive a cold disk fraction of 5.3^{+10.5}_{-5.0} %, compared to 15 +/-11.5 % for FGK-stars and 22^{+33}_{-20} % for A-stars. Hence, for this age group, there is an apparent trend of fewer cold disks for later stellar types, i.e., lower star masses. Although its statistical significance is marginal, this trend is strengthened by the deeper sensitivity of observations in the M-dwarf sample. We derive a cold disk fraction of < 10 % for the older (likely a few Gyr) M-dwarfs in our sample. Finally, although inconclusively related to a debris disk, we present the complex millimeter structure found around the position of the M1.5 dwarf GJ526 in our sample.
astro-ph.GA:We present a multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic study of a newly discovered candidate cluster [DBS2003] 45. Our H, Ks photometry confirms that [DBS2003] 45 is a cluster. An average visual extinction Av 7.1+/-0.5 is needed to fit the cluster sequence with a model isochrone. Low resolution spectroscopy indicates that half a dozen early B and at least one late O type giant stars are present in the cluster. We estimate the age of the cluster to be between 5 and 8 Myr based on spectroscopic analysis. Assuming an age of 6 Myr, we fit the observed mass function with a power law, N(M) M^(-Gamma), and find an index Gamma 1.27+/-0.15, which is consistent with the Salpeter value. We estimate the total cluster mass is around 1000 solar masses by integrating the derived mass function between 0.5 and 45 solar masses. Both mid-infrared and radio wavelength observations show that a bubble filled with ionized gas is associated with the cluster. The total ionizing photon flux estimated from radio continuum measurements is consistent with the number of hot stars we detected. Infrared bright point sources along the rim of the bubble suggest that there is triggered star formation at the periphery of the HII region.
astro-ph.GA:We report first results of first global galactic-scale CR-MHD simulations of cosmic-ray-driven dynamo. We investigate the dynamics of magnetized interstellar medium (ISM), which is dynamically coupled with the cosmic-ray (CR) gas. We assume that exploding stars deposit small-scale, randomly oriented, dipolar magnetic fields into the differentially rotating ISM, together with a portion of cosmic rays, accelerated in supernova shocks. We conduct numerical simulations with the aid of a new parallel MHD code PIERNIK. We find that the initial magnetization of galactic disks by exploding magnetized stars forms a favourable conditions for the cosmic-ray-driven dynamo. We demonstrate that dipolar magnetic fields supplied on small SN-remnant scales, can be amplified exponentially, by the CR-driven dynamo, to the present equipartition values, and transformed simultaneously to large galactic-scales. The resulting magnetic field structure in an evolved galaxy appears spiral in the face-on view and reveals the so called X-shaped structure in the edge-on view.
astro-ph.GA:Column densities for H I, Al III, Si IV, C IV, and O VI toward 109 stars and 30 extragalactic objects have been assembled to study the extensions of these species away from the Galactic plane into the Galactic halo. H I and Al III mostly trace the warm neutral and warm ionized medium, respectively, while Si IV, C IV and O VI trace a combination of warm photoionized and collisionally ionized plasmas. The much larger object sample compared to previous studies allows us to consider and correct for the effects of the sample bias that has affected earlier but smaller surveys of the gas distributions. We find Si IV and C IV have similar exponential scale heights of 3.2(+1.0, -0.6) and 3.6(+1.0, -0.8) kpc. The scale height of O VI is marginally smaller with h = 2.6+/- 0.6 kpc. The transition temperature gas is ~3 times more extended than the warm ionized medium traced by Al III with h = 0.90(+0.62, -0.33) kpc and ~12 times more extended than the warm neutral medium traced by H I with h = 0.24 +/- 0.06 kpc. There is a factor of 2 decrease in the dispersion of the log of the column density ratios for transition temperature gas for lines of sight in the Galactic disk compared to extragalactic lines of sight through the entire halo. The observations are compared to the predictions of the various models for the production of the transition temperature gas in the halo. The appendix presents a revision to the electron scale height proposed by Gaensler et al. (2008) based on electron dispersion measures.
astro-ph.GA:We present the first observations from a large-scale survey of nearby (z < 1) long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB) host galaxies, which consist of eight rest-frame optical spectra obtained at Keck and Magellan. Along with two host galaxy observations from the literature, we use optical emission line diagnostics to determine metallicities, ionization parameters, young stellar population ages, and star formation rates. We compare the LGRB host environments to a variety of local and intermediate-redshift galaxy populations, as well as the newest grid of stellar population synthesis and photoionization models generated with the Starburst99/Mappings codes. With these comparisons we investigate whether the GRB host galaxies are consistent with the properties of the general galaxy population, and therefore whether they may be used as reliable tracers of star formation. We find that LGRB host galaxies generally have low-metallicity ISM environments out to z ~ 1. The ISM properties of our GRB hosts, including metallicity, ionization parameter, and young stellar population age, are significantly different from the general galaxy population, host galaxies of nearby broad-lined Type Ic supernovae, and nearby metal-poor galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:In the Galaxy there are 64 Be X-ray binaries known to-date. Out of those, 42 host a neutron star, and for the reminder the nature of a companion is not known. None, so far, is known to host a black hole. There seems to be no apparent mechanism that would prevent formation or detection of Be stars with black holes. This disparity is referred to as a missing Be -- black hole X-ray binary problem. We point out that current evolutionary scenarios that lead to the formation of Be X-ray binaries predict that the ratio of these binaries with neutron stars to the ones with black holes is rather high F_NStoBH=10-50, with the more likely formation models providing the values at the high end. The ratio is a natural outcome of (i) the stellar initial mass function that produces more neutron stars than black holes and (ii) common envelope evolution (i.e. a major mechanism involved in the formation of interacting binaries) that naturally selects progenitors of Be X-ray binaries with neutron stars (binaries with comparable mass components have more likely survival probabilities) over ones with black holes (which are much more likely to be common envelope mergers). A comparison of this ratio (i.e. F_NStoBH=30) with the number of confirmed Be -- neutron star X-ray binaries (42) indicates that the expected number of Be -- black hole X-ray binaries is of the order of only 0-2. This is entirely consistent with the observed Galactic sample.
astro-ph.GA:We present Submillimter Array 1.3 mm waveband continuum and molecular line observations of the HH 80-81 high-mass star-forming region. The dust continuum emission reveals two dominant peaks MM1 and MM2, and line emission from high-density tracers suggests the presence of another core MC. Molecular line emission from MM1, which harbors the exciting source of the HH 80-81 radio jet, yields a hot molecular core at a gas temperature of 110 K. The two younger cores MM2 and MC both appear to power collimated CO outflows. In particular, the outflow arising from MM2 exhibits a jet-like morphology and a broad velocity range of 190 km/s. The outflow contains compact and fast moving molecular clumps, known as "molecular bullets" first discovered in low-mass class 0 protostellar outflows. These "bullets" cannot be locally entrained or swept up from the ambient gas, but are more likely ejected from the close vicinity of the central protostar. The discovery of this remarkable outflow manifests an episodic, disk-mediated accretion for massive star formation.
astro-ph.GA:We present an investigation of candidate Infrared Dark Cloud cores as identified by Simon et al. (2006) located within the SCUBA Legacy Catalogue. After applying a uniform noise cut to the Catalogue data we identify 154 Infrared Dark Cloud cores that were detected at 850um and 51 cores that were not. We derive column densities for each core from their 8um extinction and find that the IRDCs detected at 850um have higher column densities (a mean of 1.7x10^22 cm-2) compared to those cores not detected at 850um (a mean of 1.0x10^22 cm-2). Combined with sensitivity estimates, we suggest that the cores not detected at 850um are low mass, low column density and low temperature cores that are below the sensitivity limit of SCUBA at 850um. For a subsample of the cores detected at 850um those contained within the MIPSGAL area) we find that two thirds are associated with 24um sources. Cores not associated with 24um emission are either ``starless'' IRDC cores that perhaps have yet to form stars, or contain low mass YSOs below the MIPSGAL detection limit. We see that those ``starless'' IRDC cores and the IRDC cores associated with 24um emission are drawn from the same column density population and are of similar mass. If we then assume the cores without 24um embedded sources are at an earlier evolutionary stage to cores with embedded objects we derive a statistical lifetime for the quiescent phase of a few 10^3-10^4 years. Finally, we make conservative predictions for the number of observed IRDCs that will be observed by the Apex Telescope Galactic Plane Survey (ATLASGAL), the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL), the JCMT Galactic Plane Survey (JPS) and the SCUBA-2 ``All Sky'' Survey (SASSy).
astro-ph.GA:Context. We present a photometric and astrometric catalog of 187963 stars located in the field around the old super-metal-rich Galactic open cluster NGC 6253. The total field-of-view covered by the catalog is 34' x 33'. In this field, we provide CCD BVRI photometry. For a smaller region close to the cluster's center, we also provide near-infrared JHK photometry. Aims. We analyze the properties of NGC 6253 by using our new photometric data and astrometric membership. Methods. In June 2004, we targeted the cluster during a 10 day multi-site campaign, which involved the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope with its wide-field imager and the Anglo-Australian 3.9m telescope, equipped with the IRIS2 near-infrared imager. Archival CCD images of NGC 6253 were used to derive relative proper motions and to calculate the cluster membership probabilities. Results. We have refined the cluster's fundamental parameters, deriving (V_0-M_v)=11.15, E(B - V)=0.15, E(V - I)=0.25, E(V - J)=0.50, and E(V - H)=0.55. The color excess ratios obtained using both the optical and near infrared colors indicate a normal reddening law in the direction of NGC 6253. The age of NGC 6253 at 3.5 Gyr, determined from our best-fitting isochrone appears to be slightly older than the previous estimates. Finally, we estimated the binary fraction among the cluster members to be \sim20%-30% and identified 11 blue straggler candidates.
astro-ph.GA:The formation of water molecules from the reaction between ozone (O3) and D-atoms is studied experimentally for the first time. Ozone is deposited on non-porous amorphous solid water ice (H2O), and D-atoms are then sent onto the sample held at 10 K. HDO molecules are detected during the desorption of the whole substrate where isotope mixing takes place, indicating that water synthesis has occurred. The efficiency of water formation via hydrogenation of ozone is of the same order of magnitude of that found for reactions involving O atoms or O2 molecules and exhibits no apparent activation barrier. These experiments validate the assumption made by models using ozone as one of the precursors of water formation via solid-state chemistry on interstellar dust grains.
astro-ph.GA:The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) has been used to determine positions for many southern methanol maser sites, with accuracy better than 1 arcsec. The results are presented here as a catalogue of more than 350 distinct sites, some of them new discoveries, and many others with positional precision 10 times better than existing published values. Clusters of 2 or 3 sites are occasionally found to account for single previously listed sources. This in turn reveals that the velocity range for each individual site is sometimes smaller than that of the originally tabulated (blended) source. Only a handful of examples then remain with a velocity range of more than 16 km/s at a single compact (less than 2 arcsec) site. The precise methanol positions now allow apparent coincidences with OH masers to be confidently accepted or rejected; this has led to the important conclusion that, where a 1665-MHz OH maser lies in a massive star formation region, at more than 80 percent of the OH sites there is a precisely coincident methanol maser. The methanol precision achieved here will also allow clear comparisons with likely associated IR sources when the next generation of far-IR surveys produce precise positions.
astro-ph.GA:We estimated the galactic model parameters for a set of 20 intermediate-latitude fields with galactic longitudes 0<l<100 and 160<l<240, included in the currently available Data Release 6 (DR6) of SDSS, to explore their possible variation with galactic longitude. The local space densities of the thick disc and halo are almost the same for all fields, <(n_{2}/n_{1})>=6.52% and <(n_{3}/n_{1})>=0.35%, respectively, a result different than the one cited for high-latitude fields. The thin disc's scaleheight is 325 pc in the galactic centre changes to 369 pc in the third quadrant, which confirms the existence of disc flare, whereas the thick disc scaleheight is as large as 952 pc at galactic longitude l=20 and 10% lower at l=160, which confirms the existence of the disc long bar in the direction l=27. Finally, the variation of the axis ratio of the halo with galactic longitude is almost flat, <(c/a)>=0.56, except a slight minimum and a small maximum in the second and third quadrants, respectively, indicating an effect of the long bar which seems plausible for a shallow halo. We estimated the metallicities of unevolved G-type stars and discussed the metallicity gradient for different vertical distances. The metallicity gradient is d[M/H]/dz=-0.30 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for short distances, confirming the formation of this region of the Galaxy by dissipational collapse. However, its change is steeper in the transition regions of different galactic components. The metallicity gradient is almost zero for inner halo (5<z<10 kpc), indicating a formation of merger or accretion of numerous fragments such as dwarf galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:The southern maser site OH 300.969+1.147 has been studied using the Long Baseline Array of the Australia Telescope National Facility. The 1665- and 1667-MHz hydroxyl ground-state transitions were observed simultaneously. A series of maps with tenth-arcsec spatial resolution, at velocity spacing 0.09 km/s, and in both senses of circular polarization, reveal 59 small diameter maser spots. The spots are scattered over 2-arcsec, coincident with a strong ultracompact HII region, at a distance of 4.3 kpc. 17 Zeeman pairs of oppositely polarized spots were found, all yielding magnetic field estimates towards us (negative), ranging from -1.1 to -4.7 mG, with a median value of -3.5 mG. Excited state masers of OH at 6035 MHz and 6030 MHz at this site also display Zeeman pairs revealing a magnetic field of -5.0 mG. Weak methanol maser emission is intermingled with the OH masers, but there is no detectable closely related water maser. The consistent magnetic field direction found within this site is a striking feature of several other maser sites associated with strong HII regions studied in comparable detail. We interpret the site as a mature region nearing the end of the brief evolutionary stage that can support maser emission.
astro-ph.GA:Masers found in massive star-forming regions can be located precisely in six-dimensional phase space and therefore serve as a tool for studying Milky Way dynamics. The non-random orbital phases at which the masers are found and the sparseness of current samples require modeling. Here we model the phase-space distribution function of 18 precisely measured Galactic masers, permitting a mean velocity offset and a general velocity dispersion tensor relative to their local standards of rest, and accounting for different pieces of prior information. With priors only on the Sun's distance from the Galactic Center and on its motion with respect to the local standard of rest, the maser data provide a weak constraint on the circular velocity at the Sun of V_c = 246 +/- 30 km/s. Including prior information on the proper motion of Sgr A* leads to V_c = 244 +/- 13 km/s. We do not confirm the value of V_c \approx 254 km/s found in more restrictive models. This analysis shows that there is no conflict between recent determinations of V_c from Galactic Center analyses, orbital fitting of the GD-1 stellar stream, and the kinematics of Galactic masers; a combined estimate is V_c = 236 +/- 11 km/s. Apart from the dynamical parameters, we find that masers tend to occur at post-apocenter, circular-velocity-lagging phases of their orbits.
astro-ph.GA:We explore the parameter space of the two temperature pseudo-Newtonian Keplerian accretion flow model for the millimeter and shorter wavelength emission from Sagittarius A*. A general relativistic ray-tracing code is used to treat the radiative transfer of polarized synchrotron emission from the flow. The synchrotron self-Comptonization and bremsstrahlung emission components are also included. It is shown that the model can readily account for the millimeter to sub-millimeter emission characteristics with an accretion rate of ~6x10^17g.s^-1 and an inclination angle of ~40 deg. However, the corresponding model predicted near-infrared and X-ray fluxes are more than one order of magnitude lower than the observed 'quiescent' state values. While the extended quiescent-state X-ray emission has been attributed to thermal emission from the large-scale accretion flow, the NIR emission and flares are likely dominated by emission regions either within the last stable orbit of a Schwarzschild black hole or associated with outflows. With the viscous parameter derived from numerical simulations, there is still a degeneracy between the electron heating rate and the magnetic parameter. A fully general relativistic treatment with the black hole spin incorporated will resolve these issues.
astro-ph.GA:We have performed near-infrared monitoring observations of Sgr A*, the Galactic center radio source associated with a supermassive black hole, with the near-infrared camera CIAO and the 36-element adaptive optics system on the Subaru telescope. We observed three flares in the Ks band (2.15micron) during 220 min monitoring on 2008 May 28, and confirmed the flare emission is highly polarized, supporting the synchrotron radiation nature of the near-infrared emission. Clear variations in the degree and position angle of polarization were also detected: an increase of the degree of polarization of about 20 %, and a swing of the position angle of about 60 - 70 degrees in the declining phase of the flares. The correlation between the flux and the degree of polarization can be well explained by the flare emission coming from hotspot(s) orbiting Sgr A*. Comparison with calculations in the literature gives a constraint to the inclination angle i of the orbit of the hotspot around Sgr A*, as 45 < i < 90 degrees (close to edge-on).
astro-ph.GA:The dark matter halos in $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations are triaxial and highly flattened. In many cases, these triaxial equilibria are also tumbling slowly, typically about their short axes, with periods of order a Hubble time. Halos may therefore exert a slowly changing external torque on spiral galaxies that can affect their dynamical evolution in interesting ways. We examine the effect of the external torques exerted by a tumbling quadrupolar tidal field on the evolution of spiral galaxies using N-body simulations with realistic, disk galaxy models. We measure the amplitude of the external quadrupole moments of dark halos in cosmological simulations and use these to force disk galaxy models in a series of N-body experiments for a range of pattern speeds. We find that the torques are strong enough to induce long lived transient warps in disks similar to those observed in real spirals and also induce the bar instability at later times in some galaxy models that are otherwise stable for long periods of time in isolation. We also observe forced spiral structure near the edge of the disk where normally self-gravity is too weak to be responsible for such structure. This overlooked influence of dark halos may well be responsible for many of the peculiar aspects of disk galaxy dynamics.
astro-ph.GA:Analysis of high-precision timing observations of an array of approx. 20 millisecond pulsars (a so-called "timing array") may ultimately result in the detection of a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The feasibility of such a detection and the required duration of this type of experiment are determined by the achievable rms of the timing residuals and the timing stability of the pulsars involved. We present results of the first long-term, high-precision timing campaign on a large sample of millisecond pulsars used in gravitational-wave detection projects. We show that the timing residuals of most pulsars in our sample do not contain significant low-frequency noise that could limit the use of these pulsars for decade-long gravitational-wave detection efforts. For our most precisely timed pulsars, intrinsic instabilities of the pulsars or the observing system are shown to contribute to timing irregularities on a five-year timescale below the 100 ns level. Based on those results, realistic sensitivity curves for planned and ongoing timing array efforts are determined. We conclude that prospects for detection of a gravitational-wave background through pulsar timing array efforts within five years to a decade are good.
astro-ph.GA:We present results from the high precision timing analysis of the pulsar-white dwarf (WD) binary PSR J1012+5307 using 15 years of multi-telescope data. Observations were performed regularly by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) network, consisting of Effelsberg, Jodrell Bank, Westerbork and Nan\c{c}ay. All the timing parameters have been improved from the previously published values, most by an order of magnitude. In addition, a parallax measurement of $\pi = 1.2(3)$ mas is obtained for the first time for PSR J1012+5307, being consistent with the optical estimation from the WD companion. Combining improved 3D velocity information and models for the Galactic potential the complete evolutionary Galactic path of the system is obtained. A new intrinsic eccentricity upper limit of $e<8.4\times 10^{-7}$ is acquired, one of the smallest calculated for a binary system and a measurement of the variation of the projected semi-major axis also constrains the system's orbital orientation for the first time. It is shown that PSR J1012+5307 is an ideal laboratory for testing alternative theories of gravity. The measurement of the change of the orbital period of the system of $\dot{P}_{b} = 5(1)\times 10^{-14}$ is used to set an upper limit on the dipole gravitational wave emission that is valid for a wide class of alternative theories of gravity. Moreover, it is shown that in combination with other binary pulsars PSR J1012+5307 is an ideal system to provide self-consistent, generic limits, based only on millisecond pulsar data, for the dipole radiation and the variation of the gravitational constant $\dot{G}$.
astro-ph.GA:We report on the structure of the nuclear star cluster in the innermost 0.16 pc of the Galaxy as measured by the number density profile of late-type giants. Using laser guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with the integral field spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we are able to differentiate between the older, late-type ($\sim$ 1 Gyr) stars, which are presumed to be dynamically relaxed, and the unrelaxed young ($\sim$ 6 Myr) population. This distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp formation in the vicinity of a black hole, as the models assume that the cusp stars are in dynamical equilibrium in the black hole potential. Based on the late-type stars alone, the surface stellar number density profile, $\Sigma(R) \propto R^{-\Gamma}$, is flat, with $\Gamma = -0.27\pm0.19$. Monte Carlo simulations of the possible de-projected volume density profile, n(r) $\propto r^{-\gamma}$, show that $\gamma$ is less than 1.0 at the 99.73 % confidence level. These results are consistent with the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with a core profile that is significantly flatter than predicted by most cusp formation theories, and even allows for the presence of a central hole in the stellar distribution. Of the possible dynamical interactions that can lead to the depletion of the red giants observable in this survey -- stellar collisions, mass segregation from stellar remnants, or a recent merger event -- mass segregation is the only one that can be ruled out as the dominant depletion mechanism. The lack of a stellar cusp around a supermassive black hole would have important implications for black hole growth models and inferences on the presence of a black hole based upon stellar distributions.
astro-ph.GA:Using the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory 10.4-meter telescope, we performed sensitive mapping observations of 12CO J=7-6 emission at 807 GHz towards Orion IRc2. The image has an angular resolution of 10", which is the highest angular resolution data toward the Orion Hot Core published for this transition. In addition, thanks to the on-the-fly mapping technique, the fidelity of the new image is rather high, particularly in comparison to previous images. We have succeeded in mapping the northwest-southeast high-velocity molecular outflow, whose terminal velocity is shifted by ~70-85 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity of the cloud. This yields an extremely short dynamical time scale of ~900 years. The estimated outflow mass loss rate shows an extraordinarily high value, on the order of 10^{-3} Msun/yr. Assuming that the outflow is driven by Orion IRc2, our result agrees with the picture so far obtained for a 20 Msun (proto)star in the process of formation.
astro-ph.GA:We present a new analysis of the observed perturbations of the HI disk of the Milky Way to infer the existence of a dark sub-halo that tidally interacted with the Milky Way disk. We examine tidal interactions between perturbing dark sub-halos and the gas disk of the Milky Way using high resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We compare our results to the observed HI map of the Milky Way to find that the Fourier amplitudes of the planar disturbances are best-fit by a perturbing dark sub-halo with a mass that is one-hundredth of the Milky Way with a pericentric distance of 5 kpc. This best-fit to the Fourier modes occurs about a dynamical time after pericentric approach, when the perturber is 90 kpc from the galactic center. Our analysis here represents a new method to indirectly characterize dark sub-halos from the tidal gravitational imprints they leave on the gaseous disks of galaxies. We also elucidate a fundamental property of parabolic orbits. We show that under certain conditions, one can break the degeneracy between the mass of the perturber and the pericentric distance in the evaluation of the tidal force -- to directly determine the mass of the dark perturber that produced the observed disturbances.
astro-ph.GA:We present results of large-scale three-dimensional simulations of weakly magnetized supersonic turbulence at grid resolutions up to 1024^3 cells. Our numerical experiments are carried out with the Piecewise Parabolic Method on a Local Stencil and assume an isothermal equation of state. The turbulence is driven by a large-scale isotropic solenoidal force in a periodic computational domain and fully develops in a few flow crossing times. We then evolve the flow for a number of flow crossing times and analyze various statistical properties of the saturated turbulent state. We show that the energy transfer rate in the inertial range of scales is surprisingly close to a constant, indicating that Kolmogorov's phenomenology for incompressible turbulence can be extended to magnetized supersonic flows. We also discuss numerical dissipation effects and convergence of different turbulence diagnostics as grid resolution refines from 256^3 to 1024^3 cells.
astro-ph.GA:We use the newest generation of the Starburst99/Mappings code to generate an extensive suite of models to facilitate detailed studies of star-forming galaxies and their ISM properties, particularly at low metallicities. The new models used include a rigorous treatment of metal opacities in the population synthesis modeling and more detailed dust physics in the photoionization code. These models span a wide range of physical parameters including metallicity, ionization parameter, and the adoption of both a instantaneous burst and continuous star formation history. We examine the agreement between our models and local (z < 0.1) star-forming galaxy populations from several large datasets, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey, and samples of blue compact galaxies and metal-poor galaxies. We find that models adopting a continuous star formation history reproduce the metallicity-sensitive line ratios observed in the local population of star-forming galaxies, including the low-metallicity sample. However, we find that the current codes generate an insufficiently hard ionizing radiation field, leading to deficiencies in the [SII] fluxes produced by the models. We consider the advantages and short-comings of this suite of models, and discuss future work and improvements that can be applied to the modeling of star-forming galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:We aim at studying with high angular resolution a dense core associated with a low-luminosity IRAS source, IRAS 00213+6530, in order to investigate whether low mass star formation is really taking place in isolation. We performed observations at 1.2mm with the IRAM 30m telescope, VLA observations at 6cm, 3.6cm, 1.3cm, 7mm, and H2O maser and NH3 lines, and observations with the NASA 70m antenna in CCS and H2O maser. The cm and mm continuum emission, together with the near infrared data from the 2MASS allowed us to identify 3 YSOs, IRS1, VLA8A, and VLA8B, with different radio and infrared properties, and which seem to be in different evolutionary stages. The NH3 emission consists of three clouds. Two of these, MM1 and MM2, are associated with dust emission, while the southern cloud is only detected in NH3. The YSOs are embedded in MM1, where we found evidence of line broadening and temperature enhancements. On the other hand, the southern cloud and MM2 appear to be quiescent and starless. We modeled the radial intensity profile at 1.2mm of MM1. The model fits reasonably well the data, but it underestimates the intensity at small projected distances from the 1.2mm peak, probably due to the presence of multiple YSOs embedded in the envelope. There is a differentiation in the relative NH3 abundance with low values, ~2x10^-8, toward MM1, and high values, up to 10^-6, toward the southern cloud and MM2, suggesting that these clouds could be in a young evolutionary stage. IRAS 00213+6530 is harboring a multiple system of low-mass protostars, indicating that star formation in this cloud is taking place in groups, rather than in isolation. The low-mass YSOs found in IRAS 00213+6530 are in different evolutionary stages suggesting that star formation is taking place in different episodes.
astro-ph.GA:As the second step in our investigation of the mass-to-light ratio of spiral disks, we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of planetary nebulae (PNe) in five nearby, low-inclination galaxies: IC 342, M74 (NGC 628), M83 (NGC 5236), M94 (NGC 4736), and M101 (NGC 5457). Using 50 setups of the WIYN/Hydra and Blanco/Hydra spectrographs, and 25 observations with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope's Medium Resolution Spectrograph, we determine the radial velocities of 99, 102, 162, 127, and 48 PNe, respectively, to a precision better than 15 km/s. Although the main purpose of this data set is to facilitate dynamical mass measurements throughout the inner and outer disks of large spiral galaxies, our spectroscopy has other uses as well. Here, we co-add these spectra to show that to first order, the [O III] and Balmer line ratios of planetary nebulae vary little over the top ~1.5 mag of the planetary nebula luminosity function. The only obvious spectral change occurs with [N II], which increases in strength as one proceeds down the luminosity function. We also show that typical [O III]-bright planetaries have E(B-V) ~ 0.2 of circumstellar extinction, and that this value is virtually independent of [O III] luminosity. We discuss the implications this has for understanding the population of PN progenitors.
astro-ph.GA:We discuss the capability of AKARI in recovering diffuse far-infrared emission, and examine the achieved reliability. Critical issues in making images of diffuse emission are the transient response and long-term stability of the far-infrared detectors. Quantitative evaluation of these characteristics are the key to achieving sensitivity comparable to or better than that for point sources (< 20 -- 95 MJy sr-1). We describe current activity and progress toward the production of high quality images of the diffuse far-infrared emission using the AKARI all-sky survey data.
astro-ph.GA:We present an analysis of wide-field infrared extinction maps of a region in Perseus just north of the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud complex. From this analysis we have identified a massive, nearby, but previously unrecognized, giant molecular cloud (GMC). From comparison of foreground star counts with Galactic models we derive a distance of 450 +/- 23 parsecs to the cloud. At this distance the cloud extends over roughly 80 pc and has a mass of approximately 10^5 solar masses, rivaling the Orion (A) Molecular Cloud as the largest and most massive GMC in the solar neighborhood. Although surprisingly similar in mass and size to the more famous Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) the newly recognized cloud displays significantly less star formation activity with more than an order of magnitude fewer young stellar objects than found in the OMC, suggesting that both the level of star formation and perhaps the star formation rate in this cloud are an order of magnitude or more lower than in the OMC. Analysis of extinction maps of both clouds shows that the new cloud contains only 10% the amount of high extinction (A_K > 1.0 mag) material as is found in the OMC. This, in turn, suggests that the level of star formation activity and perhaps the star formation rate in these two clouds may be directly proportional to the total amount of high extinction material and presumably high density gas within them and that there might be a density threshold for star formation on the order of a few times 10^4 hydrogen molecules per cc.
astro-ph.GA:We show how the hypothesis that galaxy discs conform to self-similar dynamics leads to an objective identification, in the data, of an annular region of the optical disc which is such that, corresponding to the classical Tully-Fisher scaling law defined on the exterior annular boundary, there is a similar scaling law defined on the interior annular boundary. This result is confirmed at the level of statistical certainty over several large ORC samples. Furthermore, the same analysis provides insight into the uncertainties associated with the best way of defining Vmax, the rotation velocity used for the Tully-Fisher scaling law and Rmax, the galaxy radius at which Vmax is measured. Finally, as a direct consequence, we are led to a refined Tully-Fisher law which is largely insensitive to the means by which a galaxy's rotation velocity is defined.
astro-ph.GA:An important dynamic parameter of barred galaxies is the bar pattern speed. Among several methods that are used for the determination of the pattern speed the Tremaine-Weinberg method has the advantage of model independency and accuracy. In this work we apply the method to a simulated bar including gas dynamics and study the effect of 2D spectroscopy data quality on robustness of the method. We added a white noise and a Gaussian random field to the data and measured the corresponding errors in the pattern speed. We found that a signal to noise ratio in surface density ~5 introduces errors of ~20% for the Gaussian noise, while for the white noise the corresponding errors reach ~50%. At the same time the velocity field is less sensitive to contamination. On the basis of the performed study we applied the method to the NGC 3367 spiral galaxy using H{\alpha} Fabry-Perot interferometry data. We found for the pattern speed 43 \pm 6 km/s/kpc for this galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:Testing Newtonian gravity in the weak-acceleration regime is vital to our understanding of the nature of the gravitational interaction. It has recently been claimed that the velocity dispersion profiles of several globular clusters flatten out at large radii, reminiscent of galaxy rotation curves, even though globular clusters are thought to contain little or no dark matter. We investigate this claim, using AAOmega observations of four globular clusters, namely M22, M30, M53 and M68. M30, one such cluster that has had this claim made for its velocity dispersion, was included for comparison with previous studies. We find no statistically significant flattening of the velocity dispersion at large radii for any of our target clusters and therefore we infer the observed dynamics do not require that globular clusters are dark matter dominated, or a modification of gravity. Furthermore, by applying a simple dynamical model we determine the radial mass-to-light profiles for each cluster. The isothermal rotations of each cluster are also measured, with M22 exhibiting clear rotation, M68 possible rotation and M30 and M53 lacking any rotation, within the uncertainties.
astro-ph.GA:The complex-shift method is applied to the Kuzmin-Toomre family of discs to generate a family of non-axisymmetric flat distributions of matter. These are then superposed to construct non-axisymmetric flat rings. We also consider triaxial potential-density pairs obtained from these non-axisymmetric flat systems by means of suitable transformations. The use of the imaginary part of complex-shifted potential-density pairs is also discussed.
astro-ph.GA:Recent observations of cosmic ray electrons from several instruments have revealed various degrees of deviation in the measured electron energy distribution from a simple power-law, in a form of an excess around TeV energies. An even more prominent deviation has been observed in the fraction of cosmic ray positrons around 100 GeV energies. In this paper we show that the observed excesses in the electron spectrum may be easily re-produced without invoking any unusual sources other than the general diffuse Galactic components of cosmic rays. The primary physical effect involved is the Klein-Nishina suppression of the electron cooling rate around TeV energies. With a very reasonable choice of the model parameters characterizing the local interstellar medium, we can reproduce the most recent observations by Fermi and HESS experiments. We also find that high positron fraction increasing with energy, as claimed by the PAMELA experiment, cannot be explained in our model with the conservative set of the model parameters. We are able, however, to reproduce the PAMELA results assuming high values of the starlight and interstellar gas densities, which would be more appropriate for vicinities of supernova remnants. A possible solution to this problem may be that cosmic rays undergo most of their interactions near their sources due to the efficient trapping in the far upstream of supernova shocks by self-generated, cosmic ray-driven turbulence.
astro-ph.GA:We perform numerical simulations of clouds in the Galactic Centre (GC) engulfing the nuclear super-massive black hole and show that this mechanism leads to the formation of gaseous accretion discs with properties that are similar to the expected gaseous progenitor discs that fragmented into the observed stellar disc in the GC. As soon as the cloud hits the black hole, gas with opposite angular momentum relative to the black hole collides downstream. This process leads to redistribution of angular momentum and dissipation of kinetic energy, resulting in a compact gaseous accretion disc. A parameter study using thirteen high resolution simulations of homogeneous clouds falling onto the black hole and engulfing it in parts demonstrates that this mechanism is able to produce gaseous accretion discs that could potentially be the progenitor of the observed stellar disc in the GC. A comparison of simulations with different equations of state (adiabatic, isothermal and full cooling) demonstrates the importance of including a detailed thermodynamical description. However the simple isothermal approach already yields good results on the radial mass transfer and accretion rates, as well as disc eccentricities and sizes. We find that the cloud impact parameter strongly influences the accretion rate whereas the impact velocity has a small affect on the accretion rate.
astro-ph.GA:We present new results from BRAVA, a large scale radial velocity survey of the Galactic bulge, using M giant stars selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalogue as targets for the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4m Hydra multi-object spectrograph. The purpose of this survey is to construct a new generation of self-consistent bar models that conform to these observations. We report the dynamics for fields at the edge of the Galactic bulge at latitudes b=-8 deg. and compare to the dynamics at b=-4 deg. We find that the rotation curve V(r) is the same at b=-8 deg. as at b=-4 deg. That is, the Galactic boxy bulge rotates cylindrically, as do boxy bulges of other galaxies. The summed line of sight velocity distribution at b=-8 deg. is Gaussian, and the binned longitude-velocity plot shows no evidence for either a (disk) population with cold dynamics or for a (classical bulge) population with hot dynamics. The observed kinematics are well modeled by an edge-on N-body bar, in agreement with published structural evidence. Our kinematic observations indicate that the Galactic bulge is a prototypical product of secular evolution in galaxy disks, in contrast with stellar population results that are most easily understood if major mergers were the dominant formation process.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) Gas-phase complex organic molecules are commonly detected in the warm inner regions of protostellar envelopes. Recent models show that photochemistry in ices followed by desorption may explain the observed abundances. This study aims to experimentally quantify the broad-band UV-induced production rates of complex organics in CH3OH-rich ices at 20-70 K under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The reaction products are mainly identified by RAIRS and TPD experiments. Complex organics are readily formed in all experiments, both during irradiation and during a slow warm-up of the ices to 200 K after the UV lamp is turned off. The relative abundances of photoproducts depend on the UV fluence, the ice temperature, and whether pure CH3OH ice or CH3OH:CH4/CO ice mixtures are used. C2H6, CH3CHO, CH3CH2OH, CH3OCH3, HCOOCH3, HOCH2CHO and (CH2OH)2 are all detected in at least one experiment. The derived product-formation yields and their dependences on different experimental parameters, such as the initial ice composition, are used to estimate the CH3OH photodissociation branching ratios in ice and the relative diffusion barriers of the formed radicals. The experiments show that ice photochemistry in CH3OH ices is efficient enough to explain the observed abundances of complex organics around protostars and that ratios of complex molecules can be used to constrain their formation pathway.
astro-ph.GA:We study the abundance of CCH in prestellar cores both because of its role in the chemistry and because it is a potential probe of the magnetic field. We also consider the non-LTE behaviour of the N=1-0 and N=2-1 transitions of CCH and improve current estimates of the spectroscopic constants of CCH. We used the IRAM 30m radiotelescope to map the N=1-0 and N=2-1 transitions of CCH towards the prestellar cores L1498 and CB246. Towards CB246, we also mapped the 1.3 mm dust emission, the J=1-0 transition of N2H+ and the J=2-1 transition of C18O. We used a Monte Carlo radiative transfer program to analyse the CCH observations of L1498. We derived the distribution of CCH column densities and compared with the H2 column densities inferred from dust emission. We find that while non-LTE intensity ratios of different components of the N=1-0 and N=2-1 lines are present, they are of minor importance and do not impede CCH column density determinations based upon LTE analysis. Moreover, the comparison of our Monte-Carlo calculations with observations suggest that the non-LTE deviations can be qualitatively understood. For L1498, our observations in conjunction with the Monte Carlo code imply a CCH depletion hole of radius 9 x 10^{16} cm similar to that found for other C-containing species. We briefly discuss the significance of the observed CCH abundance distribution. Finally, we used our observations to provide improved estimates for the rest frequencies of all six components of the CCH(1-0) line and seven components of CCH(2-1). Based on these results, we compute improved spectroscopic constants for CCH. We also give a brief discussion of the prospects for measuring magnetic field strengths using CCH.
astro-ph.GA:The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST), with its improved sensitivity relative to previous generation gamma-ray telescopes, is significantly increasing the number of known gamma-ray sources in the sky, including pulsars. In addition to searching for gamma-ray emission from known radio pulsars, it is now possible to successfully perform blind searches for pulsars on the gamma-ray data alone, with the goal of uncovering a new population of potentially radio-quiet (Geminga-like) pulsars. We describe our methods and some recent results from our searches, performed using the time-differencing technique, which have resulted in the discovery of a large number of new gamma-ray pulsars.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the role of supernova (SN)-driven galactic winds in the chemical enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM). Such outflows on galactic scales have their origin in huge star forming regions and expel metal enriched material out of the galaxies into their surroundings as observed, for example, in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. As massive stars in OB-associations explode sequentially, shock waves are driven into the interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy and merge, forming a superbubble (SB). These SBs expand in a direction perpendicular to the disk plane following the density gradient of the ISM. We use the 2D analytical approximation by Kompaneets (1960) to model the expansion of SBs in an exponentially stratified ISM. This is modified in order to describe the sequence of SN-explosions as a time-dependent process taking into account the main-sequence life-time of the SN-progenitors and using an initial mass function to get the number of massive stars per mass interval. The evolution of the bubble in space and time is calculated analytically, from which the onset of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in the shell can be determined. In its further evolution, the shell will break up and high-metallicity gas will be ejected into the halo of the galaxy and even into the ICM. We derive the number of stars needed for blow-out depending on the scale height and density of the ambient medium, as well as the fraction of alpha- and iron peak elements contained in the hot gas. Finally, the amount of metals injected by Milky Way-type galaxies to the ICM is calculated confirming the importance of this enrichment process.
astro-ph.GA:Using high-resolution, two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate nonlinear gravitational responses of gas to, and the resulting drag force on, a very massive perturber M_p moving at velocity V_p through a uniform gaseous medium of adiabatic sound speed a_0. We model the perturber as a Plummer potential with softening radius r_s, and run various models with differing A=GM_p/(a_0^2 r_s) and M=V_p/a_0 by imposing cylindrical symmetry with respect to the line of perturber motion. For supersonic cases, a massive perturber quickly develops nonlinear flows that produce a detached bow shock and a vortex ring, which is unlike in the linear cases where Mach cones are bounded by low-amplitude Mach waves. The flows behind the shock are initially non-steady, displaying quasi-periodic, overstable oscillations of the vortex ring and the shock. The vortex ring is eventually shed downstream and the flows evolve toward a quasi-steady state where the density wake near the perturber is in near hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the detached shock distance $\delta$ and the nonlinear drag force F depend solely on \eta=A/(M^2-1) such that \delta/r_s=\eta and F/F_{lin}=(\eta/2)^{-0.45} for \eta>2, where F_{lin} is the linear drag force of Ostriker (1999). The reduction of F compared with F_{lin} is caused by front-back symmetry in the nonlinear density wakes. In subsonic cases, the flows without involving a shock do not readily reach a steady state. Nevertheless, the subsonic density wake near a perturber is close to being hydrostatic, resulting in the drag force similar to the linear case. Our results suggest that dynamical friction of a very massive object as in a merger of black holes near a galaxy center will take considerably longer than the linear prediction.
astro-ph.GA:One of the key problems in star formation research is to determine the role of magnetic fields. Starting from the atomic inter-cloud medium (ICM) which has density nH ~ 1 per cubic cm, gas must accumulate from a volume several hundred pc across in order to form a typical molecular cloud. Star formation usually occurs in cloud cores, which have linear sizes below 1 pc and densities nH2 > 10^5 per cubic cm. With current technologies, it is hard to probe magnetic fields at scales lying between the accumulation length and the size of cloud cores, a range corresponds to many levels of turbulent eddy cascade, and many orders of magnitude of density amplification. For field directions detected from the two extremes, however, we show here that a significant correlation is found. Comparing this result with molecular cloud simulations, only the sub-Alfvenic cases result in field orientations consistent with our observations.
astro-ph.GA:Dissipationless (gas-free or "dry") mergers have been suggested to play a major role in the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies, particularly in growing their mass and size without altering their stellar populations. We perform a new test of the dry merger hypothesis by comparing N-body simulations of realistic systems to empirical constraints provided by recent studies of lens early-type galaxies. We find that major and minor dry mergers: i) preserve the nearly isothermal structure of early-type galaxies within the observed scatter; ii) do not change more than the observed scatter the ratio between total mass M and "virial" mass R_e*sigma/2G (where R_e is the half-light radius and sigma the projected velocity dispersion); iii) increase strongly galaxy sizes [as M^(0.85+/-0.17)] and weakly velocity dispersions [as M^(0.06+/-0.08)] with mass, thus moving galaxies away from the local observed M-R_e and M-sigma relations; iv) introduce substantial scatter in the M-R_e and M-sigma relations. Our findings imply that, unless there is a high degree of fine tuning of the mix of progenitors and types of interactions, present-day massive early-type galaxies cannot have assembled more than ~50% of their mass, and increased their size by more than a factor ~1.8, via dry merging.
astro-ph.GA:The color magnitude diagram (CMD) of NGC 1851 presents two subgiant branches (SGB), probably due the presence of two populations differing in total CNO content. We test the idea that a difference in total CNO may simulate an age difference when comparing the CMD of clusters to derive relative ages. We compare NGC 1851 with NGC 6121 (M4), a cluster of very similar [Fe/H]. We find that, with a suitable shift of the CMDs that brings the two red horizontal branches at the same magnitude level, the unevolved main sequence and red giant branch match, but the SGB of NGC 6121 and its red giant branch "bump" are fainter than in NGC 1851. In particular, the SGB of NGC 6121 is even slightly fainter than the the faint SGB in NGC 1851. Both these features can be explained if the total CNO in NGC 6121 is larger than that in NGC 1851, even if the two clusters are coeval. We conclude by warning that different initial C+N+O abundances between two clusters, otherwise similar in metallicity and age, may lead to differences in the turnoff morphology that can be easily attributed to an age difference.
astro-ph.GA:The inner boundary of protoplanetary discs is structured by the dramatic opacity changes at the transition from the dust-containing to a dust-free zone. This paper explores the variety and limits of inner rim structures in passively heated dusty discs. For this study, we implemented detailed sublimation physics in a fast Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. We show that the inner rim in dusty discs is not an infinitely sharp wall but a diffuse region which may be narrow or wide. Furthermore, high surface densities and large silicate grains as well as iron and corundum grains decrease the rim radius, from a 2.2AU radius for small silicates around a 47 Solar luminosity Herbig Ae star typically to 0.4AU and as close as 0.2AU. A passive disc with grain growth and a diverse dust composition must thus have a small inner rim radius. Finally, an analytical expression is presented for the rim location as a function of dust, disc and stellar properties.
astro-ph.GA:We present Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper observations of ionized gas in the Smith Cloud, a high velocity cloud which Lockman et al. have recently suggested is interacting with the Galactic disk. Our H-alpha map shows the brightest H-alpha emission, 0.43 \pm 0.04 R, coincident with the brightest H I, while slightly fainter H-alpha emission (0.25 \pm 0.02 R) is observed in a region with H I intensities < 0.1 times as bright as the brightest H I. We derive an ionized mass of \gtrsim 3 \times 10^6 M_\odot, comparable to the H I mass, with the H^+ mass spread over a considerably larger area than the H I. An estimated Galactic extinction correction could adjust these values upwards by 40 %. H-alpha and [S II] line widths towards the region of brightest emission constrain the electron temperature of the gas to be between 8000 K and 23000 K. A detection of [N II] \lambda 6583 in the same direction with a line ratio [N II] / H-alpha = 0.32 \pm 0.05 constrains the metallicity of the cloud: for typical photoionization temperatures of 8000-12000 K, the nitrogen abundance is 0.15-0.44 times solar. These results lend further support to the claim that the Smith Cloud is new material accreting onto the Galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:The most evident features of colour-magnitude diagrams of galaxies are the red sequence of quiescent galaxies, extending up to the brightest elliptical galaxies, and the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies, which is truncated at a luminosity L~L*. The truncation of the blue cloud indicates that in the most massive systems star formation must be quenched. For this to happen the virial-temperature galactic gas must be kept hot and any accreted cold gas must be heated. The elimination of accreted cold gas can be due to thermal evaporation by the hot interstellar medium, which in turn is prevented from cooling by feedback from active galactic nuclei.
astro-ph.GA:We seek to obtain a picture of the interstellar magnetic field in the Galactic center region that is as clear and complete as possible.   To that end, we review the observational knowledge that has built up over the past 25 years on interstellar magnetic fields within ~ 200 pc of the Galactic center. We then critically discuss the various theoretical interpretations and scenarios proposed to explain the existing observations. We also study the possible connections with the general Galactic magnetic field and describe the observational situation in external galaxies.   We propose a coherent picture of the magnetic field near the Galactic center, which reconciles some of the seemingly divergent views and which best accounts for the vast body of observations. Our main conclusions are the following. In the diffuse intercloud medium, the large-scale magnetic field is approximately poloidal and its value is generally close to equipartition with cosmic rays (~ 10 microG), except in localized filaments where the field strength can reach ~ 1 mG. In dense interstellar clouds, the magnetic field is approximately horizontal and its value is typically ~ 1 mG.
astro-ph.GA:Empirical birthrate estimates for pulsar binaries depend on the fraction of sky subtended by the pulsar beam: the pulsar beaming fraction. This fraction depends on both the pulsar's opening angle and the misalignment angle between its spin and magnetic axes. Previous estimates use the average value for only two pulsars, i.e. PSRs B1913+16 and B1534+12. We explore how birthrate predictions depend on assumptions about opening angle and alignment, using empirically-motivated distributions to define an effective beaming correction factor, f_{b,eff}. For most known pulsars, we expect f_{b,eff} to be less than 6. We also calculate f_{b,eff} for PSRs J0737-3039A and J1141-6545, applying the currently available constraints for their beam geometry. Our median posterior birthrate predictions for tight PSR-NS binaries, wide PSR-NS binaries, and tight PSR-WD binaries are 89/Myr, 0.84/Myr, and 34/Myr, respectively. For pulsars with spin period between 10 ms and 100 ms, we marginalized our posterior birthrate distribution P(R) over a range of plausible beaming correction factors. Our predictions are robust, changing little between several alternative misalignment angle distribution models. [ABRIDGED]
astro-ph.GA:The Galaxy's stellar halo seems to be a tangle of disrupted systems that have been tidally stretched out into streams. Each stream approximately delineates an orbit in the Galactic force-field. In the first paper in this series we showed that all six phase-space coordinates of each point on an orbit can be reconstructed from the orbit's path across the sky and measurements of the line-of-sight velocity along the orbit. In this paper we complement this finding by showing that the orbit can also be reconstructed if we know proper motions along the orbit rather than the radial velocities. We also show that accurate proper motions of stream stars would enable distances to be determined to points on the stream that are independent of any assumption about the Galaxy's gravitational potential. Such "Galactic parallaxes" would be as fundamental as conventional trigonometric parallaxes, but measureable to distances ~70 times further.
astro-ph.GA:In this work we present scanning Fabry-Perot H$\alpha$ observations of the isolated interacting galaxy pair NGC 5278/79 obtained with the PUMA Fabry-Perot interferometer. We derived velocity fields, various kinematic parameters and rotation curves for both galaxies. Our kinematical results together with the fact that dust lanes have been detected in both galaxies, as well as the analysis of surface brightness profiles along the minor axis, allowed us to determine that both components of the interacting pair are trailing spirals.
astro-ph.GA:We present new observations of the nuclear star cluster in the central parsec of the Galaxy with the adaptive optics assisted, integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the ESO/VLT. Our work allows the spectroscopic detection of early and late type stars to m_K >= 16, more than 2 magnitudes deeper than our previous data sets. Our observations result in a total sample of 177 bona fide early-type stars. We find that most of these Wolf Rayet (WR), O- and B- stars reside in two strongly warped disks between 0.8" and 12" from SgrA*, as well as a central compact concentration (the S-star cluster) centered on SgrA*. The later type B stars (m_K>15) in the radial interval between 0.8" and 12" seem to be in a more isotropic distribution outside the disks. The observed dearth of late type stars in the central few arcseconds is puzzling, even when allowing for stellar collisions. The stellar mass function of the disk stars is extremely top heavy with a best fit power law of dN/dm ~ m^(-0.45+/-0.3). Since at least the WR/O-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event ~6 Myrs ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (IMF). The mass functions of the S-stars inside 0.8" and of the early-type stars at distances beyond 12" are compatible with a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF (best fit power law of dN/dm ~ m^(-2.15+/-0.3)).
astro-ph.GA:Thermodynamics play an important role in determining the way a protostellar disc fragments to form planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We explore the effect that different treatments of radiative transfer have in simulations of fragmenting discs. Three prescriptions for the radiative transfer are used, (i) the diffusion approximation of Stamatellos et al., (ii) the barotropic equation of state (EOS) of Goodwin et al., and (iii) the barotropic EOS of Bate et al. The barotropic approximations capture the general evolution of the density and temperature at the centre of each proto-fragment but (i) they do not make any adjustments the particular circumstances of a proto-fragment forming in the disc, and (ii) they do not take into account thermal inertia effects that are important for fast-forming proto-fragments in the outer disc region. As a result, the number of fragments formed in the disc and their properties are different, when a barotropic EOS is used. This is important not only for disc studies but also for simulations of collapsing turbulent clouds, as in many cases in such simulations stars form with discs that subsequently fragment. We also examine the difference in the way proto-fragments condense out in the disc at different distances from the central star using the diffusion approximation and following the collapse of each proto-fragment until the formation of the second core (~10^{-3} g/cm3). We find that proto-fragments forming closer to the central star tend to form earlier and evolve faster from the first to the second core than proto-fragments forming in the outer disc region. The former have a large pool of material in the inner disc region that they can accrete from and grow in mass. The latter accrete more slowly and they are hotter because they generally form in a quick abrupt event.
astro-ph.GA:The characteristic properties of blazars (rapid variability, strong polarization, high brightness) are widely attributed to a powerful relativistic jet oriented close to our line of sight. Despite the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) being strongly jet-dominated, a "big blue bump" has been recently detected in sources known as flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). These new data provide a unique opportunity to observationally test coupled jet-disc accretion models in these extreme sources. In particular, as energy and angular momentum can be extracted by a jet magnetically coupled to the accretion disc, the thermal disc emission spectrum may be modified from that predicted by the standard model for disc accretion. We compare the theoretically predicted jet-modified accretion disc spectra against the new observations of the "big blue bump" in FSRQs. We find mass accretion rates that are higher, typically by a factor of two, than predicted by standard accretion disc theory. Furthermore, our results predict that the high redshift blazars PKS 0836+710, PKS 2149-307, B2 0743+25 and PKS 0537-286 may be predominantly powered by a low or moderate spin (a < 0.6) black hole with high mass accretion rates mdot_a ~ 50 - 200 msol/yr, while 3C 273 harbours a rapidly spinning black hole (a = 0.97) with mdot_a ~ 20 msol/yr. We also find that the black hole masses in these high redshift sources must be > 5 * 10^9 msol.
astro-ph.GA:In previous studies we identified two classes of starless cores, thermally subcritical and supercritical, distinguished by different dynamical behavior and internal structure. Here we study the evolution of the dynamically-unstable, thermally-supercritical cores by means of a numerical hydrodynamic simulation that includes radiative equilibrium and simple molecular chemistry. We use our non-LTE radiative transfer code MOLLIE to predict observable CO and N2H+ line spectra, including the non-LTE hyperfine ratios of N2H+, during the contraction. These are compared against observations of the starless core L1544.
astro-ph.GA:We have obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra for 899 F and G dwarf stars in the Solar neighbourhood. The stars were selected on the basis of their kinematic properties to trace the thin and thick discs, the Hercules stream, and the metal-rich stellar halo. A significant number of stars with kinematic properties 'in between' the thin and thick discs were also observed in order to in greater detail investigate the dichotomy of the Galactic disc. All stars have been homogeneously analysed, using the exact same methods, atomic data, model atmospheres, etc., and also truly differentially to the Sun. Hence, the sample is likely to be free from internal errors, allowing us to, in a multi-dimensional space consisting of detailed elemental abundances, stellar ages, and the full three-dimensional space velocities, reveal very small differences between the stellar populations.
astro-ph.GA:We present an attempt to explain the diffuse H_alpha emission of a face-on galaxy M 51 with the ``standard'' photoionization model, in which the Lyman continuum (Lyc) escaping from H II regions propagates large distances into the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The diffuse H_alpha emission of M 51 is analyzed using thin slab models and exponential disk models in the context of the ``on-the-spot'' approximation. The scale height of the ionized gas needed to explain the diffuse H_alpha emission with the scenario is found to be of the order of ~ 1-2 kpc, consistent with those of our Galaxy and edge-on galaxies. The model also provides a vertical profile, when the galaxy is viewed edge-on, consisting of two-exponential components. However, it is found that an incredibly low absorption coefficient of kappa_0 ~ 0.4-0.8 kpc^{-1} at the galactic plane, or, equivalently, an effective cross-section as low as sigma_eff ~ 10^{-5} of the photoionization cross-section at 912A is required to allow the stellar Lyc photons to travel through the H I disk. Such a low absorption coefficient is out of accord with the properties of the ISM. Furthermore, we found that even the model that has the DIG phase only and no H I gas phase shows highly concentrated H_alpha emissions around H II regions, and can account for only < 26% of the H_alpha luminosity of the DIG. This result places a strong constraint on the ionizing source of the DIG. We also report that the H_alpha intensity distribution functions not only of the DIG, but also of H II regions in M 51, appear to be lognormal.
astro-ph.GA:Context: Globular clusters (GCs) in the outer halo are important probes of the composition and origin of the Galactic stellar halo.   Aims: We derive chemical element abundance ratios in red giants belonging to the remote (R~90 kpc) GC Pal 3 and compare our measurements to those for red giant stars in both inner and outer halo GCs.   Methods: From high-resolution spectroscopy of four red giants, obtained with the Magellan/MIKE spectrograph at moderately high S/N, we derive chemical abundances for 25 alpha-, iron peak-, and neutron-capture elements. These abundance ratios are confirmed by co-adding low S/N HIRES spectra of 19 stars along the red giant branch.   Results: Pal 3 shows alpha-enhanced abundance patterns, and also its Fe-peak and neutron-capture element ratios, are fully compatible with those found in halo field stars and representative inner halo GCs of the same metallicity (such as M 13). The heavy elements in Pal 3 appear to be governed by r-process nucleosyn-thesis. Our limited sample does not show any significant star-to-star abundance variations in this cluster, although a weak Na-O anti-correlation cannot be ruled out by the present data.   Conclusions: Pal 3 thus appears as an archetypical GC with abundance ratios dissimilar to dwarf spheroidal stars, ruling out a direct connection to such external systems. This conclusion is underscored by the lack of significant abundance spreads in this GC, in contrast to the broad abundance distributions seen in the dwarf galaxies. Pal 3 appears to have evolved chemically coeval with the majority of GCs belonging to Galactic inner and outer halo, experiencing a similar enrichment history.
astro-ph.GA:Using a source selection biased towards high mass star forming regions, we used a Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) code to calculate the H2 densities and CS column densities for a sample of Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) 8 micron infrared dark cores. Our average H2 density and CS column density were 1.14 x 10e6 cm-3 and 1.21 x 10e13 cm-2 respectively. In addition, we have calculated the Jeans mass and Virial mass for each core to get a better understanding of their gravitational stability. We found that core masses calculated from observations of N2H+ J = 1-0 and C18O J = 1-0 by Ragan et al. 2006 (Paper 1) were sufficient for collapse, though most regions are likely to form protoclusters. We have explored the star-forming properties of the molecular gas within our sample and find some diversity which extends the range of infrared dark clouds from very the massive clouds that will create large clusters, to clouds that are similar to some of our local counterparts (e.g. Serpens, Ophiuchus).
astro-ph.GA:We consider the integral light polarization from optically thick accretion disks. Basic mechanism is the multiple light scattering on free electrons (Milne's problem) in magnetized atmosphere. The Faraday rotation of the polarization plane changes both the value of integral polarization degree $p$ and the position angle $\chi $. Besides, the characteristic spectra of these values appear. We are testing the known relation between magnetic field of black hole at the horizon $B_{BH}$ and its mass $M_{BH}$, and the usual power-law distribution inside the accretion disk. The formulae for $p(\lambda)$ and $\chi(\lambda)$ depend on a number of parameters describing the particular dependence of magnetic field in accretion disk (the index of power-law distribution, the spin of the black hole, etc.). Comparison of our theoretical values of $p$ and $\chi $ with observed polarization can help us to choice more realistic values of parameters if the accretion disk mechanism gives the main contribution to the observed integral polarization. The main content is connected with estimation of validity of the relation between $B_{BH}$ and $M_{BH}$. We found for the AGN NGC 4258 that such procedure does not confirm the mentioned correlation between magnetic field and mass of black hole.
astro-ph.GA:We present elemental abundances of 13 microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge, which constitute the largest sample to date. We show that these stars span the full range of metallicity from Fe/H=-0.8 to +0.4, and that they follow well-defined abundance trends, coincident with those of the Galactic thick disc.
astro-ph.GA:The next generation near- and mid-infrared Galactic surveys will yield a large number of new highly obscured star clusters. Detailed characterization of these new objects with spectroscopy is time-consuming. Diagnostic tools that will be able to characterize clusters based only on the available photometry will be needed to study large samples of the newly found objects. The brightness difference between the red clump and the main-sequence turn-off point have been used as a model-independent age calibrator for clusters with ages from a few 10$^8$ to 10$^{10}$ yr in the optical. Here we apply for the first time the method in the near-infrared. We calibrated this difference in $K$-band, which is likely to be available for obscured clusters, and we apply it to a number of test clusters with photometry comparable to the one that will be yielded by the current or near-future surveys. The new calibration yields reliable ages over the range of ages for which the red clump is present in clusters. The slope of the relation is smoother than that of the corresponding $V$-band relation, reducing the uncertainty in the age determinations with respect to the optical ones.
astro-ph.GA:We present a simple result in which the distance gradient along a stream can be used to derive the transverse velocity (i.e. proper motion) along it, if the line-of-sight velocity is also known. We show its application to a mock orbit to illustrate its validity and usage. For less extended objects, such as globular clusters and satellite galaxies being tidally disrupted, the same result can be applied in its small-angle approximation. The procedure does not rely on energy or angular momentum conservation and hence does not require a Galactic model in order to deduce the local velocity vector of the stream.
astro-ph.GA:We study electromagnetic streaming instabilities in thermal viscous regions of rotating astrophysical objects, such as, protostellar and protoplanetary magnetized accretion disks, molecular clouds, their cores, and elephant trunks. The obtained results can also be applied to any regions of interstellar medium, where different equilibrium velocities between charged species can arise. We consider a weakly and highly ionized three-component plasma consisting of neutrals and magnetized electrons and ions. The vertical perturbations along the background magnetic field are investigated. The effect of perturbation of collisional frequencies due to density perturbations of species is taken into account. The growth rates of perturbations are found in a wide region of wave number spectrum for media, where the thermal pressure is larger than the magnetic pressure. It is shown that in cases of strong collisional coupling of neutrals with ions the contribution of the viscosity is negligible.
astro-ph.GA:We present a series of simulations of turbulent stratified protostellar discs with the goal of characterizing the settling of dust throughout a minimum-mass solar nebula. We compare the evolution of both compact spherical grains, as well as highly fractal grains. Our simulations use a shearing-box formulation to study the evolution of dust grains locally within the disc, and collectively our simulations span the entire extent of a typical accretion disc. The dust is stirred by gas that undergoes MRI-driven turbulence. This establishes a steady state scale height for the dust that is different for dust of different sizes. This sedimentation of dust is an important first step in planet formation and we predict that ALMA should be able to observationally verify its existence. When significant sedimentation occurs, the dust will participate in a streaming instability that significantly enhances the dust density. We show that the streaming instability is pervasive in the outer disc. We characterize the scale heights of dust whose size ranges from a few microns to a few centimeters. We find that for spherical grains, a power-law relationship develops for the scale height with grain size, with a slope that is slightly steeper than -1/2. The sedimentation is strongest in the outer disc and increases for large grains. The results presented here show that direct measurements of grain settling can be made by ALMA and we present favorable conditions for observability. The streaming instability should also be directly observable and we provide conditions for directly observing it. We calculate collision rates and growth rates for the dust grains in our simulations of various sizes colliding with other grains, and find that these rates are significantly enhanced through the density enhancement arising from the streaming instability.
astro-ph.GA:We present a photometric study of the neglected open cluster Berkeley 53. We derived its fundamental parameters, such as the age, the interstellar reddening, and the distance from the Sun, based on BV photometry combined with near-infrared JHK data. The structure and the mass function of the cluster were also studied and the total number of members and the total mass were estimated. The cluster was found to be a rich and massive stellar system, located in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way, 3.1+/-0.1 kpc from the Sun. Its age exceeds 1 Gy but it seems to be very young in the context of its dynamical evolution. The analysis of the two-color diagrams and color-magnitude diagrams indicates that the cluster is significantly reddened. However, both methods resulted in different values of E(B-V), i.e. 1.21+/-0.04 and 1.52+/-0.01, respectively. This discrepancy suggests the presence of an abnormal interstellar extinction law toward the cluster.
astro-ph.GA:In the context of exploring mass distributions of dark matter haloes in giant ellipticals, we extend the analysis carried out Merrifield and Kuijken (1998) for stellar line profiles of shells created in nearly radial mergers of galaxies. We show that line-of-sight velocity distributions are more complex than previously predicted. We simulate shell formation and analyze the detectability of spectroscopic signatures of shells after convolution with spectral PSFs.
astro-ph.GA:Galaxy interactions are a common phenomenon in clusters of galaxies. Especially major mergers are of particular importance, because they can change the morphological type of galaxies. They have an impact on the mass function of galaxies and they trigger star formation - the main driver of the Galactic Matter Cycle. Therefore, we conducted a study of major mergers by means of a multi-phase ISM code. This code is based on a TREE-SPH-code combined with a sticky particle method allowing for star formation controlled by the properties of a multi-phase ISM. This is in contrast to the usually implemented Schmidt law depending mainly on the gas density. Previously, this code was used on isolated galaxies. Since our star formation recipe is not restricted to a special type of galaxy, it is interesting to apply it to interacting galaxies, too. Our study on major mergers includes a research of global properties of the interacting system, namely the star formation rate and the star formation efficiency, the evaporation and condensation rates, as well as the mass exchange of distinct components, namely stars, diffuse ISM, and clouds. Investigating these properties provides insight to interrelations between various physical processes. The results indicate that the star formation efficiency as well as the evaporation and condensation rates are influenced by the interaction.
astro-ph.GA:We present an analysis of the active galaxy SDSS J131642.90+175332.5, which is remarkable because all of its narrow emission lines are double-peaked, and because it additionally shows an extra broad component (FHWM ~ 1400 km/s) in most of its forbidden lines, peaking in between the two narrow systems. The peaks of the two narrow systems are separated by 400--500 km/s in velocity space. The spectral characteristics of double-peaked [O III] emission have previously been interpreted as a signature of dual or binary active galactic nuclei (AGNs), among other models. In the context of the binary scenario, SDSS J131642.90+175332.5 is a particularly good candidate because not just one line but all of its emission lines are double-peaked. However, we also discuss a number of other scenarios which can potentially account for double-peaked narrow emission lines, including projection effects, a two-sided outflow, jet-cloud interactions, special narrow-line region (NLR) geometries (disks, bars, or inner spirals), and a galaxy merger with only one AGN illuminating two NLRs. We argue that the similarity of the emission-line ratios in both systems, and the presence of the very unusual broad component at intermediate velocity, makes a close pair of unrelated AGNs unlikely, and rather argues for processes in a single galaxy or merger. We describe future observations which can distinguish between these remaining possibilities.
astro-ph.GA:Aims. Neutron stars (NSs) produced in the Milky Way are supposedly ten to the eighth - ten to the ninth, of which only $\sim 2 \times 10^{3}$ are observed. Constraining the phase space distribution of NSs may help to characterize the yet undetected population of stellar remnants. Methods. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of NS orbits, under different assumptions concerning the Galactic potential and the distribution of progenitors and birth velocities. We study the resulting phase space distributions, focusing on the statistical properties of the NS populations in the disk and in the solar neighbourhood. Results. It is shown that $\sim 80$ percent of NSs are in bound orbits. The fraction of NSs located in a disk of radius 20 kpc and width 0.4 kpc is $\lesssim 20$ percent. Therefore the majority of NSs populate the halo. Fits for the surface density of the disk, the distribution of heights on the Galactic plane and the velocity distribution of the disk, are given. We also provide sky maps of the projected number density in heliocentric Galactic coordinates (l, b). Our results are compared with previous ones reported in the literature. Conclusions. Obvious applications of our modelling are in the revisiting of accretion luminosities of old isolated NSs, the issue of the observability of the nearest NS and the NS optical depth for microlensing events. These will be the scope of further studies.
astro-ph.GA:Our aim is to provide as clean and as complete a sample as possible of red giant branch stars that are members of the Hercules dSph galaxy. With this sample we explore the velocity dispersion and the metallicity of the system. Stromgren photometry and multi-fibre spectroscopy are combined to provide information about the evolutionary state of the stars (via the Stromgren c_1 index) and their radial velocities. Based on this information we have selected a clean sample of red giant branch stars, and show that foreground contamination by Milky Way dwarf stars can greatly distort the results. Our final sample consists of 28 red giant branch stars in the Hercules dSph galaxy. Based on these stars we find a mean photometric metallicity of -2.35 dex which is consistent with previous studies. We find evidence for an abundance spread. Using those stars for which we have determined radial velocities we find a systemic velocity of 45.2 km/s with a dispersion of 3.72 km/s, this is lower than values found in the literature. Furthermore we identify the horizontal branch and estimate the mean magnitude of the horizontal branch of the Hercules dSph galaxy to be V_0=21.17, which corresponds to a distance of 147 kpc. We have shown that a proper cleaning of the sample results in a smaller value for the velocity dispersion of the system. This has implications for galaxy properties derived from such velocity dispersions.
astro-ph.GA:We observed six fields of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with the Advanced Camera for Survey on board the Hubble Space Telescope in the F555W and F814W filters. These fields sample regions characterized by very different star and gas densities, and, possibly, by different evolutionary histories. We find that the SMC was already forming stars ~12 Gyr ago, even if the lack of a clear horizontal branch suggests that in the first few billion years the star formation activity was low. Within the uncertainties of our two-band photometry, we find evidence of a radial variation in chemical enrichment, with the SMC outskirts characterized by lower metallicity than the central zones.   From our CMDs we also infer that the SMC formed stars over a long interval of time until ~2-3 Gyr ago. After a period of modest activity, star formation increased again in the recent past, especially in the bar and the wing of the SMC, where we see an enhancement in the star-formation activity starting from ~500 Myr ago. The inhomogeneous distribution of stars younger than ~100 Myr indicates that recent star formation has mainly developed locally.
astro-ph.GA:We present our analysis of a fully sampled, high resolution dust extinction map of the Barnard 59 complex in the Pipe Nebula. The map was constructed with the infrared color excess technique applied to a photometric catalog that combines data from both ground and space based observations. The map resolves for the first time the high density center of the main core in the complex, that is associated with the formation of a small cluster of stars. We found that the central core in Barnard 59 shows an unexpected lack of significant substructure consisting of only two significant fragments. Overall, the material appears to be consistent with being a single, large core with a density profile that can be well fit by a King model. A series of NH$_3$ pointed observations towards the high column density center of the core appear to show that the core is still thermally dominated, with sub-sonic non-thermal motions. The stars in the cluster could be providing feedback to support the core against collapse, but the relatively narrow radio lines suggest that an additional source of support, for example a magnetic field, may be required to stabilize the core. Outside the central core our observations reveal the structure of peripheral cores and resolve an extended filament into a handful of significant substructures whose spacing and masses appear to be consistent with Jeans fragmentation.
astro-ph.GA:The M51 galaxy is one of best examples of grand design structure in galaxies. The most likely origin of the spiral arms in M51 is the ongoing interaction with NGC 5195. Here we report recent calculations which model the orbit of M51 and NGC 5195. These calculations, which for the first time focus on the gas dynamics, are able to reproduce even detailed features in M51, as well as demonstrate the nature of the spiral structure of M51.
astro-ph.GA:NGC 6522 has been the first metal-poor globular cluster identified in the bulge by W. Baade. Despite its importance, very few high resolution abundance analyses of stars in this cluster are available in the literature. The bulge metal-poor clusters may be important tracers of the early chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. The main purpose of this study is the determination of metallicity and elemental ratios in individual stars of NGC 6522. High resolution spectra of 8 giants of the bulge globular cluster NGC 6522 were obtained at the 8m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope with the FLAMES+GIRAFFE spectrograph. Multiband V,I,J,Ks} photometry was used to derive effective temperatures as reference values. Spectroscopic parameters are derived from FeI and FeII lines, and adopted for the derivation of abundance ratios. The present analysis provides a metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.0+-0.2. The alpha-elements Oxygen, Magnesium and Silicon show [O/Fe]=+0.4, [Mg/Fe]=[Si/Fe]= +0.25, whereas Calcium and Titanium show shallower ratios of [Ca/Fe]=[Ti/Fe]=+0.15. The neutron-capture r-process element Europium appears to be overabundant by [Eu/Fe]=+0.4. The neutron-capture s-elements La and Ba are enhanced by [La/Fe]=+0.35 and [Ba/Fe]=+0.5. The large internal errors, indicating the large star-to-star variationin the Ba and Eu abundances, are also discussed. The moderate metallicity combined to a blue Horizontal Branch (BHB), are characteristics similar to those of HP~1 and NGC 6558, pointing to a population of very old globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. Also, the abundance ratios in NGC 6522 resemble those in HP 1 and NGC 6558. The ultimate conclusion is that the bulge is old, and went through an early prompt chemical enrichment.
astro-ph.GA:We report on a search for new wide halo binary stars in SDSS Stripe 82. A list of new halo wide binary candidates which satisfy common proper motion and photometric constraints is provided. The projected separations of the sample lie between 0.007-0.25pc. Although the sample is not large enough to improve constraints on dark matter in the halo, we find the wide binary angular separation function is broadly consistent with past work. We discuss the significance of the new sample for a number of astrophysical applications, including as a testbed for ideas about wide binary formation. For the subset of candidates which have radial velocity information we make use of integrals of motion to investigate one such scheme in which the origin of Galactic wide binaries is associated with the accretion/disruption of stellar systems in the Galaxy. Additional spectroscopic observations of these candidate binaries will strengthen their usefulness in many of these respects. Based on our search experience in Stripe 82 we estimate that the upcoming Pan-STARRS survey will increase the sample size of wide halo binaries by over an order of magnitude.
astro-ph.GA:Formation of interstellar clouds as a consequence of thermal instability is studied using two-dimensional two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We consider the situation of converging, supersonic flows of warm neutral medium in the interstellar medium that generate a shocked slab of thermally unstable gas in which clouds form. We found, as speculated in paper I, that in the shocked slab magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure and the thermal instability grows in the isochorically cooling, thermally unstable slab that leads formation of HI clouds whose number density is typically n < 100 cm^-3, even if the angle between magnetic field and converging flows is small. We also found that even if there is a large dispersion of magnetic field, evolution of the shocked slab is essentially determined by the angle between the mean magnetic field and converging flows. Thus, the direct formation of molecular clouds by piling up warm neutral medium does not seem a typical molecular cloud formation process, unless the direction of supersonic converging flows is biased to the orientation of mean magnetic field by some mechanism. However, when the angle is small, the HI shell generated as a result of converging flows is massive and possibly evolves into molecular clouds, provided gas in the massive HI shell is piled up again along the magnetic field line. We expect that another subsequent shock wave can pile up again the gas of the massive shell and produce a larger cloud. We thus emphasize the importance of multiple episodes of converging flows, as a typical formation process of molecular clouds.
astro-ph.GA:We report observations of the eclipsing classical nova V368 Aql (Nova Aql 1936 No. 2). These data reveal that the orbital period previously published by Diaz & Bruch is an alias of the true orbital period. A total of 14 eclipses (12 complete and 2 partial) over 25 nights of observation have established that the orbital period of V368 Aql is 0.6905093(1) d (16.57 hr), which is roughly twice the previously published period. With its revised orbital period, V368 Aql now joins other nova systems with periods in excess of 0.5 day that dominate the long end of the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variables.
astro-ph.GA:With the goal to refine modelling of shell galaxies and the use of shells to probe the merger history, we develop a new method for implementing dynamical friction in test-particle simulations of radial minor mergers. The friction is combined with a gradual decay of the dwarf galaxy. The coupling of both effects can considerably redistribute positions and luminosities of shells; neglecting them can lead to significant errors in attempts to date the merger.
astro-ph.GA:We have obtained high-resolution spectra and carried out a detailed elemental abundance analysis for a new sample of 899 F and G dwarf stars in the Solar neighbourhood. The results allow us to, in a multi-dimensional space consisting of stellar ages, detailed elemental abundances, and full kinematic information for the stars, study and trace their respective origins. Here we briefly address selection criteria and discuss how to define a thick disc star. The results are discussed in the context of galaxy formation.
astro-ph.GA:In the framework of microlensing searches towards the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we discuss the results presented by the OGLE collaboration for their OGLE-II campaign \citep{lukas09}. We evaluate the optical depth, the duration and the expected rate of events for the different possible lens populations: both luminous, dominated by the LMC self lensing, and "dark", the would be compact halo objects (MACHOs) belonging to either the Galactic or to the LMC halo. The OGLE-II observational results, 2 microlensing candidate events located in the LMC bar region with duration of 24.2 and 57.2 days, compare well with the expected signal from the luminous lens populations: $n_\mathrm{exp}=1.5$, with typical duration, for LMC self lensing, of about 50 days. Because of the small statistics at disposal, however, the conclusions that can be drawn as for the halo mass fraction, $f$, in form of compact halo objects are not too severe. By means of a likelihood analysis we find an \emph{upper} limit for $f$, at 95% confidence level, of about 15% in the mass range $(10^{-2}-10^{-1}) \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and 26% for $0.5 \mathrm{M}_\odot$.
astro-ph.GA:Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are dark clouds seen in silhouette in mid-infrared surveys. They are thought to be the birthplace of massive stars, yet remarkably little information exists on the properties of the population as a whole (e.g. mass spectrum, spatial distribution). Genetic forward modelling is used along with the Two Micron All Sky Survey and the Besancon Galactic model to deduce the three dimensional distribution of interstellar extinction towards previously identified IRDC candidates. This derived dust distribution can then be used to determine the distance and mass of IRDCs, independently of kinematic models of the Milky Way. Along a line of sight that crosses an IRDC, the extinction is seen to rise sharply at the distance of the cloud. Assuming a dust to gas ratio, the total mass of the cloud can be estimated. The method has been successfully applied to 1259 IRDCs, including over 1000 for which no distance or mass estimate currently exists. The IRDCs are seen to lie preferentially along the spiral arms and in the molecular ring of the Milky Way, reinforcing the idea that they are the birthplace of massive stars. Also, their mass spectrum is seen to follow a power law with an index of -1.75 +/- 0.06, steeper than giant molecular clouds in the inner Galaxy, but comparable to clumps in GMCs. This slope suggests that the IRDCs detected using the present method are not gravitationally bound, but are rather the result of density fluctuations induced by turbulence.
astro-ph.GA:We report the first detailed chemical abundances for 5 globular clusters (GCs) in M31 from high-resolution (R ~ 25,000) spectroscopy of their integrated light. These GCs are the first in a larger set of clusters observed as part of an ongoing project to study the formation history of M31 and its globular cluster population. The data presented here were obtained with the HIRES echelle spectrograph on the Keck I telescope, and are analyzed using a new integrated light spectra analysis method that we have developed. In these clusters, we measure abundances for Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Y, and Ba, ages >10 Gyrs, and a range in [Fe/H] of -0.9 to -2.2. As is typical of Milky Way GCs, we find these M31 GCs to be enhanced in the alpha-elements Ca, Si, and Ti relative to Fe. We also find [Mg/Fe] to be low relative to other [alpha/Fe], and [Al/Fe] to be enhanced in the integrated light abundances. These results imply that abundances of Mg, Al (and likely O, Na) recovered from integrated light do display the inter- and intra-cluster abundance variations seen in individual Milky Way GC stars, and that special care should be taken in the future in interpreting low or high resolution integrated light abundances of globular clusters that are based on Mg-dominated absorption features. Fe-peak and the neutron-capture elements Ba and Y also follow Milky Way abundance trends. We also present high-precision velocity dispersion measurements for all 5 M31 GCs, as well as independent constraints on the reddening toward the clusters from our analysis.
astro-ph.GA:We present observations of CH3CN (12-11) emission at a resolution of 2" toward the shell-like ultracompact HII region G5.89-0.39 with the Submillimeter Array. The integrated CH3CN emission reveals dense and hot molecular cocoon in the periphery of the HII region G5.89-0.39, with a CH3CN deficient region roughly centered at G5.89-0.39. By analyzing the CH3CN emission using population diagram analysis, we find, for the first time, a decreasing temperature structure from 150 to 40 K with the projected distance from Feldt's star, which is thought to be responsible for powering the HII region. Our results further indicate that the majority of the heating energy in the observed dense gas is supplied by the Feldt's star. From the derived CH3CN column density profile, we conclude that the dense gas is not uniformly-distributed but centrally-concentrated, with a power-law exponent of 5.5 for r < 8000 AU, and 2.0 for 8000 AU < r < 20000 AU, where r is the distance to Feldt's star. The estimated large power index of 5.5 can be attributed to an enhancement of CH3CN abundance in the close vicinity of Feldt's star.
astro-ph.GA:The Gould Belt Legacy Survey will survey nearby star-forming regions (within 500 pc), using HARP (Heterodyne Array Receiver Programme), SCUBA-2 (Submillimetre Common- User Bolometer Array 2) and POL-2 (Polarimeter 2) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). This paper describes the initial data obtained using HARP to observe 12CO, 13CO and C18O J = 3 - 2 towards two regions in Orion B, NGC 2024 and NGC 2071. We describe the physical characteristics of the two clouds, calculating temperatures and opacities utilizing all three isotopologues. We find good agreement between temperatures calculated from CO and from dust emission in the dense, energetic regions. We determine the mass and energetics of the clouds, and of the high-velocity material seen in 12CO emission, and compare the relative energetics of the high- and low-velocity material in the two clouds. We present a CLUMPFIND analysis of the 13CO condensations. The slope of the condensation mass functions, at the high-mass ends, is similar to the slope of the initial mass function.
astro-ph.GA:Understanding the hydrodynamical processes and conditions at the interface between the Magellanic Stream (MS) and the Galactic halo is critical to understanding the MS and by extension, gaseous tails in other interacting galaxies. These processes operate on relatively small scales and not only help shape this clumpy stream, but also affect the neutral gas dynamics and transfer of mass from the stream to the halo, thus affecting metal enrichment and gas replenishment of the Galaxy. We describe an observational program to place constraints on these processes through high-resolution measurements of HI emission, HI absorption and Halpha emission with unprecedented sensitivity. Methods will include structural analysis, searching for cold gas cores in clumps and analyzing gas kinematics as it transitions to the halo. The latter method includes sophisticated spatial integration techniques to deeply probe the neutral gas, which we apply to a new HI map obtained from the Green Bank Telescope with the highest sensitivity HI observations of the MS to date. We demonstrate that the integration techniques enhance sensitivity even further, thus allowing detection of apparent MS gas components with density approaching that of the Galactic halo.
astro-ph.GA:This article describes the assembly of an optical (RGB) all-sky mosaic image with an image scale of 36 arcsec/pixel, a limiting magnitude of approx. 14 mag and an 18 bit dynamic range. Using a portable low-cost system, 70 fields (each covering 40 deg x 27 deg) were imaged over a time span of 21 months from dark-sky locations in South Africa, Texas and Michigan. The fields were photometrically calibrated against standard catalog stars. Using sky background data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes, gradients resulting from artificial light pollution, airglow and zodiacal light were eliminated, while the large-scale galactic and extragalactic background resulting from unresolved sources was preserved. The 648 Megapixel image is a valuable educational tool, being able to fully utilize the resolution and dynamic range of modern full-dome planetarium projection systems.
astro-ph.GA:(abridged) We develop a model which describes the coevolution of the mass function of dense cores and of the IMF in a protocluster clump. In the model, cores injected in the clump evolve under the effect of gas accretion. Accretion onto the cores follows a time-dependent accretion rate that describes accretion in a turbulent medium. Once the accretion timescales of cores exceed their contraction timescales, they are turned into stars. We include the effect of feedback by the newly formed massive stars through their stellar winds. A fraction of the wind's energy is assumed to counter gravity and disperse the gas from the protocluster and as a consequence, quench further star formation. The latter effect sets the final IMF of the cluster. We apply our model to a clump that is expected to resemble the progenitor clump of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Our model is able to reproduce both the shape and normalization of the ONC's IMF and the mass function of dense cores in Orion. The complex features of the ONC's IMF,i.e., a shallow slope in the mass range ~0.3-2.5 Msol,a steeper slope in the mass range ~2.5-12 Msol, and a nearly flat tail at the high mass end are reproduced. The model predicts a 'rapid' star formation process with an age spread for the stars of 2.3 10^5 yr which is consistent with the fact that 80% of the ONC's stars have ages of <=0.3 Myr. The model predicts a primordial mass segregation with the most massive stars being born in the region between 2-4 times the core radius of the cluster. In parallel, the model also reproduces, simultaneously, the mass function of dense cores in Orion. We study the effects of varying the model parameters on the resulting IMF and show that the IMF of stellar clusters is expected to show significant variations, provided variations in the clumps and cores properties exist.
astro-ph.GA:We study Milky Way kinematics using a sample of 18.8 million main-sequence stars with r<20 and proper-motion measurements derived from SDSS and POSS astrometry, including ~170,000 stars with radial-velocity measurements from the SDSS spectroscopic survey. Distances to stars are determined using a photometric parallax relation, covering a distance range from ~100 pc to 10 kpc over a quarter of the sky at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>20 degrees). We find that in the region defined by 1 kpc <Z< 5 kpc and 3 kpc <R< 13 kpc, the rotational velocity for disk stars smoothly decreases, and all three components of the velocity dispersion increase, with distance from the Galactic plane. In contrast, the velocity ellipsoid for halo stars is aligned with a spherical coordinate system and appears to be spatially invariant within the probed volume. The velocity distribution of nearby ($Z<1$ kpc) K/M stars is complex, and cannot be described by a standard Schwarzschild ellipsoid. For stars in a distance-limited subsample of stars (<100 pc), we detect a multimodal velocity distribution consistent with that seen by HIPPARCOS. This strong non-Gaussianity significantly affects the measurements of the velocity ellipsoid tilt and vertex deviation when using the Schwarzschild approximation. We develop and test a simple descriptive model for the overall kinematic behavior that captures these features over most of the probed volume, and can be used to search for substructure in kinematic and metallicity space. We use this model to predict further improvements in kinematic mapping of the Galaxy expected from Gaia and LSST.
astro-ph.GA:Water is a key species in many astrophysical environments, but it is particularly important in proto-planetary disks. So far,observations of water in these objects have been scarce, but the situation should soon change thanks to the Herschel satellite. We report here a theoretical study of the water line spectrum of a proto-planetary disk surrounding Ae stars. We show that several lines will be observable with the HIFI instrument onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. We predict that some maser lines could also be observable with ground telescopes and we discuss how the predictions depend not only on the adopted physical and chemical model but also on the set of collisional coefficients used and on the H2 ortho to para ratio through its effect on collisional excitation. This makes the water lines observations a powerful, but dangerous -if misused- diagnostic tool.
astro-ph.GA:The carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances and trends in the bulge are discussed in the context of our recent analysis of these elements in an on-going project based on near-IR spectra (Ryde et al. 2009). We obtained these using the CRIRES spectrometer on the VLT. The formation and evolution of the Milky Way bulge can be constrained by studying elemental abundances of bulge stars. Due to the large and variable visual extinction in the line-of-sight towards the bulge, an analysis in the near-IR is preferred.
astro-ph.GA:Using the radiative transfer code Torus, we produce spectral-line cubes of the predicted HI profile from global SPH simulations of spiral galaxies. Torus grids the SPH galaxy using Adaptive Mesh Refinement, then applies a ray-tracing method to infer the HI profile along the line(s) of sight. The gridded galaxy can be observed from any direction, which enables us to model the observed HI profile for galaxies of any orientation. We can also place the observer inside the galaxy, to simulate HI observations taken from the Earth's position in the Milky Way.
astro-ph.GA:We observed two fields near M32 with the ACS/HRC on board the Hubble Space Telescope, located at distances of about 1.8' and 5.4' (hereafter F1 and F2, respectively) from the center of M32. To obtain a very detailed and deep color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and to look for short period variability, we obtained time-series imaging of each field in 32-orbit-long exposures using the F435W (B) and F555W (V) filters, spanning a temporal range of 2 days per filter. We focus on our detection of variability on RR Lyrae variable stars, which represents the only way to obtain information about the presence of a very old population (larger than 10 Gyr) in M32 from optical data. Here we present results obtained from the detection of 31 RR Lyrae in these fields: 17 in F1 and 14 in F2.
astro-ph.GA:We report results concerning the distribution and properties of galactic extinction at high galactic latitudes derived from stellar statistics using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use the classical Wolf diagram method to identify regions with extinction, and derive the extinction and the extinction law of the dust using all five SDSS spectral bands. We estimate the distance to the extinguishing medium using simple assumptions about the stellar populations in the line of sight.   We report the identification of three extinguishing clouds, each a few tens of pc wide, producing 0.2-0.4 mag of g'-band extinction, located 1-2 kpc away or 0.5-1 kpc above the galactic plane. All clouds exhibit grey extinction, i.e., almost wavelength-independent in the limited spectral range of the SDSS. We discuss the implication of this finding on general astrophysical questions.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the correlation between the mass of a central supermassive black hole and the total gravitational mass of the host galaxy (M_tot). The results are based on 43 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey whose black hole masses were estimated through two scaling relations: the relation between black hole mass and Sersic index (M_bh - n) and the relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion (M_bh - sigma). We use the enclosed mass within R_200, the radius within which the density profile of the early type galaxy exceeds the critical density of the Universe by a factor of 200, determined by gravitational lens models fitted to HST imaging data, as a tracer of the total gravitational mass. The best fit correlation, where M_bh is determined from M_bh - sigma relation, is log(M_bh) = (8.18 +/- 0.11) + (1.55 +/- 0.31) (log(M_tot) - 13.0) over 2 orders of magnitude in M_bh. From a variety of tests, we find that we cannot reliably infer a connection between M_bh and M_tot from the M_bh - n relation. The M_bh - M_tot relation provides some of the first, direct observational evidence to test the prediction that supermassive black hole properties are determined by the halo properties of the host galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:We find that the amount and nature of the assumed ionizing background can strongly affect galaxy formation and evolution. Galaxy evolution simulations typically incorporate an ultraviolet background which falls off rapidly above z=3; e.g., that of Haardt & Madau (1996). However, this decline may be too steep to fit the WMAP constraints on electron scattering optical depth or observations of intermediate redshift (z ~ 2-4) Ly-alpha forest transmission. As an alternative, we present simulations of the cosmological formation of individual galaxies with UV backgrounds that decline more slowly at high redshift: both a simple intensity rescaling and the background recently derived by Faucher-Giguere (2009), which softens the spectrum at higher redshifts. We also test an approximation of the X-ray background with a similar z-dependence. We find for the test galaxies that an increase in either the intensity or hardness of ionizing radiation generically pushes star formation towards lower redshifts: although overall star formation in the simulation boxes is reduced by 10-25%, the galaxies show a factor of ~2 increase in the fraction of stars within a 30 kpc radius that are formed after z=1. Other effects include late gas inflows enhanced up to 30 times, stellar half-mass radii decreased by up to 30%, central velocity dispersions increased up to 40%, and a strong reduction in substructure. The magnitude of the effects depends on the environmental/accretion properties of the particular galaxy.
astro-ph.GA:We have observed the rotational ground-state (J = 1-0) transitions of DCO+, HN13C and DNC with the IRAM 30m telescope toward the dark cloud LDN 1512 which has exceptionally narrow lines permitting hyperfine splitting to be resolved in part. The measured splittings of 50-300 kHz are used to derive nuclear quadrupole and spin-rotation parameters for these species. The measurements are supplemented by high-level quantum-chemical calculations using coupled-cluster techniques and large atomic-orbital basis sets.   We find eQq = +151.12 (400) kHz and C_I = -1.12 (43) kHz for DCO+, eQq = 272.5 (51) kHz for HN13C, and eQq(D) = 265.9 (83) kHz and eQq(N) = 288.2 (71) kHz for DNC. The numbers for DNC are consistent with previous laboratory data, while our constants for DCO+ are somewhat smaller than previous results based on astronomical data. For both DCO+ and DNC, our results are more accurate than previous determinations. Our results are in good agreement with the corresponding best theoretical estimates. We also derive updated rotational constants for HN13C: B = 43545.6000 (47) MHz and D = 93.7 (20) kHz.   The hyperfine splittings of the DCO+, DNC and HN13C J = 1-0 lines range over 0.47-1.28 km/s, which is comparable to typical line widths in pre-stellar cores and to systematic gas motions on ~1000 AU scales in protostellar cores. We present tabular information to allow inclusion of the hyperfine splitting in astronomical data interpretation. The large differences in the 14N quadrupole parameters of DNC and HN13C have been traced to differences in the vibrational corrections caused by significant non-rigidity of these molecules, particularly along the bending coordinate.
astro-ph.GA:We have combined 327.5 MHz radio observations and optical spectroscopy to study conditions in the Extended Orion Nebula. We see a steady progression of characteristics with increasing distance from the dominant photoionizing star Theta1OriC. This progression includes a decrease in the F(Halpha)/F(Hbeta) ratio, an increase in the relative strength of scattered stellar continuum, decrease in electron density determined from the [S II] doublet, and increase in the ratio of Emission Measures derived from the Hbeta line and the 327.5 MHz radio continuum. We conclude that beyond about 5' south of Theta1OriC that scattered light from the much brighter central Huygens region of the nebula significantly contaminates local emission. This strengthens earlier arguments that wavelength and model dependent scattering of emission line radiation imposes a fundamental limit on our ability to determine the physical conditions and abundances in this and arguably other similar Galactic Nebulae. The implications for the study of extra-galactic HII regions are even more severe. We confirm the result of an earlier study that at least the eastern boundary of the Extended Orion Nebula is dominated by scattered light from the Huygens region.
astro-ph.GA:The proper motions of OB-associations computed using the old (Hipparcos 1997} and new (van Leeuwen 2007) reductions of the Hipparcos data are in a good agreement with each other. The Galactic rotation curve derived from an analysis of line-of-sight velocities and proper motions of OB-associations is almost flat in the 3-kpc neighborhood of the Sun. The angular rotation velocity at the solar distance is Omega_0=31 +/-1 km s-1 kpc-1. The standard deviation of the velocities of OB-associations from the rotation curve is sigma=7.2 km s-1. The distance scale for OB associations (Blaha & Humphreys 1989) should be shortened by 10-20%. The residual velocities of OB-associations calculated for the new and old reductions differ, on average, by 3.5 km s-1. The mean residual velocities of OB-associations in the stellar-gas complexes depend only slightly on the data reduction employed.
astro-ph.GA:Recently it has been proposed that there are two types of SN Ia progenitors -- short-lived and long-lived. On the basis of this idea, we develope a theory of a unified mechanism for the formation of the bimodal radial distribution of iron and oxygen in the Galactic disc. The underlying cause for the formation of the fine structure of the radial abundance pattern is the influence of spiral arms, specifically, the combined effect of the corotation resonance and turbulent diffusion. From our modelling we conclude that to explain the bimodal radial distributions simultaneously for oxygen and iron and to obtain approximately equal total iron output from different types of supernovae, the mean ejected iron mass per supernova event should be the same as quoted in literature if maximum mass of stars, that eject heavy elements, is $50 M_{\odot}$. For the upper mass limit of $70 M_{\odot}$ the production of iron by a supernova II explosion should be increased by about 1.5 times.
astro-ph.GA:We present submillimetre observations of the J = 3-2 rotational transition of 12CO, 13CO and C18O across over 600 sq arcmin of the Perseus molecular cloud, undertaken with HARP, a new array spectrograph on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The data encompass four regions of the cloud, containing the largest clusters of dust continuum condensations: NGC 1333, IC348, L1448 and L1455. A new procedure to remove striping artefacts from the raw HARP data is introduced. We compare the maps to those of the dust continuum emission mapped with SCUBA (Hatchell et al. 2005) and the positions of starless and protostellar cores (Hatchell et al. 2007a). No straightforward correlation is found between the masses of each region derived from the HARP CO and SCUBA data, underlining the care that must be exercised when comparing masses of the same object derived from different tracers. From the 13CO/C18O line ratio the relative abundance of the two species ([13CO]/[C18O] ~ 7) and their opacities (typically tau is 0.02-0.22 and 0.15-1.52 for the C18O and 13CO gas respectively) are calculated. C18O is optically thin nearly everywhere, increasing in opacity towards star-forming cores but not beyond tau(C18O)~0.9. Assuming the 12CO gas is optically thick we compute its excitation temperature (around 8-30 K), which has little correlation with estimates of the dust temperature.
astro-ph.GA:The Crab Pulsar is a relatively young neutron star. The pulsar is the central star in the Crab Nebula, a remnant of the supernova SN 1054, which was observed on Earth in the year 1054. The Crab Pulsar has been extensively observed in the gamma-ray energy band by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the main instrument onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, during its first months of data taking. The LAT data have been used to reconstruct the fluxes and the energy spectra of the pulsed gamma-ray component and of the gamma-rays from the nebula. The results on the pulsed component are in good agreement with the previous measurement from EGRET, while the results on the nebula are consistent with the observations from Earth based telescopes.
astro-ph.GA:A campaign is described, open to participation by interested AAVSO members, of follow-up observations for newly-discovered Cepheid variables in undersampled and obscured regions of the Galaxy. A primary objective being to use these supergiants to clarify the Galaxy's spiral nature. Preliminary multiband photometric observations are presented for three Cepheids discovered beyond the obscuring dust between the Cygnus & Aquila Rifts (40 \le l \le 50 degrees), a region reputedly tied to a segment of the Sagittarius-Carina arm which appears to cease unexpectedly. The data confirm the existence of exceptional extinction along the line of sight at upwards of A_V~6 magnitudes (d~2 kpc, l~47 degrees), however, the noted paucity of optical spiral tracers in the region does not arise solely from incompleteness owing to extinction. A hybrid spiral map of the Galaxy comprised of classical Cepheids, young open clusters & H II regions, and molecular clouds, presents a consistent picture of the Milky Way and confirms that the three Cepheids do not populate the main portion of the Sagittarius-Carina arm, which does not emanate locally from this region. The Sagitarrius-Carina arm, along with other distinct spiral features, are found to deviate from the canonical logarithmic spiral pattern. Revised parameters are also issued for the Cepheid BY Cas, and it is identified on the spiral map as lying mainly in the foreground to young associations in Cassiopeia. A Fourier analysis of BY Cas' light-curve implies overtone pulsation, and the Cepheid is probably unassociated with the open cluster NGC 663 since the distances, ages, and radial velocities do not match.
astro-ph.GA:Irregular galaxies are usually smaller and less massive than their spiral, S0, and elliptical counterparts. Radio observations indicate that a magnetic field is present in irregular galaxies whose value is similar to that in spiral galaxies. However, the conditions in the interstellar medium of an irregular galaxy are unfavorable for amplification of the magnetic field because of the slow rotation and low shearing rate. We investigate the cosmic-ray driven dynamo in the interstellar medium of an irregular galaxy. We study its efficiency under the conditions of slow rotation and weak shear. The star formation is also taken into account in our model and is parametrized by the frequency of explosions and modulations of activity. The numerical model includes a magnetohydrodynamical dynamo driven by cosmic rays that is injected into the interstellar medium by randomly exploding supernovae. In the model, we also include essential elements such as vertical gravity of the disk, differential rotation approximated by the shearing box, and resistivity leading to magnetic reconnection. We find that even slow galactic rotation with a low shearing rate amplifies the magnetic field, and that rapid rotation with a low value of the shear enhances the efficiency of the dynamo. Our simulations have shown that a high amount of magnetic energy leaves the simulation box becoming an efficient source of intergalactic magnetic fields.
astro-ph.GA:MASSCLEAN is a new, sophisticated and robust stellar cluster image and photometry simulation package. This package is able to create color-magnitude diagrams and standard FITS images in any of the traditional optical and near-infrared bands based on cluster characteristics input by the user, including but not limited to distance, age, mass, radius and extinction. At the limit of very distant, unresolved clusters, we have checked the integrated colors created in MASSCLEAN against those from other simple stellar population (SSP) models with consistent results. Because the algorithm populates the cluster with a discrete number of tenable stars, it can be used as part of a Monte Carlo Method to derive the probabilistic range of characteristics (integrated colors, for example) consistent with a given cluster mass and age. We present the first ever mass dependent integrated colors as a function of age, derived from over 100,000 Monte Carlo runs, which can be used to improve the current age determination methods for stellar clusters.
astro-ph.GA:Recent 1.2-mm continuum observations have shown the giant HII region NGC3576 to be embedded in the centre of an extended filamentary dust-cloud. The bulk of the filament away from the HII region contains a number of clumps seen only at (sub-)millimetre wavelengths and which may host massive protostellar objects at a very early stage of evolution. We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to image the cloud for the NH3(1,1), (2,2) and (4,4) transitions, 22 GHz water masers, and 23 GHz continuum emission. We also utilised the 22-m Mopra antenna to map the region for the molecular lines 13CO (1-0), C18O (1-0), HCO+ (1-0), H13CO+ (1-0), CS (1-0) and N2H+ (1-0).The HII region is observed to be expanding into the molecular cloud, sweeping up a clumpy shell of gas, while the central star cluster is dispersing the molecular gas to the east. Temperatures are highest adjacent to the central HII region, indicating that the embedded cluster of young stars there is heating the gas. Six new water masers were detected in the arms of the filament, all associated with NH3 emission peaks, confirming that star-formation has begun within these cores. Core masses range from 5 to 516 solar masses and most appear to be gravitationally bound. Complementary results by Andr\'e et al. (2008) imply that seven cores will go on to form massive stars between 15 and 50 solar masses. The large scale velocity structure of the filament is smooth, but at least one clump shows the signature of inward gas motions via asymmetries in the NH3 (1,1) line profiles. The same clump exhibits an enhanced abundance of N2H+, which coupled with an absence of CO indicates depletion onto the dust grain surface. The HII region at the heart of NGC3576 is potentially triggering the formation of massive stars in the bulk of the associated cloud.
astro-ph.GA:Over the last decades, numerous wide (>1000 AU) binaries have been discovered in the Galactic field and halo. The origin of these wide binaries cannot be explained by star formation or by dynamical interactions in the Galactic field. We explain their existence by wide binary formation during the dissolution phase of young star clusters. In this scenario, two single stars that leave the dissolving cluster at the same time, in the same direction, and with similar velocities, form a new, very wide binary. Using N-body simulations we study how frequently this occurs, and how the orbital parameters of such binaries depend on the properties of the cluster from which they originate. The resulting wide binary fraction for individual star clusters is 1-30%, depending on the initial conditions. As most stars form as part of a binary or multiple system, we predict that a large fraction of these wide binaries are in fact wide triple and quadruple systems.
astro-ph.GA:We study two dimensional turbulent magnetic reconnection in a compressible fluid in the gas pressure dominated limit. We use open boundary conditions and start from a Harris current sheet configuration with a uniform total pressure. A small perturbation to the vector potential initiates laminar reconnection at the Sweet-Parker rate, which is allowed to evolve for several dynamical times. Subsequently sub-Alfvenic turbulence is produced through random forcing at small wave numbers. The magnetic field topology near the current sheet is strongly affected by the turbulence. However, we find that the resulting reconnection speed depends on the resistivity. In contrast to previous results in three dimensions, we find no evidence for fast reconnection. The reconnection speed exhibits large variations but the time averages increase smoothly with the strength of the turbulence.
astro-ph.GA:We present infrared imaging from IRIS2 on the Anglo-Australian Telescope that shows the barred spiral galaxy IC 4933 has not just an inner ring encircling the bar, but also a star-forming nuclear ring 1.5 kpc in diameter. Imaging in the u' band with GMOS on Gemini South confirms that this ring is not purely an artifact due to dust. Optical and near-infrared colours alone however cannot break the degeneracy between age, extinction, and burst duration that would allow the star formation history of the ring to be unraveled. Integral field spectroscopy with the GNIRS spectrograph on Gemini South shows the equivalent width of the Pa-beta line to peak in the north and south quadrants of the ring, indicative of a bipolar azimuthal age gradient around the ring. The youngest star-forming regions do not appear to correspond to where we expect to find the contact points between the offset dust lanes and the nuclear ring unless the nuclear ring is oval in shape, causing the contact points to lead the bar by more than 90 degrees.
astro-ph.GA:We report on deep imaging of a remote M31 globular cluster, MGC1, obtained with Gemini/GMOS. Our colour-magnitude diagram for this object extends ~5 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch and exhibits features consistent with an ancient metal-poor stellar population, including a long, well-populated horizontal branch. The red giant branch locus suggests MGC1 has a metal abundance [M/H] ~ -2.3. We measure the distance to MGC1 and find that it lies ~160 kpc in front of M31 with a distance modulus of 23.95 +/- 0.06. Combined with its large projected separation of 117 kpc from M31 this implies a deprojected radius of Rgc = 200 +/- 20 kpc, rendering it the most isolated known globular cluster in the Local Group by some considerable margin. We construct a radial brightness profile for MGC1 and show that it is both centrally compact and rather luminous, with Mv = -9.2. Remarkably, the cluster profile shows no evidence for a tidal limit and we are able to trace it to a radius of at least 450 pc, and possibly as far as ~900 pc. The profile exhibits a power-law fall-off with exponent -2.5, breaking to -3.5 in its outermost parts. This core-halo structure is broadly consistent with expectations derived from numerical models, and suggests that MGC1 has spent many gigayears in isolation.
astro-ph.GA:A sample of RR Lyrae (RRL) variables from the Southern Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Object survey in regions overlapping the expected position of debris from the interaction of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy with the Milky Way (RA ~ 20 and 21.5 h; distance 16-21 kpc) has been followed up spectroscopically and photometrically. The 21 photometrically confirmed type ab RRLs have mean [Fe/H] = -1.79 +/- 0.08, consistent with the abundances found for RRLs in a different portion of the Sgr tidal debris stream. The distribution of velocities in the Galactic standard of rest frame (V_GSR) of the 26 RRLs in the region is not consistent with a smooth halo population. Upon comparison with the Sgr disruption models of Law et al (2005), a prominent group of five stars having highly negative radial velocities (V_GSR ~ -175 kms-1) is consistent with predictions for old trailing debris when the Galactic halo is modeled as oblate. The observations also require that the recent trailing debris stream has a broader spread perpendicular to the Sgr plane than predicted by the models. We have also investigated the possible association of the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS) with Sgr debris by comparing radial velocities for RRLs in the region with the same models, finding similarities in the velocity-position trends. As suggested by our earlier work, the stars in the VSS region with large negative V_GSR values are likely to be old leading Sgr debris, but we find that while old trailing Sgr debris may well make a contribution at positive V_GSR values, it is unlikely to fully account for the VSS feature. Overall we find that further modeling is needed, as trailing arm data generally favors oblate models while leading arm data favors prolate models, with no single potential fitting all the observed data.
astro-ph.GA:We test the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory with the velocity-dispersion profiles of Galactic globular clusters populating the outermost region of the Milky Way halo, where the Galactic acceleration is lower than the characteristic MOND acceleration a_0. For this purpose, we constructed self-consistent, spherical models of stellar systems in MOND, which are the analogues of the Newtonian King models. The models are spatially limited, reproduce well the surface-brightness profiles of globular clusters, and have velocity-dispersion profiles that differ remarkably in shape from the corresponding Newtonian models. We present dynamical models of six globular clusters, which can be used to efficiently test MOND with the available observing facilities. A comparison with recent spectroscopic data obtained for NGC2419 suggests that the kinematics of this cluster might be hard to explain in MOND.
astro-ph.GA:Context: The Red MSX Source (RMS) survey has identified a large sample of candidate massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and ultra compact (UC) HII regions from a sample of ~2000 MSX and 2MASS colour selected sources. Aims: To search for H2O masers towards a large sample of young high mass stars and to investigate the statistical correlation of H2O masers with the earliest stages of massive star formation. Methods: We have used the Mopra Radio telescope to make position-switched observations towards ~500 UCHII regions and MYSOs candidates identified from the RMS survey and located between 190\degr < l < 30\degr. These observations have a 4$\sigma$ sensitivity of ~1 Jy and a velocity resolution of ~0.4 km/s.} Results: We have detected 163 H2O masers, approximately 75% of which were previously unknown. Comparing the maser velocities with the velocities of the RMS sources, determined from 13CO observations, we have identified 135 RMS-H2O maser associations, which corresponds to a detection rate of ~27%. Taking into account the differences in sensitivity and source selection we find our detection rate is in general agreement with previously reported surveys. Conclusions: We find similar detection rates for UCHII regions and MYSOs candidates, suggesting that the conditions needed for maser activity are equally likely in these two stages of the star formation process. Looking at the detection rate as a function of distance from the Galactic centre we find it significantly enhanced within the solar circle, peaking at ~37% between 6-7 kpc, which is consistent with previous surveys of UC HII regions, possibly indicating the presence of a high proportion of more luminous YSOs and HII regions.
astro-ph.GA:Using imaging that shows four magnitudes of main sequence stars, we have discovered that the Galactic globular cluster NGC 1851 is surrounded by a halo that is visible from the tidal radius of 700 arcsec (41 pc) to more than 4500 arcsec (>250 pc). This halo is symmetric and falls in density as a power law of $r^{-1.24}$. It contains approximately 0.1% of the dynamical mass of NGC 1851. There is no evidence for tidal tails. Current models of globular cluster evolution do not explain this feature, although simulations of tidal influences on dwarf spheroidal galaxies qualitatively mimic these results. Given the state of published models it is not possible to decide between creation of this halo from isolated cluster evaporation, or from tidal or disk shocking, or from destruction of a dwarf galaxy in which this object may have once been embedded.
astro-ph.GA:We present images of the planetary nebulae (PNe) NGC 7354 and NGC 3242 in four mid-infrared (MIR) photometric bands centred at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 microns; the results of observations undertaken using the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). The resulting images show the presence of a halo and rings in NGC 3242, as previously observed through narrow band imaging at visual wavelengths, as well as evidence for a comparable halo and ring system in NGC 7354. This is the first time that a halo and rings have been observed in the latter source.   We have analysed the formation of halos as a result of radiatively accelerated mass loss in the AGB progenitors. Although the models assume that dust formation occurs in C-rich environments, we note that qualitatively similar results would be expected for O-rich progenitors as well. The model fall-offs in halo density are found to result in gradients in halo surface brightness which are similar to those observed in the visible and MIR.
astro-ph.GA:The motion of planetary nebulae (PNe) through the interstellar medium (ISM) is thought to lead to a variety of observational consequences, including the formation of bright rims; deformation and fragmentation of the shells; and a shift of the central stars away from the geometric centres of the envelopes. These and other characteristics have been noted through imaging in the visual wavelength regime. We report further observations of such shells taken in the mid-infrared (MIR), acquired through programs of IRAC imaging undertaken using the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST).   NGC 2440 and NGC 6629 are shown to possess likely interacting halos, together with ram-pressure stripped material to one side of their shells. Similarly, the outer halos of NGC 3242 and NGC 6772 appear to have been fragmented through Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, leading to a possible flow of ISM material towards the inner portions of their envelopes. If this interpretation is correct, then it would suggest that NGC 3242 is moving towards the NE; a suggestion which is also supported through the presence of a 60 microns tail extending in the opposite direction, and curved bands of H-alpha emission in the direction of motion - components which may arise through RT instabilities in the magnetized ISM.
astro-ph.GA:Recent models of molecular cloud formation and evolution suggest that such clouds are dynamic and generally exhibit gravitational collapse. We present a simple analytic model of global collapse onto a filament and compare this with our numerical simulations of the flow-driven formation of an isolated molecular cloud to illustrate the supersonic motions and infall ram pressures expected in models of gravity-driven cloud evolution. We apply our results to observations of the Pipe Nebula, an especially suitable object for our purposes as its low star formation activity implies insignifcant perturbations from stellar feedback. We show that our collapsing cloud model can explain the magnitude of the velocity dispersions seen in the $^{13}$CO filamentary structure by Onishi et al. and the ram pressures required by Lada et al. to confine the lower-mass cores in the Pipe nebula. We further conjecture that higher-resolution simulations will show small velocity dispersions in the densest core gas, as observed, but which are infall motions and not supporting turbulence. Our results point out the inevitability of ram pressures as boundary conditions for molecular cloud filaments, and the possibility that especially lower-mass cores still can be accreting mass at significant rates, as suggested by observations.
astro-ph.GA:We present evidence for interaction between the supernova remnant (SNR) G357.7+0.3 and nearby molecular clouds, leading to the formation of wind-swept structures and bright emission rims. These features are not observed at visual wavelengths, but are clearly visible in mid-infrared (MIR) mapping undertaken using the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Analysis of one of these clouds, the bright cometary structure G357.46+0.60, suggests that it contains strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features in the 5.8 and 8.0 microns photometric bands, and that these are highly variable over relatively small spatial scales. This source also appears to contain a YSO within the bright rim structure, with a steeply rising spectrum between 1.25 and 24 microns.   Finally, it is noted that a further, conical emission region appears to be associated with the Mira V1139 Sco, and it is suggested that this may represent the case of a Mira outflow interacting with a SNR.
astro-ph.GA:We present mid-infrared (MIR) photometry for 367 Galactic disk, bulge and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) planetary nebulae, determined using GLIMPSE II and SAGE data acquired using the Spitzer Space Telescope. This has permitted us to make a comparison between the luminosity functions of bulge and LMC planetary nebulae, and between the MIR colours of all three categories of source. It is determined that whilst the 3.6 microns luminosity function of the LMC and bulge sources are likely to be closely similar, the [3.6]-[5.8] and [5.8]-[8-0] indices of LMC nebulae are different from those of their disk and bulge counterparts. This may arise because of enhanced 6.2 microns PAH emission within the LMC sources, and/or as a result of differences between the spectra of LMC PNe and those of their Galactic counterparts. We also determine that the more evolved disk sources listed in the MASH catalogues of Parker et al. and Miszalski et al. (2008) have similar colours to those of the less evolved (and higher surface brightness) sources in the catalogue of Acker et al. (1992); a result which appears at variance with previous studies of these sources.
astro-ph.GA:Fukui et al. (2006) discovered two molecular loops in the Galactic center and argued that the foot points of the molecular loops, two bright spots at both loops ends, represent the gas accumulated by the falling motion along the loops, subsequent to magnetic flotation by the Parker instability. We have carried out sensitive CO observations of the foot points toward l=356 deg at a few pc resolution in the six rotational transitions of CO; 12CO(J=1-0, 3-2, 4-3, 7-6), 13CO(J=1-0) and C18O(J=1-0). The high resolution image of 12CO (J=3-2) has revealed the detailed distribution of the high excitation gas including U shapes, the outer boundary of which shows sharp intensity jumps accompanying strong velocity gradients. An analysis of the multi-J CO transitions shows that the temperature is in a range from 30-100 K and density is around 10^3-10^4 cm^-3, confirming that the foot points have high temperature and density although there is no prominent radiative heating source such as high mass stars in or around the loops. We argue that the high temperature is likely due to the shock heating under C-shock condition caused by the magnetic flotation. We made a comparison of the gas distribution with theoretical numerical simulations and note that the U shape is consistent with numerical simulations. We also find that the region of highest temperature of ~100 K or higher inside the U shape corresponds to the spur having an upward flow, additionally heated up either by magnetic reconnection or bouncing in the interaction with the narrow neck at the bottom of the U shape. We note these new findings further reinforce the magnetic floatation interpretation.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the problem of probing the local spatial structure of the magnetic field of the interstellar medium using multi-frequency polarized maps of the synchrotron emission at radio wavelengths. We focus in this paper on the three-dimensional reconstruction of the largest scales of the magnetic field, relying on the internal depolarization (due to differential Faraday rotation) of the emitting medium as a function of electromagnetic frequency. We argue that multi-band spectroscopy in the radio wavelengths, developed in the context of high-redshift extragalactic HI lines, can be a very useful probe of the 3D magnetic field structure of our Galaxy when combined with a Maximum A Posteriori reconstruction technique. When starting from a fair approximation of the magnetic field, we are able to recover the true one by using a linearized version of the corresponding inverse problem. The spectral analysis of this problem allows us to specify the best sampling strategy in electromagnetic frequency and predicts a spatially anisotropic distribution of posterior errors. The reconstruction method is illustrated for reference fields extracted from realistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations.
astro-ph.GA:Aims. The detailed analysis of all data taken by the XMM-Newton satellite of UGC11763 to characterize the different components that are emitting and absorbing radiation in the vicinity of the active nucleus.   Methods. The continuum emission was studied through the EPIC spectra taking profit of the spectral range of these cameras. The high resolution RGS spectra were analyzed in order to characterize the absorbing features and the emission line features that arise in the spectra of this source.   Results. A power law with a photon index \Gamma = 1.72^{+0.03}_{-0.01} accounts for the continuum emission of this source in the hard X-rays from 10 down to 1 keV. At lower energies, a black body model with kT= 0.100\pm 0.003 keV provides a good description of the observed soft excess. The absorption signatures in the spectra of UGC11763 are consistent with the presence of a two phase ionized material (log U=1.65^{+0.07}_{-0.08}; 2.6\pm 0.1 and log N_{H} = 21.2\pm 0.2; 21.51\pm 0.01 cm^{-2}, respectively) in the line of sight. The physical conditions found are consistent with the two phases being in pressure equilibrium. The low ionization component is more ionized than typically found for warm absorbers in other Seyfert 1 galaxies. There are also signatures of some emission lines: Ovii He$\alpha$(r), Ovii He$\alpha$(f), a blend of the Neix He$\alpha$ triplet and Fexviii at \lambda 17.5 \AA.
astro-ph.GA:The timescale for star formation, a measure of how quickly neutral gas is being converted to stars, is considerably longer than typical dynamical timescales associated with a galactic disk. For purposes of modeling galaxy evolution, however, it would be extremely attractive if the star formation timescale were proportional to an easily derived dynamical timescale. We compare estimates of the star formation timescale within nearby galaxies, based on the work of Leroy et al. (2008) and existing BIMA SONG CO data, with three simple forms of the dynamical time: the orbital time, the free-fall time at the midplane density, and the disk Jeans time (the growth time for gravitational instabilities in a disk). When taking into account the gravity of the stellar disk in an approximate way, all three timescales show correlations with the star formation timescale, though none of the correlations can be accurately described as linear. Systematic errors in estimating appropriate gas masses and the stellar velocity dispersion may obscure an underlying correlation, but we focus instead on a model where the timescale for H_2 formation from HI is decoupled from the timescale for star formation from H_2. The Jeans time correlates well with the first of these timescales, but the relationship is still non-linear, and requires a characteristic GMC lifetime that increases toward galaxy centers.
astro-ph.GA:We have carried out high-angular resolution (1.4") observations in the continuum at 3.1mm and in the N2H+ 1-0, CH3CN 5_k-4_k and 13CS 2-1 lines using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) towards the intermediate mass (IM) protostar IRAS21391+5802 (IC1396N). In addition, we have merged the PdBI images with previous BIMA (continuum data at 1.2mm and 3.1mm) and single-dish (N2H+ 1-0) data to have a comprehensive description of the region. The combination of our data with BIMA and 30m data show that the bipolar outflow associated has completely eroded the initial molecular globule. The 1.2mm and 3.1mm continuum emissions are extended along the outflow axis tracing the warm walls of the biconical cavity. Most of the molecular gas, however, is located in an elongated feature in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. A strong chemical differentiation is detected across the molecular toroid, with the N2H+ 1-0 emission absent in the inner region.This chemical differentiation can be understood in terms of the different gas kinetic temperature. The [CH3CN]/[N2H+] ratio increases by 5 orders of magnitude with gas temperature, for temperatures between 20K and 100K. The CH3CN abundance towards IRAM 2A, the most massive protostellar core, is similar to that found in hot corinos and lower than that expected towards IM and high mass hot cores. This could indicate that IRAM 2A is a low mass or at most Herbig Ae star (IRAM 2A) instead of the precursor of a massive Be star. Alternatively, the low CH3CN abundance could also be the consequence of IRAM 2A being a Class 0/I transition object which has already formed a small photodissociation region (PDR).
astro-ph.GA:We systematically investigate the error sources for high-precision astrometry from adaptive optics based near-infrared imaging data. We focus on the application in the crowded stellar field in the Galactic Center. We show that at the level of <=100 micro-arcseconds a number of effects are limiting the accuracy. Most important are the imperfectly subtracted seeing halos of neighboring stars, residual image distortions and unrecognized confusion of the target source with fainter sources in the background. Further contributors to the error budget are the uncertainty in estimating the point spread function, the signal-to-noise ratio induced statistical uncertainty, coordinate transformation errors, the chromaticity of refraction in Earth's atmosphere, the post adaptive optics differential tilt jitter and anisoplanatism. For stars as bright as mK=14, residual image distortions limit the astrometry, for fainter stars the limitation is set by the seeing halos of the surrounding stars. In order to improve the astrometry substantially at the current generation of telescopes, an adaptive optics system with high performance and weak seeing halos over a relatively small field (r<=3") is suited best. Furthermore, techniques to estimate or reconstruct the seeing halo could be promising.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the young (proto)stellar population in NGC 2023 and the L 1630 molecular cloud bordering the HII region IC 434, using Spitzer IRAC and MIPS archive data, JCMT SCUBA imaging and spectroscopy as well as targeted BIMA observations of one of the Class 0 protostars, NGC 2023 MM1. We have performed photometry of all IRAC and MIPS images, and used color-color diagrams to identify and classify all young stars seen within a 22'x26' field along the boundary between IC 434 and L 1630. For some stars, which have sufficient optical, IR, and/or sub-millimeter data we have also used the online SED fitting tool for a large 2D archive of axisymmetric radiative transfer models to perform more detailed modeling of the observed SEDs. We identify 5 sub-millimeter cores in our 850 and 450 micron SCUBA images, two of which have embedded class 0 or I protostars. Observations with BIMA are used to refine the position and characteristics of the Class 0 source NGC 2023 MM 1. These observations show that it is embedded in a very cold cloud core, which is strongly enhanced in NH2D. We find that HD 37903 is the most massive member of a cluster with 20 -- 30 PMS stars. We also find smaller groups of PMS stars formed from the Horsehead nebula and another elephant trunk structure to the north of the Horsehead. We refine the spectral classification of HD 37903 to B2 Ve. Our study shows that the expansion of the IC 434 HII region has triggered star formation in some of the dense elephant trunk structures and compressed gas inside the L 1630 molecular cloud. This pre-shock region is seen as a sub-millimeter ridge in which stars have already formed. The cluster associated with NGC 2023 is very young, and has a large fraction of Class I sources.
astro-ph.GA:A pulsar beam passing close to a black hole can provide a probe of very strong gravitational fields even if the pulsar itself is not in a strong field region. In the case that the spin of the hole can be ignored, we have previously shown that all strong field effects on the beam can be understood in terms of two "universal" functions, $F(\phi_{\rm in})$ and $T(\phi_{\rm in})$ of the angle of beam emission $\phi_{\rm in}$; these functions are universal in that they depend only on a single parameter, the pulsar/black hole distance from which the beam is emitted. Here we apply this formalism to general pulsar-hole-observer geometries, with arbitrary alignment of the pulsar spin axis and arbitrary pulsar beam direction and angular width. We show that the analysis of the observational problem has two distinct elements: (i) the computation of the location and trajectory of an observer-dependent "keyhole" direction of emission in which a signal can be received by the observer; (ii) the determination of an annulus that represents the set of directions containing beam energy. Examples of each are given along with an example of a specific observational scenario.
astro-ph.GA:Recent studies of the circumgalactic gaseous environment of the Milky Way have concentrated on the distribution, chemical composition, and physical properties of the most massive neutral gas clouds and the highly-ionized halo absorbers. Relatively little effort has been put so far in exploring the circumgalactic neutral and weakly ionized metal absorbers at low HI column densities.   With our work we systematically study the distribution and physical properties of neutral and ionised low-column density gas in the halo of the Milky Way. We combine CaII and NaI absorption line measurements with HI 21-cm emission line data. For some of the sight lines high-resolution radio synthesis observations were performed allowing us to study small-scale structures that cannot be resolved with single dish telescopes.   In total 177 lines of sight were observed, providing a large absorption-selected data sample for the analysis of IVC and HVC gas in the circumgalactic environment of the Milky Way. The study allows us to compare the observed absorption column density distribution (CDD) of gas in the Milky Way halo with the overall CDD of intervening absorbers towards quasars. The sensitive absorption line analysis enables us to identify the neutral and ionised gaseous structures at low column densities and small angular extent that possibly remain unseen in large 21-cm all-sky surveys. If this gas cover a significant portion of the sky, it possibly has a large influence on the evolution of the Milky Way.
astro-ph.GA:We reduced the observational logarithmic space densities in the vertical direction up to 8 kpc from the galactic plane, for stars with absolute magnitudes (5,6], (6,7] and [5,10] in the fields $#$0952+5245 and SA114, to a single exponential density law. One of three parameters in the quadratic expression of the density law corresponds to the local space density for stars with absolute magnitudes in question. There is no need of any definition for scaleheights or population types. We confirm with the arguments of non-discrete thin and thick discs for our Galaxy and propose a single structure up to several kiloparsecs from the galactic plane. The logarithmic space densities evaluated by this law for the ELAIS field fit to the observational ones. Whereas, there are considerable offsets for the logarithmic space densities produced by two sets of classical galactic model parameters from the observational ones, for the same field.
astro-ph.GA:We present a catalog of 8358 sources extracted from images produced by the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). The BGPS is a survey of the millimeter dust continuum emission from the northern Galactic plane. The catalog sources are extracted using a custom algorithm, Bolocat, which was designed specifically to identify and characterize objects in the large-area maps generated from the Bolocam instrument. The catalog products are designed to facilitate follow-up observations of these relatively unstudied objects. The catalog is 98% complete from 0.4 Jy to 60 Jy over all object sizes for which the survey is sensitive (<3.5'). We find that the sources extracted can best be described as molecular clumps -- large dense regions in molecular clouds linked to cluster formation. We find the flux density distribution of sources follows a power law with dN/dS ~S^(-2.4 +/- 0.1) and that the mean Galactic latitude for sources is significantly below the midplane: <b>=(-0.095 +/- 0.001) deg.
astro-ph.GA:Using CARMA, we imaged the 87 GHz SiO v=0 J=2-1 line toward Orion-KL with 0.45 arcsec angular resolution. The maps indicate that radio source I drives a bipolar outflow into the surrounding molecular cloud along a NE--SW axis, in agreement with the model of Greenhill et al. (2004). The extended high velocity outflow from Orion-KL appears to be a continuation of this compact outflow. High velocity gas extends farthest along a NW--SE axis, suggesting that the outflow direction changes on time scales of a few hundred years.
astro-ph.GA:Optical CCD imaging with H$\alpha$ and [SII] filters and spectroscopic observations of the galactic supernova remnant G85.9-0.6 have been performed for the first time. The CCD image data are taken with the 1.5m Russian-Turkish Telescope (RTT150) at TUBITAK National Observatory (TUG) and spectral data are taken with the Bok 2.3 m telescope on Kitt Peak, AZ.   The images are taken with narrow-band interference filters H$\alpha$, [SII] and their continuum. [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio image is performed. The ratio obtained from [SII]/H$\alpha$ is found to be $\sim$0.42, indicating that the remnant interacts with HII regions. G85.9-0.6 shows diffuse-shell morphology. [SII]$\lambda\lambda 6716/6731$ average flux ratio is calculated from the spectra, and the electron density $N_{e}$ is obtained to be 395 $cm^{-3}$. From [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio, shock velocity has been estimated, pre-shock density of $n_{c}=14$ $cm^{-3}$, explosion energy of $E=9.2\times10^{50}$ ergs, interstellar extinction of $E(B-V)=0.28$, and neutral hydrogen column density of $N(HI)=1.53\times10^{21}$ $cm^{-2}$ are reported.
astro-ph.GA:Using N-body simulations of shell galaxies created in nearly radial minor mergers, we investigate the error of collision dating, resulting from the neglect of dynamical friction and of gradual disruption of the cannibalized dwarf.
astro-ph.GA:The structure and kinematics of the recognized stellar components of the Milky Way are explored, based on well-determined atmospheric parameters and kinematic quantities for 32360 calibration stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and its first extension, (SDSS-II), which included the sub-survey SEGUE: Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration. Full space motions for a sub-sample of 16920 stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpc of the Sun, are used to derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- and outer-halo components of the Galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-disk and proposed metal-weak thick-disk populations. We first examine the question of whether the data require the presence of at least a two-component halo in order to account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the local volume, and whether more than two components are needed. We also address the question of whether the proposed metal-weak thick disk is kinematically and chemically distinct from the canonical thick disk. In addition, we consider the fractions of each component required to understand the nature of the observed kinematic behavior of the stellar populations of the Galaxy as a function of distance from the plane. Scale lengths and scale heights for the thick-disk and metal-weak thick-disk components are determined. Spatial density profiles for the inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a Jeans Theorem analysis. The full set of calibration stars (including those outside the local volume) is used to test for the expected changes in the observed stellar metallicity distribution function with distance above the Galactic plane in-situ, due to the changing contributions from the underlying stellar populations.

astro-ph.GA:We use deep HST/ACS F555W and F814W photometry of resolved stars in the M81 Group dwarf irregular galaxy Ho II to study the hypothesis that the holes identified in the neutral ISM (HI) are created by stellar feedback. From the deep photometry, we construct color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and measure the star formation histories (SFHs) for stars contained in HI holes from two independent holes catalogs, as well as select control fields, i.e., similar sized regions that span a range of HI column densities. Converting the recent SFHs into stellar feedback energies, we find that enough energy has been generated to have created all holes. However, the required energy is not always produced over a time scale that is less than the estimated kinematic age of the hole. The combination of the CMDs, recent SFHs, and locations of young stars shows that the stellar populations inside HI holes are not coherent, single-aged, stellar clusters, as previously suggested, but rather multi-age populations distributed across each hole. From a comparison of the modeled and observed integrated magnitudes, and the locations and energetics of stars inside of HI holes, we propose a potential new model: a viable mechanism for creating the observed HI holes in Ho II is stellar feedback from multiple generations of SF spread out over tens or hundreds of Myr, and thus, the concept of an age for an HI hole is intrinsically ambiguous. We further find that \halpha and 24 micron emission, tracers of the most recent star formation, do not correlate well with the positions of the HI holes. However, UV emission, which traces star formation over roughly the last 100 Myr, shows a much better correlation with the locations of the HI holes.
astro-ph.GA:We present a sample of 75 extinction curves derived from FUSE far-ultraviolet spectra supplemented by existing IUE spectra. The extinction curves were created using the standard pair method based on a new set of dereddened FUSE+IUE comparison stars. Molecular hydrogen absorption features were removed using individualized H_2 models for each sightline. The general shape of the FUSE extinction (8.4 micron^-1 < lambda^-1 < 11 micron^-1) was found to be broadly consistent with extrapolations from the IUE extinction (3.3 micron-1 < lambda^-1 < 8.6 micron^-1) curve. Significant differences were seen in the strength of the far-UV rise and the width of the 2175 A bump. All the FUSE+IUE extinction curves had positive far-UV slopes giving no indication that the far-UV rise was turning over at the shortest wavelengths. The dependence of A(lambda)/A(V) versus R(V)^-1 in the far-UV using the sightlines in our sample was found to be stronger than tentatively indicated by previous work. We present an updated R(V) dependent relationship for the full UV wavelength range (3.3 micron^-1 <= lambda^-1 <= 11 micron^-1). Finally, we searched for discrete absorption features in the far-ultraviolet. We found a 3 sigma upper limit of ~0.12 A(V) on features with a resolution of 250 (~4 A width) and 3 sigma upper limits of ~0.15 A(V) for lambda^-1 < 9.6 micron^-1 and ~0.68 A(V) for lambda^-1 > 9.6 micron^-1 on features with a resolution of 10^4 (~0.1 A width).
astro-ph.GA:We present a coherent stellar and nebular model reproducing the observations of the Planetary Nebula IC418. We want to test whether a stellar model obtained by fitting the stellar observations is able to satisfactory ionize the nebula and reproduce the nebular observations, which is by no mean evident. This allows us to determine all the physical parameters of both the star and the nebula, including the abundances and the distance. We used all the observational material available (FUSE, IUE, STIS and optical spectra) to constrain the stellar atmosphere model performed using the CMFGEN code. The photoionization model is done with Cloudy_3D, and is based on CTIO, Lick, SPM, IUE and ISO spectra as well as HST images. More than 140 nebular emission lines are compared to the observed intensities. We reproduce all the observations for the star and the nebula. The 3D morphology of the gas distribution is determined. The effective temperature of the star is 36.7kK. Its luminosity is 7700 solar luminosity. We describe an original method to determine the distance of the nebula using evolutionary tracks. No clumping factor is need to reproduce the age-luminosity relation. The distance of 1.25 kpc is found in very good agreement with recent determination using parallax method. The chemical composition of both the star and the nebula are determined. Both are Carbon-rich. The nebula presents evidence of depletion of elements Mg, Si, S, Cl (0.5 dex lower than solar) and Fe (2.9 dex lower than solar). This is the first self-consistent stellar and nebular model for a Planetary Nebula that reproduces all the available observations ranging from IR to UV, showing that the combined approach for the modeling process leads to more restrictive constraints and, in principle, more trustworthy results.
astro-ph.GA:In the context of star and planet formation, understanding the formation of disks is of fundamental importance. Previous studies found that the magnetic field has a very strong impact on the collapse of a prestellar cloud, particularly in possibly suppressing the formation of a disk even for relatively modest values of the magnetic intensity. Since observations infer that cores have a substantial level of magnetization, this raises the question of how disks form. However, most studies have been restricted to the case in which the initial angle, $\alpha$, between the magnetic field and the rotation axis equals 0$^\circ$. We explore and analyse the influence of non aligned configurations on disk formation. We perform 3D ideal MHD, AMR numerical simulations for various values of $\mu$, the ratio of the mass-to-flux to the critical mass-to-flux, and various values of $\alpha$. We find that disks form more easily as $\alpha$ increases from 0 to 90$^\circ$. We propose that as the magnetized pseudo-disks become thicker with increasing $\alpha$, the magnetic braking efficiency is lowered. We also find that even small values of $\alpha$ ($\simeq$ 10-20$^\circ$) show significant differences with the alligned case. Within the framework of ideal MHD and for our choice of initial conditions, centrifugally supported disks cannot form for values of $\mu$ smaller than $\simeq$3, if the magnetic field and the rotation axis are perpendicular, and smaller than about $\simeq$5-10 when they are perfectly aligned.
astro-ph.GA:Dust properties appear to vary according to the environment in which the dust evolves. Previous observational indications of these variations in the FIR and submm spectral range are scarce and limited to specific regions of the sky. To determine whether these results can be generalised to larger scales, we study the evolution in dust emissivities from the FIR to mm wavelengths, in the atomic and molecular ISM, along the Galactic plane towards the outer Galaxy. We correlate the dust FIR to mm emission with the HI and CO emission. The study is carried out using the DIRBE data from 100 to 240 mic, the Archeops data from 550 mic to 2.1 mm, and the WMAP data at 3.2 mm (W band), in regions with Galactic latitude |b| < 30 deg, over the Galactic longitude range (75 deg < l < 198 deg) observed with Archeops. In all regions studied, the emissivity spectra in both the atomic and molecular phases are steeper in the FIR (beta = 2.4) than in the submm and mm (beta = 1.5). We find significant variations in the spectral shape of the dust emissivity as a function of the dust temperature in the molecular phase. Regions of similar dust temperature in the molecular and atomic gas exhibit similar emissivity spectra. Regions where the dust is significantly colder in the molecular phase show a significant increase in emissivity for the range 100 - 550 mic. This result supports the hypothesis of grain coagulation in these regions, confirming results obtained over small fractions of the sky in previous studies and allowing us to expand these results to the cold molecular environments in general of the outer MW. We note that it is the first time that these effects have been demonstrated by direct measurement of the emissivity, while previous studies were based only on thermal arguments.
astro-ph.GA:The 3MdB (Mexican Million Models database) is a large database of photoionization models for H II regions. The number of free parameters for the models is close to 15, including the description of the ionizing Spectral Energy Distribution (effective temperature, luminosity, surface gravity, for different type of stellar atmosphere models) and the description of the ionized gas (distance to the ionizing source, density, abundances of the most common elements, dust). The outputs of the models are more than 70 emission line intensities, the ionic fractions and temperatures. All the parameters and outputs are included in the MySQL database, giving the possibility to the user to search into the database for example for all the models that reproduce a given set of observations.
astro-ph.GA:We present MSX two-color diagrams that can be used to characterize circumstellar environments of sources with good quality MSX colors in terms of IRAS color regions for oxygen-rich stars. With these diagrams we aim to provide a new tool that can be used to study circumstellar environments and to improve detection rates for targeted surveys for circumstellar maser emission similar to the IRAS two-color diagram. This new tool is especially useful for regions in the sky where IRAS was confused, in particular in the Galactic plane and bulge region. Unfortunately, using MSX colors alone does not allow to distinguish between carbon-rich and oxygen-rich objects. An application of this tool on 86 GHz SiO masers shows that for this type of masers an instantaneous detection rate of 60% to 80% can be achieved if target sources are selected according to MSX color (region).   Our investigations may have revealed an error in the MSX point source catalog version 2.3. That is, the photometry of the 21.3 $\mu$m (MSX E filter) band for most weak 8.28 $\mu$m (or MSX A filter) band sources seems off by about a factor two (0.5--1 magnitude too bright).
astro-ph.GA:We find that a steady state bar induces transient features at low velocities in the solar neighborhood velocity distribution due to the initial response of the disc, following the formation of the bar. We associate these velocity streams with two quasi-periodic orbital families, librating around the stable x_1(1) and x_1(2) orbits near the bar's outer Lindblad resonance (OLR). In a reference frame moving with the bar, these otherwise stationary orbits precess on a timescale dependent on the strength of the bar, consistent with predictions from a simple Hamiltonian model for the resonance. This behavior allows the two orbital families to reach the solar neighborhood and manifest themselves as clumps in the u-v plane moving away from (x_1(2)), and toward (x_1(1)) the Galactic center. Depending on the bar parameters and time since its formation, this model is consistent with the Pleiades and Coma Berenices, or Pleiades and Sirius moving groups seen in the Hipparcos stellar velocity distribution, if the Milky Way bar angle is 30<phi_0<45 [deg] and its pattern speed is Omega_b/Omega_0=1.82\pm 0.07, where Omega_0 is the angular velocity of the local standard of rest (LSR). Since the process is recurrent, we can achieve a good match about every six LSR rotations. However, to be consistent with the fraction of stars in the Pleiades, we estimate that the Milky Way bar formed ~2 Gyr ago. This model argues against a common dynamical origin for the Hyades and Pleiades moving groups.
astro-ph.GA:We present a theoretical investigation of the effect of multiple ionisation sources in HII regions on the total elemental abundances derived from the analysis of collisionally excited emission lines. We focus on empirical methods based on direct temperature measurements that are commonly employed in cases when the temperature of the nebular gas can be determined from the ratio of nebular to auroral lines of (e.g.) doubly ionised oxygen. We find that direct temperature methods that employ a two-temperature zone approach (DT2T methods) are very robust against the spatial distribution of sources. Errors smaller than 0.15 dex are estimated for regions where the metallicity is twice solar and errors below 0.05 dex for solar metallicities and below. The biases introduced by the spatial distribution of the ionisation sources are thus much smaller for DT2T methods than for strong line methods, previously investigated by Ercolano, Bastian & Stasinska. Our findings are in agreement with the recent study of HII regions in NGC 300 by Bresolin et al.
astro-ph.GA:We present and analyze kinematics and orbits for a sample of 488 open clusters in the Galaxy. The velocity ellipsoid for our present sample is derived as ($\sigma_{U}$, $\sigma_{V}$, $\sigma_{W})$=$(28.7$, 15.8, 11.0) km s$^{-1}$ which represents a young thin disc population. We also confirm that the velocity dispersions increase with the age of cluster subsample. The orbits of open clusters are calculated with three Galactic gravitational potential models. The errors of orbital parameters are also calculated considering the intrinsic variation of the orbital parameters and the effects of observational uncertainties. The observational uncertainties dominate the errors of derived orbital parameters. The vertical motions of clusters calculated using different Galactic disc models are rather different. The observed radial metallicity gradient of clusters is derived with a slope of $b=-0.070\pm0.011$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The radial metallicity gradient of clusters based on their apogalactic distances is also derived with a slope of $b=-0.082\pm0.014$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The distribution of derived orbital eccentricities for open clusters is very similar to the one derived for the field population of dwarfs and giants in the thin disc.
astro-ph.GA:We report a trigonometric parallax of 12 GHz methanol masers associated with the massive star forming region G9.62+0.20, corresponding to a distance of 5.2+-0.6 kpc. With a local standard of rest velocity of about 2 km/s, the region's kinematic distances of 0.5 and 16 kpc differ greatly from the distance derived here. Our measurement of the peculiar motion of the star forming region shows a very large deviation from a circular Galactic orbit: 41 km/s radially outward from the Galactic center and 60 km/s counter to Galactic rotation. The combination of its radial velocity and distance places G9.62+0.20 in the inner region of the Galaxy close to the Expanding Near 3 kpc-Arm, where the bulge/bar potential has strong gravitational influence. We also map the distribution of 12 GHz methanol masers, locate them with respect to a hypercompact H II region, and compare our data with the periodic flare phenomenon reported previously for this source.
astro-ph.GA:We present results from the Spitzer Space Telescope and molecular line observations of 9 species toward the dark cloud L43. The Spitzer images and molecular line maps suggest it has a starless core and a Class I protostar evolving in the same environment. CO depletion is seen in both sources, and DCO+ lines are stronger toward the starless core. With a goal of testing the chemical characteristics from pre- to protostellar stages, we adopt an evolutionary chemical model to calculate the molecular abundances and compare with our observations. Among the different model parameters we tested, the best-fit model suggests a longer total timescale at the pre-protostellar stage, but with faster evolution at the later steps with higher densities.
astro-ph.GA:This study is an investigation of the stellar density profile of the Galactic disc in the Anticentre direction. We select over 40,000 early A stars from IPHAS photometry in the Galactic longitude range 160 < l < 200 close to the equatorial plane (-1 < b < +1). We then compare their observed reddening-corrected apparent magnitude distribution with simulated photometry obtained from parameterised models in order to set constraints on the Anticentre stellar density profile. By selecting A stars, we are appraising the properties of a population only ~100 Myrs old. We find the stellar density profile of young stars is well fit to an exponential with length scale of (3020 \pm 120_{statistical} \pm 180_{systematic}) pc, which is comparable to that obtained in earlier studies, out to a Galactocentric radius of R_T = (13.0 \pm 0.5_{statistical} \pm 0.6_{systematic}) kpc. At larger radii the rate of decline appears to increase with the scale length dropping to (1200 \pm 300_{statistical} \pm 70_{systematic}) pc. This result amounts to a refinement of the conclusions reached in previous studies that the stellar density profile is abruptly truncated. The IPHAS A star data are not compatible with models that propose a sudden change in metallicity at R_G = 10 kpc.
astro-ph.GA:This study presents the mass distribution for a sample of 18 late-type galaxies in nine Hickson Compact Groups. We used rotation curves from high resolution 2D velocity fields of Fabry-Perot observations and J-band photometry from the 2MASS survey, in order to determine the dark halo and the visible matter distributions. The study compares two halo density profile, an isothermal core-like distribution and a cuspy one. We also compare their visible and dark matter distributions with those of galaxies belonging to cluster and field galaxies coming from two samples: 40 cluster galaxies of Barnes et al (2004) and 35 field galaxies of Spano et al. (2008). The central halo surface density is found to be constant with respect to the total absolute magnitude similar to what is found for the isolated galaxies. This suggests that the halo density is independent to galaxy type and environment. We have found that core-like density profiles fit better the rotation curves than cuspy-like ones. No major differences have been found between field, cluster and compact group galaxies with respect to their dark halo density profiles.
astro-ph.GA:Surface brightness profiles for 23 M31 star clusters were measured using images from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope, and fit to two types of models to determine the clusters' structural properties. The clusters are primarily young (~10^8 yr) and massive (~10^4.5 solar masses), with median half-light radius 7 pc and dissolution times of a few Gyr. The properties of the M31 clusters are comparable to those of clusters of similar age in the Magellanic Clouds. Simulated star clusters are used to derive a conversion from statistical measures of cluster size to half-light radius so that the extragalactic clusters can be compared to young massive clusters in the Milky Way. All three sets of star clusters fall approximately on the same age-size relation. The young M31 clusters are expected to dissolve within a few Gyr and will not survive to become old, globular clusters. However, they do appear to follow the same fundamental plane relations as old clusters; if confirmed with velocity dispersion measurements, this would be a strong indication that the star cluster fundamental plane reflects universal cluster formation conditions.
astro-ph.GA:It is well known that non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects are important in the dynamics of molecular clouds: both ambipolar diffusion and possibly the Hall effect have been identified as significant. We present the results of a suite of simulations with a resolution of 512-cubed of turbulent decay in molecular clouds incorporating a simplified form of both ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect simultaneously. The initial velocity field in the turbulence is varied from being super-Alfv\'enic and hypersonic, through to trans-Alfv\'enic but still supersonic.   We find that ambipolar diffusion increases the rate of decay of the turbulence increasing the decay from $t^{-1.25}$ to $t^{-1.4}$. The Hall effect has virtually no impact in this regard. The power spectra of density, velocity and the magnetic field are all affected by the non-ideal terms, being steepened significantly when compared with ideal MHD turbulence with exponents. The density power spectra components change from about 1.4 to about 2.1 for the ideal and non-ideal simulations respectively, and power spectra of the other variables all show similar modifications when non-ideal effects are considered. Again, the dominant source of these changes is ambipolar diffusion rather than the Hall effect. There is also a decoupling between the velocity field and the magnetic field at short length scales. The Hall effect leads to enhanced magnetic reconnection, and hence less power, at short length scales. The dependence of the velocity dispersion on the characteristic length scale is studied and found not to be power-law in nature.
astro-ph.GA:We calculate a series of synthetic X-ray spectra from outflows originating from the obscuring torus in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Such modeling includes 2.5D hydrodynamical simulations of an X-ray excited torus wind, including the effects of X-ray heating, ionization, and radiation pressure. 3D radiation transfer calculations are performed in the 3D Sobolev approximation. Synthetic X-ray line spectra and individual profiles of several strong lines are shown at different inclination angles, observing times, and for different characteristics of the torus.   Our calculations show that rich synthetic warm absorber spectra from 3D modeling are typically observed at a larger range of inclinations than was previously inferred from simple analysis of the transmitted spectra. In general, our results are supportive of warm absorber models based on the hypothesis of an "X-ray excited funnel flow" and are consistent with characteristics of such flows inferred from observations of warm absorbers from Seyfert 1 galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:We aim to investigate the chemistry and gas phase abundance of HNCO and the variation of the HNCO/CS abundance ratio as a diagnostic of the physics and chemistry in regions of massive star formation. A numerical-chemical model has been developed which self-consistently follows the chemical evolution of a hot core. The model comprises of two distinct stages. An initial collapse phase is immediately followed by an increase in temperature which represents the switch on of a central massive star and the subsequent evolution of the chemistry in a hot, dense gas cloud (the hot core). During the collapse phase, gas species are allowed to accrete on to grain surfaces where they can participate in further reactions. During the hot core phase surface species thermally desorb back in to the ambient gas and further chemical evolution takes place. For comparison, the chemical network was also used to model a simple dark cloud and photodissociation regions. Our investigation reveals that HNCO is inefficiently formed when only gas-phase formation pathways are considered in the chemical network with reaction rates consistent with existing laboratory data. Using currently measured gas phase reaction rates, obtaining the observed HNCO abundances requires its formation on grain surfaces. However our model shows that the gas phase HNCO in hot cores is not a simple direct product of the evaporation of grain mantles. We also show that the HNCO/CS abundance ratio varies as a function of time in hot cores and can match the range of values observed. This ratio is not unambiguously related to the ambient UV field as been suggested - our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis of Martin et al (2008). In addition, our results show that this ratio is extremely sensitive to the initial sulphur abundance.
astro-ph.GA:Our knowledge about the chemical evolution of the more luminous dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies is constantly growing. However, little is known about the enrichment of the ultrafaint systems recently discovered in large numbers in large Sky Surveys. Low-resolution spectroscopy and photometric data indicate that these galaxies are predominantly metal-poor. On the other hand, the most recent high-resolution abundance analyses indicate that some of these galaxies experienced highly inhomogenous chemical enrichment, where star formation proceeds locally on the smallest scales. Furthermore, these galaxy-contenders appear to contain very metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]<-3 dex and could be the sites of the first stars. Here, we consider the presently available chemical abundance information of the (ultra-) faint Milky Way satellite dSphs. In this context, some of the most peculiar element and inhomogeneous enrichment patterns will be discussed and related to the question of to what extent the faintest dSph candidates and outer halo globular clusters could have contributed to the metal-poor Galactic halo.
astro-ph.GA:The dust feature G159.6--18.5 in the Perseus region has previously been observed with the COSMOSOMAS experiment \citep{Watson:05} on angular scales of $\approx$ 1$^{\circ}$, and was found to exhibit anomalous microwave emission. We present new observations of this dust feature, performed with the Very Small Array (VSA) at 33 GHz, to help increase the understanding of the nature of this anomalous emission.   On the angular scales observed with the VSA ($\approx$ 10 -- 40$^{\prime}$), G159.6--18.5 consists of five distinct components, each of which have been individually analysed. All five of these components are found to exhibit an excess of emission at 33 GHz, and are found to be highly correlated with far-infrared emission. We provide evidence that each of these compact components have anomalous emission that is consistent with electric dipole emission from very small, rapidly rotating dust grains. These components contribute $\approx$ 10 % to the flux density of the diffuse extended emission detected by COSMOSOMAS, and are found to have a similar radio emissivity.
astro-ph.GA:We report on optical integral field spectroscopy of two unrelated blue compact galaxies mapped with the 13 x 13 arcsec^2 VIMOS integral field unit at a resolution of 0.33 x 0.33 arcsec^2. Continuum and background subtracted emission line maps in the light of [O III] 5007, H-alpha, and [N II] 6584 are presented. Both galaxies display signs of ongoing perturbation and/or interaction. UM 420 is resolved for the first time to be a merging system composed of two starbursting components with an 'arm-like' structure associated with the largest component. UM 462 which is a disrupted system of irregular morphology is resolved into at least four starbursting regions. Maps of the H-alpha radial velocity and FWHM are discussed. No underlying broad line region was detected from either galaxy as the emission lines are well-fitted with single Gaussian profiles only. Electron temperatures and densities as well as the abundances of helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur were computed from spectra integrated over the whole galaxies and for each area of recent star formation. Maps of the O/H ratio are presented: these galaxies show oxygen abundances that are ~20 per cent solar. No evidence of substantial abundance variations across the galaxies that would point to significant nitrogen or oxygen self-enrichment is found (<0.2 dex limit). Contrary to previous observations, this analysis does not support the classification of these BCGs as Wolf-Rayet galaxies as the characteristic broad emission line features have not been detected in our spectra. Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich emission line ratio diagrams which were constructed on a pixel by pixel basis indicate that the optical spectra of these systems are predominantly excited by stellar photoionization.
astro-ph.GA:Images from the HST ACS are used to carry out a new photometric study of the globular clusters (GCs) in M104, the Sombrero galaxy. The primary focus of our study is the characteristic distribution function of linear sizes (SDF) of the GCs. We measure the effective radii for 652 clusters with PSF-convolved King and Wilson dynamical model fits. The SDF is remarkably similar to those measured for other large galaxies of all types, adding strong support to the view that it is a "universal" feature of globular cluster systems.   We develop a more general interpretation of the size distribution function for globular clusters, proposing that the shape of the SDF that we see today for GCs is strongly influenced by the early rapid mass loss during their star forming stage, coupled with stochastic differences from cluster to cluster in the star formation efficiency (SFE) and their initial sizes. We find that the observed SDF shape can be accurately predicted by a simple model in which the protocluster clouds had characteristic sizes of $0.9 \pm 0.1$ pc and SFEs of $0.3 \pm 0.07$. The colors and luminosities of the M104 clusters show the clearly defined classic bimodal form. The blue sequence exhibits a mass/metallicity relation (MMR), following a scaling of heavy-element abundance with luminosity of $Z \sim L^{0.3}$ very similar to what has been found in most giant elliptical galaxies. A quantitative self-enrichment model provides a good first-order match to the data for the same initial SFE and protocluster size that were required to explain the SDF. We also discuss various forms of the globular cluster Fundamental Plane (FP) of structural parameters, and show that useful tests of it can be extended to galaxies beyond the Local Group.
astro-ph.GA:We describe an ultraviolet spectroscopic survey of interstellar high-velocity cloud (HVC) absorption in the strong 1206.500 Angstrom line of Si III using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Because the Si III line is 4-5 times stronger than O VI 1031.926, it provides a sensitive probe of ionized gas down to column densities N(Si III) = 5x10^11 cm^-2 at Si III equivalent width 10 mA. We detect high-velocity Si III over (91+/-4)% of the sky (53 of 58 sight lines), and 59% of the HVCs show negative LSR velocities. Per sight line, the mean HVC column density is <log N(SiIII)> = 13.19 +/- 0.45, while the mean for all 90 velocity components is 12.92 +/- 0.46. Lower limits due to Si III line saturation are included in this average, so the actual mean/median values are even higher. The Si III appears to trace an extensive ionized component of Galactic halo gas at temperatures 10^4.0 K to 10^4.5 K indicative of a cooling flow. Photoionization models suggest that typical Si III absorbers with 12.5 < log N(Si III) < 13.5 have total hydrogen column densities N(H) = 10^18 to 10^19 cm^-2 for gas of hydrogen density n(H) = 0.1 cm^(-3) and 10% solar metallicity. With typical neutral fractions N(HI)/N(H) = 0.01, these HVCs may elude even long duration 21-cm observations at Arecibo, the EVLA, and other radio facilities. However, if Si III is associated with higher density gas, n(H) > 1 cm^(-3), the corresponding neutral hydrogen could be visible in deep observations. This reservoir of ionized gas may contain 10^8 M_sun and produce a mass infall rate of 1 M_sun/yr to the Galactic disk.
astro-ph.GA:This article presents high-resolution interferometric mosaics in the 850 micron waveband of two massive, quiescent infrared dark clouds. The two clouds were chosen based on their likelihood to represent environments preceding the formation of massive stars. The brightest compact sources detected in each cloud have masses of approximately 110 and 60 solar masses with radii < 0.1 pc, implying mean volume densities of approximately 1 million particles per cubic centimeter and mean column densities of about 1 gram per square centimeter. Supplementary data show these cores to be cold and inactive. Low upper limits to their bolometric luminosities and temperatures place them at a very early stage of evolution while current models of massive star formation suggest they have the potential to form massive stars.
astro-ph.GA:We expand our study on the dispersion of polarization angles in molecular clouds. We show how the effect of signal integration through the thickness of the cloud as well as across the area subtended by the telescope beam inherent to dust continuum measurements can be incorporated in our analysis to correctly account for its effect on the measured angular dispersion and inferred turbulent to large-scale magnetic field strength ratio. We further show how to evaluate the turbulent magnetic field correlation scale from polarization data of sufficient spatial resolution and high enough spatial sampling rate. We apply our results to the molecular cloud OMC-1, where we find a turbulent correlation length of approximately 16 mpc, a turbulent to large-scale magnetic field strength ratio of approximately 0.5, and a plane-of-the-sky large-scale magnetic field strength of approximately 0.76 mG.
astro-ph.GA:Intermediate resolution spectra at the Ca II triplet have been obtained for 55 candidate red giants in the field of the globular cluster M22 with the VLT/FORS instrument. Spectra were also obtained for a number of red giants in standard globular clusters to provide a calibration of the observed line strengths with overall abundance [Fe/H]. For the 41 M22 member stars that lie within the V-V_HB bounds of the calibration, we find an abundance distribution that is substantially broader than that expected from the observed errors alone. We argue that this broad distribution cannot be the result of differential reddening. Instead we conclude that, as has long been suspected, M22 is similar to omega Cen in having an intrinsic dispersion in heavy element abundance. The observed M22 abundance distribution rises sharply to a peak at [Fe/H] = -1.9 with a broad tail to higher abundances: the highest abundance star in our sample has [Fe/H] = -1.45 dex. If the unusual properties of omega Cen have their origin in a scenario in which the cluster is the remnant nucleus of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, then such a scenario likely applies also to M22.
astro-ph.GA:We report here on two years of timing of 168 pulsars using the Parkes radio telescope. The vast majority of these pulsars have spin-down luminosities in excess of 10^34 erg/s and are prime target candidates to be detected in gamma-rays by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We provide the ephemerides for the ten pulsars being timed at Parkes which have been detected by Fermi in its first year of operation. These ephemerides, in conjunction with the publicly available photon list, can be used to generate gamma-ray profiles from the Fermi archive. We will make the ephemerides of any pulsars of interest available to the community upon request. In addition to the timing ephemerides, we present the parameters for 14 glitches which have occurred in 13 pulsars, seven of which have no previously known glitch history. The Parkes timing programme, in conjunction with Fermi observations, is expected to continue for at least the next four years.
astro-ph.GA:The 2004 December 27 giant flare from SGR 1806-20 produced a radio nebula that was detectable for weeks. It was observed at a wide range of radio frequencies. We made a total of 19 WSRT observations. Most of these were performed quasi simultaneously at either two or three frequencies, starting 2005 January 4 and ending 2005 January 29. We reobserved the field in 2005 April/May, which facilitated an accurate subtraction of background sources.   At 350 MHz, we find that the total intensity of the source is lower than expected from the GMRT 240 MHz and 610 MHz measurements and inconsistent with spectral indices published previously. Our 850 MHz flux densities, however, are consistent with earlier results. There is no compelling evidence for significant depolarization at any frequency. We do, however, find that polarization angles differ substantially from those at higher frequencies.   Low frequency polarimetry and total intensity measurements provide a number of clues with regard to substructure in the radio nebula associated with SGR 1806-20. In general, for a more complete understanding of similar events, low frequency observations can provide new insights into the physics of the radio source.
astro-ph.GA:We present a characterization method based on spectral cross-correlation to obtain the physical parameters of the controversial stellar aggregate ESO442-SC04. The data used was obtained with GMOS at Gemini-South telescope including 17 stars in the central region of the ob ject and 6 standard-stars. FXCOR was used in an iterative process to obtain self-consistent radial velocities for the standard-stars and averaged radial velocities for the science spectra. Spectral types, effective temperature, suface gravity and metallicities parameters were determined using FXCOR to correlate cluster spectra with ELODIE spectral library and selecting the best correlation matches using the Tonry and Davis Ratio (TDR). Analysis of the results suggests that the stars in ESO442-SC04 are not bound and therefore they do not constitute a physical system.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the ratio between the half-mass radii r_h of Galactic globular clusters and their Jacobi radii r_J given by the potential of the Milky Way and show that clusters with galactocentric distances R_{GC}>8 kpc fall into two distinct groups: one group of compact, tidally-underfilling clusters with r_h/r_J<0.05 and another group of tidally filling clusters which have 0.1 < r_h/r_J<0.3. We find no correlation between the membership of a particular cluster to one of these groups and its membership in the old or younger halo population. Based on the relaxation times and orbits of the clusters, we argue that compact clusters and most clusters in the inner Milky Way were born compact with half-mass radii r_h < 1 pc. Some of the tidally-filling clusters might have formed compact as well, but the majority likely formed with large half-mass radii. Galactic globular clusters therefore show a similar dichotomy as was recently found for globular clusters in dwarf galaxies and for young star clusters in the Milky Way. It seems likely that some of the tidally-filling clusters are evolving along the main sequence line of clusters recently discovered by Kuepper et al. (2008) and are in the process of dissolution.
astro-ph.GA:The open clusters fundamental physical parameters are important tools to understand the formation and evolution of the Galactic disk and as grounding tests for star formation and evolution models. However only a small fraction of the known open clusters in the Milky Way has precise determination of distance, reddening, age, metallicity, radial velocity and proper motion. One of the major problems in determining these parameters lies on the difficulty to separate cluster members from field stars and to assign membership. We propose a decontamination method by employing 2MASS data in the encircling region of the clusters NGC1981, NGC2516, NGC6494 and M11. We present a decontaminated CMD of these objects showing the membership probabilities and structural parameters as derived from King profile fitting.
astro-ph.GA:Emission from the 6.7 GHz methanol maser transition is very strong, is relatively stable, has small internal motions, and is observed toward numerous massive star-forming regions in the Galaxy. Our goal is to perform high-precision astrometry using this maser transition to obtain accurate distances to their host regions. Eight strong masers were observed during five epochs of VLBI observations with the European VLBI Network between 2006 June, and 2008 March. We report trigonometric parallaxes for five star-forming regions, with accuracies as good as $\sim22 \mathrm{\mu}$as. Distances to these sources are $2.57^{+0.34}_{-0.27}$ kpc for ON 1, $0.776^{+0.104}_{-0.083}$ kpc for L 1206, $0.929^{+0.034}_{-0.033}$ kpc for L 1287, $2.38^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ kpc for NGC 281-W, and $1.59^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ kpc for S 255. The distances and proper motions yield the full space motions of the star-forming regions hosting the masers, and we find that these regions lag circular rotation on average by $\sim$17 km s$^{-1}$, a value comparable to those found recently by similar studies.
astro-ph.GA:Based on ideas by Woodward et al., a subgrid scale model that is applicable to highly compressible turbulence is presented. Applying the subgrid scale model in large eddy simulations of forced supersonic turbulence, the bottleneck effect is largely reduced and, thereby, approximate scaling laws can be obtained at relatively low numerical resolution. In agreement with previous results from PPM simulations without explicit subgrid scale model, it is found that the energy spectrum function for the velocity field with fractional density-weighing, rho^(1/3)u, varies substantially with the forcing, at least for the decade of wavenumbers next to the energy-containing range. Consequently, if universal scaling of compressible turbulence exists, it can be found on length scales much smaller than the forcing scale only.
astro-ph.GA:Much of our understanding of dark matter halos comes from the assumption that the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of spiral disks is constant. The best way to test this hypothesis is to measure the disk surface mass density directly via the kinematics of old disk stars. To this end, we have used planetary nebulae (PNe) as test particles and have measured the vertical velocity dispersion (sigma_z) throughout the disks of five nearby, low-inclination spiral galaxies: IC 342, M74 (NGC 628), M83 (NGC 5236), M94 (NGC 4736), and M101 (NGC 5457). By using HI to map galactic rotation and the epicyclic approximation to extract sigma_z from the line-of-sight dispersion, we find that, with the lone exception of M101, our disks do have a constant M/L out to ~3 optical scale lengths. However, once outside this radius, sigma_z stops declining and becomes flat with radius. Possible explanations for this behavior include an increase in the disk mass-to-light ratio, an increase in the importance of the thick disk, and heating of the thin disk by halo substructure. We also find that the disks of early type spirals have higher values of M/L and are closer to maximal than the disks of later-type spirals, and that the unseen inner halos of these systems are better fit by pseudo-isothermal laws than by NFW models.
astro-ph.GA:We studied Faraday rotation measure (RM) in turbulent media with the rms Mach number of unity, using isothermal, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. Four cases with different values of initial plasma beta were considered. Our main findings are as follows. (1) There is no strong correlation between the fluctuations of magnetic field strength and gas density. So the magnetic field strength estimated with RM/DM (DM is the dispersion measure) correctly represents the true mean strength of the magnetic field along the line of sight. (2) The frequency distribution of RMs is well fitted to the Gaussian. In addition, there is a good relation between the width of the distribution of RM/$\bar{\rm RM}$ ($\bar{\rm RM}$ is the average value of RMs) and the strength of the regular field along the line of sight; the width is narrower, if the field strength is stronger. We discussed the implications of our findings in the warm ionized medium where the Mach number of turbulent motions is around unity.
astro-ph.GA:The Aquarius project is the first simulation that can resolve the full mass range of potential globular cluster formation sites. With a particle mass $m_\mathrm{p}=1.4 \times 10^4$\Msun, Aquarius yields more than 100 million particles within the virial radius of the central halo which has a mass of $1.8 \times 10^{12}$\Msun, similar to that of the Milky Way. With this particle mass, dark matter concentrations (haloes) as small as 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ will contain a minimum of 100 particles.Here, we use this simulation to test a model of metal-poor globular cluster formation based on collapse physics. In our model, globular clusters form when the virial temperatures of haloes first exceed $10^4$ K as this is when electronic transitions allow the gas to cool efficiently. We calculate the ionising flux from the stars in these first clusters and stop the formation of new clusters when all the baryonic gas of the galaxy is ionised. This is achieved by adopting reasonable values for the star formation efficiencies and escape fraction of ionising photons. The model is successful in that it predicts ages (peak age $\sim$ 13.3 Gyrs) and a spatial distribution of metal-poor globular clusters which are consistent with the observed populations in the Milky Way. We then test a scenario of metal-rich cluster formation by examining mergers that trigger star formation within central gas disks. This results in younger ($\sim$ 7--13.3 Gyrs), more centrally-located clusters (40 metal-rich GCs within 18 kpc from the centre of the host) which are consistent with the Galactic metal-rich population. We test an alternate model in which metal-rich globular clusters form in dwarf galaxies that become stripped as they merge with the main halo. We find that this process is inconsistent with observed metal-rich globulars.
astro-ph.GA:Supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds is a dominant agent that strongly affects the clouds' evolution and star formation activity. Turbulence may be initiated and maintained by a number of processes, acting at a wide range of physical scales. By examining the dynamical state of molecular clouds, it is possible to assess the primary candidates for how the turbulent energy is injected. The aim of this paper is to constrain the scales at which turbulence is driven in the molecular interstellar medium, by comparing simulated molecular spectral line observations of numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and molecular spectral line observations of real molecular clouds. We use principal component analysis, applied to both models and observational data, to extract a quantitative measure of the driving scale of turbulence. We find that only models driven at large scales (comparable to, or exceeding, the size of the cloud) are consistent with observations. This result applies also to clouds with little or no internal star formation activity. Astrophysical processes acting on large scales, including supernova-driven turbulence, magnetorotational instability, or spiral shock forcing, are viable candidates for the generation and maintenance of molecular cloud turbulence. Small scale driving by sources internal to molecular clouds, such as outflows, can be important on small scales, but cannot replicate the observed large-scale velocity fluctuations in the molecular interstellar medium.
astro-ph.GA:The kinematics of the extra-planar neutral and ionised gas in disc galaxies shows a systematic decline of the rotational velocity with height from the plane (vertical gradient). This feature is not expected for a barotropic gas, whilst it is well reproduced by baroclinic fluid homogeneous models. The problem with the latter is that they require gas temperatures (above $10^5$ K) much higher than the temperatures of the cold and warm components of the extra-planar gas layer. In this paper, we attempt to overcome this problem by describing the extra-planar gas as a system of gas clouds obeying the Jeans equations. In particular, we consider models having the observed extra-planar gas distribution and gravitational potential of the disc galaxy NGC 891: for each model we construct pseudo-data cubes and we compare them with the HI data cube of NGC 891. In all cases the rotational velocity gradients are in qualitative agreement with the observations, but the synthetic and the observed data cubes of NGC 891 show systematic differences that cannot be accommodated by any of the explored models. We conclude that the extra-planar gas in disc galaxies cannot be satisfactorily described by a stationary Jeans-like system of gas clouds.
astro-ph.GA:It is debated whether the Milky Way bulge has the characteristics of a classical bulge sooner than those of a pseudobulge. Detailed abundance studies of bulge stars is a key to investigate the origin, history, and classification of the bulge. The aim is to add to the discussion on the origin of the bulge and to study detailed abundances determined from near-IR spectra for bulge giants already investigated with optical spectra, the latter also providing the stellar parameters which are very significant for the results of the present study. Especially, the important CNO elements are better determined in the near-IR. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra in the H band are recorded using the CRIRES spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope. The CNO abundances can all be determined from the numerous molecular lines in the wavelength range observed. Abundances of the alpha elements are also determined from the near-IR spectra. [O/Fe], [Si/Fe] and [S/Fe] are enhanced up to metallicities of at least [Fe/H]=-0.3, after which they decline. This suggests that the Milky Way bulge experienced a rapid and early star-formation history like that of a classical bulge. However, a similarity between the bulge trend and the trend of the local thick disk seems present. Such a similarity could suggest that the bulge has a pseudobulge origin. Our [C/Fe] trend does not show any increase with [Fe/H] which could have been expected if W-R stars have contributed substantially to the C abundances. No "cosmic scatter" can be traced around our observed abundance trends; the scatter found is expected, given the observational uncertainties.
astro-ph.GA:In order to investigate when and how the birth of a protostellar core occurs, we made survey observations of four well-studied dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud using CO transitions in submillimeter bands. We report here the detection of unexpectedly warm (~ 30 - 70 K), extended (radius of ~ 2400 AU), dense (a few times 10^{5} cm^{-3}) gas at the heart of one of the dense cores, L1521F (MC27), within the cold dynamically collapsing components. We argue that the detected warm, extended, dense gas may originate from shock regions caused by collisions between the dynamically collapsing components and outflowing/rotating components within the dense core. We propose a new stage of star formation, "warm-in-cold core stage (WICCS)", i.e., the cold collapsing envelope encases the warm extended dense gas at the center due to the formation of a protostellar core. WICCS would constitutes a missing link in evolution between a cold quiescent starless core and a young protostar in class 0 stage that has a large-scale bipolar outflow.
astro-ph.GA:We use N-body simulations to study the effects of tides on the kinematical structure of satellite galaxies orbiting a Milky Way-like potential. Our work is motivated by observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group, for which often a distinction is possible between a cold centrally concentrated metal rich and a hot, extended metal poor population. We find that an important attenuation of the initial differences in the distribution of the two stellar components occurs for orbits with small pericentric radii (r_per < 20 kpc). This is mainly due to: i) the loss of the gravitational support provided by the dark matter component after tidal stripping takes place, which forces a re-configuration of the luminous components, and ii) tides preferentially affect the more extended stellar component, leading to a net decrease in its velocity dispersion as a response for the mass loss, which thus shrinks the kinematical gap. We apply these ideas to the Sculptor and Carina dwarf spheroidals. Differences in their orbits might help to explain, under the assumption of similar initial configurations, why in the former a clear kinematical separation between metal poor and metal rich stars is apparent, while in Carina this segregation is significantly more subtle.
astro-ph.GA:We summarize our optical monitoring program of VY Scl stars with the SMARTS telescopes, and triggered X-ray as well as optical observations after/during state transitions of V504 Cen and VY Scl.
astro-ph.GA:We present 737 candidate Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) near the W51 Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) over an area of 1.25 deg x 1.00 deg selected from Spitzer Space Telescope data. We use spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to identify YSOs and distinguish them from main-sequence or red giant stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, and background galaxies. Based on extinction of each YSO, we separate a total of 437 YSOs associated with the W51 region from the possible foreground sources. We identify 69 highly embedded Stage 0/I candidate YSOs in our field with masses > 5 Msun (corresponding to mid-to early-B main-sequence spectral types) 46 of which are located in the central active star forming regions of W51A and W51B. From the YSOs associated with W51, we find evidence for mass segregation showing that the most massive YSOs are concentrated on the W51 HII region complex. We find a variation in the spatial distribution of the mass function (MF) of YSOs in the mass range between 5 Msun and 18 Msun. The derived slopes of the MF are -1.26 and -2.36 in the active star-forming region and the outer region, respectively. The variation of the MF for YSOs embedded in the molecular cloud implies that the distribution of stellar masses in clusters depends on the local conditions in the parent molecular cloud.
astro-ph.GA:(Abridged) The present number of Galactic Open Clusters that have high-resolution abundance determinations, not only of [Fe/H], but also of other key elements, is largely insufficient to enable a clear modeling of the Galactic Disk chemical evolution. We obtained high-resolution (R~30000), high quality (S/N~50-100 per pixel), echelle spectra with FOCES, at Calar Alto, for 3 red clump stars in each of five Open Clusters. We used the classical Equivalent Width analysis method to obtain accurate abundances of 16 elements. We also derived the oxygen abundance through spectral synthesis of the 6300A forbidden line. Three of the clusters were never studied previously with high-resolution: we found [Fe/H]=+0.03 +/- 0.02 dex for Cr110; [Fe/H]=+0.01 +/- 0.05 dex for NGC2099 (M37) and [Fe/H]=-0.05 +/- 0.03 dex for NGC2420. For the remaining clusters, we find: [Fe/H]=+0.05 +/- 0.02 dex for M67 and [Fe/H]=+0.04 +/- 0.07 dex for NGC7789. We provide the first high-resolution based velocity estimate for Cr110, V=41.0 +/- 3.8 km/s. All our programme stars show abundance patterns typical of open clusters. Also, no significant sign of (anti-)correlations is found. We then compile high-resolution data of 57 clusters from the literature and we find a gradient of [Fe/H] with Galactocentric Radius of -0.06 +/- 0.02 dex/kpc, in agreement with past work. A change of slope is seen outside RGC=12 kpc and [alpha/Fe] shows a tendency of increasing with RGC. We also confirm the absence of a significant Age-Metallicity relation.
astro-ph.GA:(...) We search for an explanation of the disagreement between the observed integrated colours of 650 local Galactic clusters and the theoretical colours of present-day SSP models. We check the hypothesis that the systematic offsets between observed and theoretical colours, which are $(B$$-$$V)\approx 0.3$ and $(J$$-$$K_s)\approx 0.8$, are caused by neglecting the discrete nature of the underlying mass function. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we construct artificial clusters of coeval stars taken from a mass distribution defined by an Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and compare them with corresponding "continuous-IMF" SSP models. If the discreteness of the IMF is taken into account, the model fits the observations perfectly and is able to explain naturally a number of red "outliers" observed in the empirical colour-age relation. We find that the \textit{systematic} offset between the continuous- and discrete-IMF colours reaches its maximum of about 0.5 in $(B$$-$$V)$ for a cluster mass $M_c=10^2 m_\odot$ at ages $\log t\approx 7$, and diminishes substantially but not completely to about one hundredth of a magnitude at $\log t >7.9$ at cluster masses $M_c> 10^5 m_\odot$. At younger ages, it is still present even in massive clusters, and for $M_c \leqslant 10^4 m_\odot$ it is larger than 0.1 mag in $(B$$-$$V)$. Only for very massive clusters ($M_c>10^6 m_\odot$) with ages $\log t< 7.5$ is the offset small (of the order of 0.04 mag) and smaller than the typical observational error of colours of extragalactic clusters.
astro-ph.GA:Star clusters are found in all sorts of environments and their formation and evolution is inextricably linked to the star formation process. Their eventual destruction can result from a number of factors at different times, but the process can be investigated as a whole through the study of the cluster age distribution. Observations of populous cluster samples reveal a distribution following a power law of index approximately -1. In this work we use M33 as a test case to examine the age distribution of an archetypal cluster population and show that it is in fact the evolving shape of the mass detection limit that defines this trend. That is to say, any magnitude-limited sample will appear to follow a dN/dt=1/t, while cutting the sample according to mass gives rise to a composite structure, perhaps implying a dependence of the cluster disruption process on mass. In the context of this framework, we examine different models of cluster disruption from both theoretical and observational standpoints.
astro-ph.GA:Globular clusters are an important test bed for Newtonian gravity in the weak-acceleration regime, which is vital to our understanding of the nature of the gravitational interaction. Recent claims have been made that the velocity dispersion profiles of globular clusters flatten out at large radii, despite an apparent paucity of dark matter in such objects, indicating the need for a modification of gravitational theories. We continue our investigation of this claim, with the largest spectral samples ever obtained of 47 Tucanae and M55. Furthermore, this large sample allows for an accurate metallicity calibration based on the equivalent widths of the calcium triplet lines and K band magnitude of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. Assuming an isothermal distribution, the rotations of each cluster are also measured with both clusters exhibiting clear rotation signatures. The global velocity dispersions of NGC 121 and Kron 3, two globular clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud, are also calculated. By applying a simple dynamical model to the velocity dispersion profiles of 47 Tuc and M55, we calculate their mass-to-light profiles, total masses and central velocity dispersions. We find no statistically significant flattening of the velocity dispersion at large radii for M55, and a marked increase in the profile of 47 Tuc for radii greater than approximately half the tidal radius. We interpret this increase as an evaporation signature, indicating that 47 Tuc is undergoing, or has undergone, core-collapse, but find no requirement for dark matter or a modification of gravitational theories in either cluster.
astro-ph.GA:We present the results of AKARI observations of the O-rich supernova remnant G292.0+1.8 using six IRC and four FIS bands covering 2.7-26.5 um and 50-180 um, respectively. The AKARI images show two prominent structures; a bright equatorial ring structure and an outer elliptical shell structure. The equatorial ring structure is clumpy and incomplete with its western end opened. The outer shell is almost complete and slightly squeezed along the north-south direction. The central position of the outer shell is ~ 1' northwest from the embedded pulsar and coincides with the center of the equatorial ring structure. The equatorial ring and the elliptical shell structures were partly visible in optical and/or X-rays, but they are much more clearly revealed in our AKARI images. There is no evident difference in infrared colors of the two prominent structures, which is consistent with the previous proposition that both structures are of circumstellar origin. However, we have detected faint infrared emission of a considerably high 15 to 24 um ratio associated with the supernova ejecta in the southeastern and northwestern areas. Our IRC spectra show that the high ratio is at least partly due to the emission lines from Ne ions in the supernova ejecta material. In addition we detect a narrow, elongated feature outside the SNR shell. We derive the physical parameters of the infrared-emitting dust grains in the shocked circumstellar medium and compare the result with model calculations of dust destruction by a SN shock. The AKARI results suggest that the progenitor was at the center of the infrared circumstellar shell in red supergiant stage and that the observed asymmetry in the SN ejecta could be a result of either a dense circumstellar medium in the equatorial plane and/or an asymmetric explosion.
astro-ph.GA:Hard X-ray surveys have proven remarkably efficient in detecting intermediate polars and asynchronous polars, two of the rarest type of cataclysmic variable (CV). Here we present a global study of hard X-ray selected intermediate polars and asynchronous polars, focusing particularly on the link between hard X-ray properties and spin/orbital periods. To this end, we first construct a new sample of these objects by cross-correlating candidate sources detected in INTEGRAL/IBIS observations against catalogues of known CVs. We find 23 cataclysmic variable matches, and also present an additional 9 (of which 3 are definite) likely magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) identified by others through optical follow-ups of IBIS detections. We also include in our analysis hard X-ray observations from Swift/BAT and SUZAKU/HXD in order to make our study more complete. We find that most hard X-ray detected mCVs have P_{spin}/P_{orb}<0.1 above the period gap. In this respect we also point out the very low number of detected systems in any band between P_{spin}/P_{orb}=0.3 and P_{spin}/P_{orb}=1 and the apparent peak of the P_{spin}/P_{orb} distribution at about 0.1. The observational features of the P_{spin} - P_{orb} plane are discussed in the context of mCV evolution scenarios. We also present for the first time evidence for correlations between hard X-ray spectral hardness and P_{spin}, P_{orb} and P_{spin}/P_{orb}. An attempt to explain the observed correlations is made in the context of mCV evolution and accretion footprint geometries on the white dwarf surface.
astro-ph.GA:We present the results of X-ray spectral analysis of 22 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a small scattering fraction selected from the Second XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue using hardness ratios. They are candidates of buried AGNs, since a scattering fraction, which is a fraction of scattered emission by the circumnuclear photoionized gas with respect to direct emission, can be used to estimate the size of the opening part of an obscuring torus. Their X-ray spectra are modeled by a combination of a power law with a photon index of 1.5-2 absorbed by a column density of 10^23-24 cm^-2, an unabsorbed power law, narrow Gaussian lines, and some additional soft components. We find that scattering fractions of 20 among 22 objects are less than a typical value (3%) for Seyfert2s observed so far. In particular, those of eight objects are smaller than 0.5%, which are in the range for buried AGNs found in recent hard X-ray surveys. Moreover, [O III] lambda5007 luminosities at given X-ray luminosities for some objects are smaller than those for Seyfert2s previously known. This fact could be interpreted as a smaller size of optical narrow emission line regions produced in the opening direction of the obscuring torus. These results indicate that they are strong candidates for the AGN buried in a very geometrically thick torus.
astro-ph.GA:We present new tests for disruption mechanisms of star clusters based on the bivariate mass-age distribution g(M,\tau). In particular, we derive formulae for g(M,\tau) for two idealized models in which the rate of disruption depends on the masses of the clusters and one in which it does not. We then compare these models with our Hubble Space Telescope observations of star clusters in the Antennae galaxies over the mass-age domain in which we can readily distinguish clusters from individual stars: \tau\la10^7(M/10^4 M_{\odot})^{1.3} yr. We find that the models with mass-dependent disruption are poor fits to the data, even with complete freedom to adjust several parameters, while the model with mass-independent disruption is a good fit. The successful model has the simple form g(M,\tau) \propto M^{-2} \tau^{-1}, with power-law mass and age distributions, dN/dM propto M^{-2} and dN/d\tau\propto\tau^{-1}. The predicted luminosity function is also a power law, dN/dL \propto L^{-2}, in good agreement with our observations of the Antennae clusters. The similarity of the mass functions of star clusters and molecular clouds indicates that the efficiency of star formation in the clouds is roughly independent of their masses. The age distribution of the massive young clusters is plausibly explained by the following combination of disruption mechanisms: (1) removal of interstellar material by stellar feedback, \tau \la 10^7$ yr; (2) continued stellar mass loss, 10^7 yr \la \tau \la 10^8 yr; (3), tidal disturbances by passing molecular clouds, \tau \ga 10^8 yr. None of these processes is expected to have a strong dependence on mass, consistent with our observations of the Antennae clusters. We speculate that this simple picture also applies--at least approximately--to the clusters in many other galaxies.
astro-ph.GA:We report the first detection of the Zeeman effect in the 36 GHz Class I methanol maser line. The observations were carried out with 13 antennas of the EVLA toward the high mass star forming region M8E. Based on our adopted Zeeman splitting factor of $z = 1.7 Hz/mG, we detect a line of sight magnetic field of -31.3 +/- 3.5 mG and 20.2 +/- 3.5 mG to the northwest and southeast of the maser line peak respectively. This change in sign over a 1300 AU size scale may indicate that the masers are tracing two regions with different fields, or that the same field curves across the regions where the masers are being excited. The detected fields are not significantly different from the magnetic fields detected in the 6.7 GHz Class II methanol maser line, indicating that methanol masers may trace the large scale magnetic field, or that the magnetic field remains unchanged during the early evolution of star forming regions. Given what is known about the densities at which 36 GHz methanol masers are excited, we find that the magnetic field is dynamically significant in the star forming region.
astro-ph.GA:Based on constraints from microlensing and disk stability, both with and without limitations from wide binary surveys, we estimate the total number and entropy of intermediate mass black holes. Given the visible universe comprises $10^{11}$ halos each of mass $\sim 10^{12} M_{\odot}$, typical core black holes of mean mass $\sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$ set the dimensionless entropy ($S/k$) of the universe at a thousand googols. Identification of all dark matter as black holes sets the dimensionless entropy of the universe at ten million googols, implying that dark matter can contribute over 99% of entropy, which favors all dark matter as black holes in the mass regime of $ \sim 10^{5} M_{\odot}$.
astro-ph.GA:To study the possible origin of the huge helium enrichment attributed to the stars on the blue main sequence of Omega Centauri, we make use of a chemical evolution model that has proven able to reproduce other major observed properties of the cluster, namely, its stellar metallicity distribution function, age-metallicity relation and trends of several abundance ratios with metallicity. In this framework, the key condition to satisfy all the available observational constraints is that a galactic-scale outflow develops in a much more massive parent system, as a consequence of multiple supernova explosions in a shallow potential well. This galactic wind must carry out preferentially the metals produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, whereas elements restored to the interstellar medium through low-energy stellar winds by both asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars must be mostly retained. Assuming that helium is ejected through slow winds by both AGB stars and fast rotating massive stars (FRMSs), the interstellar medium of Omega Centauri's parent galaxy gets naturally enriched in helium in the course of its evolution.
astro-ph.GA:We present results of a search for objects with H-alpha excess, such as cataclysmic variables (CVs) and chromospherically active binaries (ABs), as counterparts to X-ray sources detected with Chandra satellite observatory in six Galactic globular clusters (GCs): M4, M28, M30, M71, M80, NGC 6752. Binary systems play a critical role in the evolution of GCs, serving as an internal energy source countering the tendency of GC cores to collapse. Theoretical studies predict dozens of CVs in the cores of some GCs (e.g., 130 for M28, 40 for M30). A number of such binaries is also expected outside the core radius. However, few CVs are known so far in GCs. Using subtraction technique applied to images taken with the 4.1-m SOAR telescope we have found 27 objects with H-alpha excess in the field of the observed clusters, of which nine are likely associated with the clusters. Four are candidate CVs, four candidate ABs, one could be either a CV or an AB. One H-alpha object seems to be a background galaxy, while other 17 detected objects are probably foreground or background stars.
astro-ph.GA:Automated search for star clusters in J,H,K_s data from 2MASS catalog has been performed using the method developed by Koposov et. al (2008). We have found and verified 153 new clusters in the interval of the galactic latitude -24 < b < 24 degrees. Color excesses E(B-V), distance moduli and ages were determined for 130 new and 14 yet-unstudied known clusters. In this paper, we publish a catalog of coordinates, diameters, and main parameters of all the clusters under study. A special web-site available at http://ocl.sai.msu.ru has been developed to facilitate dissemination and scientific usage of the results.
astro-ph.GA:We present a new mass estimate for the Hercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph), based on the revised velocity dispersion obtained by Aden et al. (2009, arXiv:0908.3489).   The removal of a significant foreground contamination using newly acquired Stromgren photometry has resulted in a reduced velocity dispersion. Using this new velocity dispersion of 3.72 +/- 0.91 km/s, we find a mass of M_300=1.9^{+1.1}_{-0.8} 10^6 M_sun within the central 300 pc, which is also the half-light radius, and a mass of M_433=3.7_{-1.6}^{+2.2} 10^6 M_sun within the reach of our data to 433 pc, significantly lower than previous estimates. We derive an overall mass-to-light ratio of M_433/L=103^{+83}_{-48} M_sun/L_sun. Our mass estimate calls into question recent claims of a common mass scale for dSph galaxies.   Additionally, we find tentative evidence for a velocity gradient in our kinematic data of 16 +/- 3 km/s/kpc, and evidence of an asymmetric extension in the light distribution at about 0.5 kpc. We explore the possibility that these features are due to tidal interactions with the Milky Way. We show that there is a self-consistent model in which Hercules has an assumed tidal radius of r_t = 485 pc, an orbital pericentre of r_p = 18.5 +/- 5 kpc, and a mass within r_t of M_{tid,r_t}=5.2 +/- 2.7 10^6 M_sun. Proper motions are required to test this model. Although we cannot exclude models in which Hercules contains no dark matter, we argue that Hercules is more likely to be a dark matter dominated system which is currently experiencing some tidal disturbance of its outer parts.
astro-ph.GA:Is the turbulence in cluster-forming regions internally driven by stellar outflows or the consequence of a large-scale turbulent cascade? We address this question by studying the turbulent energy spectrum in NGC 1333. Using synthetic 13CO maps computed with a snapshot of a supersonic turbulence simulation, we show that the VCS method of Lazarian and Pogosyan provides an accurate estimate of the turbulent energy spectrum. We then apply this method to the 13CO map of NGC 1333 from the COMPLETE database. We find the turbulent energy spectrum is a power law, E(k) k^-beta, in the range of scales 0.06 pc < ell < 1.5 pc, with slope beta=1.85\pm 0.04. The estimated energy injection scale of stellar outflows in NGC 1333 is ell_inj 0.3 pc, well resolved by the observations. There is no evidence of the flattening of the energy spectrum above the scale ell_inj predicted by outflow-driven simulations and analytical models. The power spectrum of integrated intensity is also a nearly perfect power law in the range of scales 0.16 pc < ell < 7.9 pc, with no feature above ell_inj. We conclude that the observed turbulence in NGC 1333 does not appear to be driven primarily by stellar outflows.
astro-ph.GA:The Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS) covers the whole sky north of Dec(2000) = -5 deg. on a fully sampled angular grid. Using state-of-the-art FPGA-spectrometers we perform a Milky Way and an extragalactic HI survey in parallel. Moreover, the high dynamic range and short dump time of the HI spectra allow to overcome the vast majority of all radio-frequency-interference (RFI) events. The Milky Way data will be corrected for the stray-radiation bias which warrants a main-beam efficiency of 99%. Towards the whole survey area we exceed the sensitivity limit of HIPASS, while towards the Sloan-Digital-Sky-Survey (SDSS) area EBHIS offers an order of magnitude higher mass sensitivity. The Milky Way data will be a cornerstone for multi-frequency astrophysics, while the extragalactic part will disclose detailed information on the structure formation of the local universe.
astro-ph.GA:Analytic distribution functions (DFs) for the Galactic disc are discussed. The DFs depend on action variables and their predictions for observable quantities are explored under the assumption that the motion perpendicular to the Galactic plane is adiabatically invariant during motion within the plane. A promising family of DFs is defined that has several adjustable parameters. A standard DF is identified by adjusting these parameters to optimise fits to the stellar density in the column above the Sun, and to the velocity distribution of nearby stars and stars ~1 kpc above the Sun. The optimum parameters imply a radial structure for the disc which is consistent with photometric studies of the Milky Way and similar galaxies, and that 20 per cent of the disc's luminosity comes from thick disc. The fits suggest that the value of the V component of the Sun's peculiar velocity should be revised upwards from 5.2 km/s to ~11 km/s. It is argued that the standard DF provides a significantly more reliable way to divide solar-neighbourhood stars into members of the thin and thick discs than is currently used. The standard DF provides predictions for surveys of stars observed at any distance from the Sun. It is anticipated that DFs of the type discussed here will provide useful starting points for much more sophisticated chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way.
astro-ph.GA:During searches for new optical Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) in the high resolution, high sensitivity Anglo-Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST) HAlpha survey of the southern Galactic plane, we uncovered a variety of filamentary and more diffuse, extensive nebular structures in the vicinity of Wolf-Rayet (WR) star 48 (Theta Muscae), only some of which were previously recognised. We used the double-beam spectrograph of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatory (MSSSO) 2.3-m to obtain low and mid resolution spectra of selected new filaments and structures in this region. Despite spectral similarities between the optical spectra of WR star shells and SNRs, a careful assessment of the new spectral and morphological evidence from our deep HAlpha imagery suggests that the putative shell of Theta Mus is not a WR shell at all, as has been commonly accepted, but is rather part of a more complex area of large-scale overlapping nebulosities in the general field of the WR star. The emission comprises a possible new optical supernova remnant and a likely series of complex H II regions. Finally, we present the intriguing detection of apparent collimated, directly opposing, ionized outflows close to Theta Mus itself which appears unique among such stars. Although possible artifacts or a temporary phenomenon monitoring of the star is recommended.
astro-ph.GA:We study electromagnetic streaming instabilities in thermal viscous regions of rotating astrophysical objects, such as, magnetized accretion disks, molecular clouds, their cores, and elephant trunks. The obtained results can also be applied to any regions of interstellar medium, where different equilibrium velocities between charged species can arise. We consider a weakly ionized multicomponent plasma consisting of neutrals and magnetized electrons, ions, and dust grains. The effect of perturbation of collisional frequencies due to density perturbations of species is taken into account. We obtain general expressions for perturbed velocities of species involving the thermal pressure and viscosity in the case in which perturbations propagate perpendicular to the background magnetic field. The dispersion relation is derived and investigated for axisymmetric perturbations. New compressible instabilities generated due to different equilibrium velocities of different charged species are found in the cold and thermal limits when the viscosity of neutrals can be neglected or is important. The viscosity of magnetized charged species is negligible for considered perturbations having wavelengths much larger than the Larmor radius of species. At the same time, the neutrals are shown to be immobile in electromagnetic perturbations when their viscosity is sufficiently large.
astro-ph.GA:Astrophysical parameters (\textit{age, reddening, distance, core and cluster radii}) of 14 open clusters (OCs) projected close to the Galactic plane are derived with 2MASS photometry. The OCs are Be 63, Be 84, Cz 6, Cz 7, Cz 12, Ru 141, Ru 144, Ru 172, FSR 101, FSR 1430, FSR 1471, FSR 162, FSR 178 and FSR 198. The OCs Be 63, Be 84, Ru 141, Ru 144, and Ru 172 are studied in more detail than in previous works, while the others have astrophysical parameters derived for the first time. The open clusters of the sample are located at $d_\odot=1.6-7.1$ kpc from the Sun and at Galactocentric distances $5.5-11.8$ kpc, with age in the range 10 Myr to 1.5 Gyr and reddening $E(B-V)$ in the range $0.19-2.56$ mag. The core and cluster radii are in the range $0.27-1.88$ pc and $2.2-11.27$ pc, respectively. Cz 6 and FSR 198 are the youngest OCs of this sample, with a population of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, while FSR 178 is the oldest cluster.
astro-ph.GA:The condensation of diffuse gas into molecular clouds occurs at a rate driven largely by turbulent dissipation. This process still has to be caught in action and characterized. A mosaic of 13 fields was observed in the CO(1-0) line with the IRAM-PdB interferometer in the translucent environment of two low-mass dense cores. The large size of the mosaic compared to the resolution (4 arcsec) is unprecedented in the study of the small-scale structure of diffuse molecular gas. Eight weak and elongated structures of thicknesses as small as 3 mpc (600 AU) and lengths up to 70mpc are found. These are not filaments because once merged with short-spacing data, they appear as the sharp edges of larger-scale structures. Six out of eight form quasi-parallel pairs at different velocities and different position angles. This cannot be the result of chance alignment. The velocity-shears estimated for the three pairs include the highest ever measured far from star forming regions (780 km/s/pc). Because the large scale structures have sharp edges, with little or no overlap, they have to be thin CO-layers. Their edges mark a sharp transition between a CO-rich component and a gas undetected in the CO line because of its low CO abundance, presumably the cold neutral medium. We propose that these sharp edges are the first directly-detected manifestations of the intermittency of interstellar turbulence. The large velocity-shears reveal an intense straining field, responsible for a local dissipation rate several orders of magnitude above average, possibly at the origin of the thin CO-layers.
astro-ph.GA:We investigate the young stellar population in and near the cometary globule Ori,I-2. The analysis is based on deep Nordic Optical Telescope R-band and H-alpha images, JCMT SCUBA 450 and 850 micron images combined with near-infrared 2MASS photometry and mid-infrared archival Spitzer images obtained with the IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron), and MIPS (24 and 70 micron) instruments. We identify a total of 125 sources within the 5'x5' region imaged by IRAC. Of these sources 87 are detected in the R-band image and 51 are detected in the 2MASS survey. The detailed physical properties of the sources are explored using a combination of near/mid-infrared color-color diagrams, greybody fitting of SEDs and an online SED fitting tool that uses a library of 2D radiation transfer based accretion models of young stellar objects with disks. Ori I-2 shows clear evidence of triggered star formation with four young low luminosity pre-main sequence stars embedded in the globule. At least two, possibly as many as four, additional low-mass PMS objects, were discovered in the field which are probably part of the young sigma-Orionis cluster. Among the PMS stars which have formed in the globule, MIR-54 is a young, deeply embedded Class 0/I object, MIR-51 and 52 are young Class II sources, while MIR-89 is a more evolved, heavily extincted Class II object with its apparent colors mimicking a Class 0/I object. The Class II source, MIR-52, which is strong a H-alpha emission line star appears to drive an outflow approximately aligned with the outflow from MIR-54, and because of the proximity of the two outflows, either star could contribute. MIR-89 appears to excite a low excitation HH object, HH 992, discovered for the first time in this study.
astro-ph.GA:Although they are only minor constituents of the interstellar medium, halogen-containing molecules are of special interest because of their unique thermochemistry. Here, we present a theoretical study of the chemistry of interstellar molecules containing the halogen elements chlorine and fluorine. We have modeled both diffuse and dense molecular clouds, making use of updated estimates for the rates of several key chemical processes. We present predictions for the abundances of the three halogen molecules that have been detected to date in the interstellar medium: HF, CF+ and HCl. As in our previous study of fluorine-bearing interstellar molecules, we predict HF to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of fluorine within both diffuse and dense molecular clouds; we expect the Herschel Space Observatory to detect widespread absorption in the HF J=1-0 transition. Our updated model now overpredicts the CF+ abundance by a factor ~10 relative to observations of the Orion Bar; this discrepancy has widened because we now adopt a laboratory measurement of the CF+ dissociative recombination rate that is smaller than the estimate we adopted previously. This disagreement suggests that the reaction of C+ with HF proceeds more slowly than the capture rate assumed in our model; a laboratory measurement of this reaction rate would be very desirable. Our model predicts diffuse cloud HCl abundances that are similar to those predicted previously and detected tentatively toward zeta Oph. Two additional species are potentially detectable from photodissociation regions: the H2Cl+ and HCl+ molecular ions. Ortho-H2Cl+ has its lowest-lying transition in the millimeter spectral region observable from the ground, and the lowest rotational transition of HCl+ is observable with Herschel's HIFI instrument.
astro-ph.GA:Isotropic diffusion models for Galactic cosmic ray transport put tight constraints on the maximum convection velocity in the halo. For a half halo height of 4 kpc the maximum convection speed is limited to 40 km/s in the halo, since otherwise the constraints from local secondary to primary ratios and radioactive isotopes cannot be met. The ROSAT Galactic wind observations of wind speeds up to 760 km/s therefore constitute a problem for diffusion models. It is shown that such wind speeds are possible, if the diffusion coefficient in the halo is different from the diffusion coefficient in the disk. The radial dependence of the wind velocity was taken to be proportional to the source strength, as expected from winds which are sustained by cosmic ray pressure. In this case the cosmic ray density and with it the diffuse $\gamma$-ray production from nuclear interactions are suppressed near the sources. This solves in a natural way the problem of the soft gradient in the radial dependence of the $\gamma$-ray flux. Furthermore, the large bulge over disk ratio in positron annihilation as observed by INTEGRAL, can be explained by positron escape from the disk in such a model.
